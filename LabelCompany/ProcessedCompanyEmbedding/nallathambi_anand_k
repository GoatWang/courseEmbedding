on important market trends and areas of strategic focus jim will review financial results for the quarter and frank will cover operational highlights and provide color on our financial guidance and capital return corelogic is off to a great start in  with strong growth in revenues operating profits cash flow and adjusted eps revenues for the second quarter were up  operating income was up  adjusted ebitda was up  and adjusted eps was up  for the first half revenues were  above last year and operating income was up  adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps rose  and  respectively in terms of strategic imperatives a major focus area over the last nine months has been the scaling of our property valuation solutions group since the launch of the vsg in september of  we have acquired a significant set of data technology analytics and servicesrelated assets focused on property appraisal these assets build upon and complement a number of valuationrelated data and analytics services offered by corelogic before the launch of the vsg most recently we completed the acquisition of fnc in late april this is a foundational platform asset for vsg in addition during the second quarter we assembled a core leadership team for vsg and completed a series of planning and feedback sessions with key constituents in the valuation space these sessions will help us develop a comprehensive set of property valuation and collateral assessment solutions that connect market participants with supply chain service providers the market for residential property valuation in the us is about  billion annually based on our discussions with lenders regulators and service providers we believe that the area would benefit from operational scale enhanced technology and the application of data and analytics the opportunity to transform the way real estate assets are valued and to bring greater transparency to the underwriting process makes this a significant medium and longterm growth opportunity for us during the second quarter we delivered strong growth in our insurance geospatial and international operations over the past five years we have increased revenues contributed by these units almost threefold we expect these businesses to contribute about  of our total revenue in  up from  five years ago expanding our footprint and building market leadership in valuation insurance geospatial and international has been a major success and will continue to be a strategic focus area these businesses are highly synergistic with our core property intelligence assets and are a significant growth opportunity for us over the last six months we continued to scale back certain noncore product lines tightened discretionary and projectrelated spending from a market perspective much of this discretionary spending has been redirected by industry participants to cope with the challenging regulatory environment including the need to invest in such areas as compliance management information security and vendor oversight we are entering the balance of  with a clear pathway to accelerating growth actually deploying new and unique datadriven solutions that enable participants in the real estate ecosystem to more precisely underwrite and manage their risks and capitalize on opportunities as i have mentioned on past earnings calls the us mortgage market is continuing to transition to a purchasedriven cycle we believe the transition will continue fueled by expected increases in population the firsttime home buyers and plus fewer cash purchases we have recently experienced a rise in refinancing activity spurred by the reaction to brexit and historically low interest rates however based on current mortgage industry predictions we do not expect this elevated level of activity to continue through the rest of  based on our research we now believe the ongoing growth in home purchase activity and the return to normalized levels of refinancing support a new normal mortgage market of  trillion to  trillion going forward we have a long established track record of consistently outperforming market volume trends this strong performance has resulted from our focus on scaling our core business units through market share gains product development as well as smart acquisitions in closing i want to thank our employees clients and shareholders for their continued support we delivered a strong first half in  i believe our performance demonstrates the value creation opportunities inherent in our strategic plan our focus remains squarely on strong operational execution and positioning corelogic for superior longterm growth and stakeholder value creation with that i will now turn the call over to jim balas for an update on our financial results jim has been a key contributor to corelogic since  and were very proud to have him serve as our chief financial officer frank and i look forward to working with jim to take corelogic to even greater heights jim james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc thank you anand and good morning everyone today i will recap our second quarter financial results and provide some additional color on our recent bond redemption and the upsizing of our credit facility as anand mentioned second quarter revenues operating income adjusted ebitda cash flow and adjusted eps were up strongly from  as we have over the past several years we outpaced the us mortgage market volumes benefiting from the market leadership of our core property intelligence and underwriting in risk management solution areas notable second quarter financial highlights included first we grew revenues  this was boosted by the launch of the vsg and underlying growth of  from core product lines positive organic growth was achieved despite reduced levels of discretionary spending by clients in the mortgage industry next we increased operating income by  and adjusted ebitda by  while continuing to make important investments in growth productivity compliance and technology third aggressive execution against our cost productivity and efficiency targets help drive up profits and selffund reinvestment during the quarter we focused on simplifying our organization structure improving operational processes and reducing sga cost levels fourth on a trailingmonth basis we converted  of our adjusted ebitda to free cash flow free cash flow conversion rates remain strong as we enhance our business mix and manage working capital and finally during july we upsized our term loan facility and redeemed our outstanding senior notes due in  this should provide lower cost funding and additional flexibility going forward now i will cover the financial results in more detail second quarter revenues totaled  million compared with  million in  the  increase was driven primarily by the pi segment pi segment revenues rose  to  million driven principally by the vsg and growth in insurance and spatial solutions in international rmw segment revenues were in line with  levels as market share and pricing gains offset reduced projectrelated revenues and the winddown of certain noncore product lines operating income from continuing operations was up  to  million for the quarter benefits from revenue gains and productivity more than offset costs associated with the vsg launch optimization of the capital structure integration severance and investments in cyber security and compliance operating margin was  after absorbing these costs and investments second quarter margins were mostly in line with  levels second quarter net income and diluted eps from continuing operations totaled  million and  compared with  million and  respectively in  growth in net income and diluted eps reflects the operating upsides previously discussed and the positive impact of share repurchases which more than offset higher taxes in the quarter adjusted diluted eps was up  to  for the quarter reflecting the positive impacts of growth cost reduction and share repurchases adjusted ebitda was up  to  million in the second quarter largely due to revenue growth and the benefits of cost productivity programs finally free cash flow continued to be very strong in the second quarter on a trailingmonth basis as of june   free cash flow totaled  million a  conversion rate of our adjusted ebitda the balance of my prepared remarks today will focus on our capital structure optimization as recently announced on july  we paid  million to complete the redemption of all of our outstanding senior notes due in  we funded this redemption through a  million expansion an amendment of our existing credit facility after upsizing our term loan and redeeming our senior notes corelogic had total debt of  billion consisting of  billion in outstanding term loans and  million drawn against the  million revolving credit facility our updated capital structure provides corelogic with substantial additional financial flexibility and significantly lowers interest expense as we have discussed in the past corelogics strong operating results free cash flow and balanced capital management approach allow the company to invest in our strategic programs and also to return capital to shareholders as we maintain prudent debt levels we had a strong second quarter and first half and i look forward to a successful second half of  thank you for your support and i will now turn the call over to frank frank d martell  chief operating officer thank you jim today im going to outline the progress we are making capitalizing on our growth opportunities and expanding margins i will also provide some thoughts on the increase in our  financial guidance and capital return targets as jim and anand highlighted we had a strong second quarter and first half importantly we continue to execute against our strategic imperatives which are focused on delivering unique property insights that allow participants in the real estate ecosystem to make better decisions in the areas of prospect identification underwriting and continuous risk management and monitoring our consistent focus on driving scale and operating leverage cost productivity and cash flow allows us to reinvest in leadingedge product development technology initiatives and risk management programs this helps us to sustain our competitive advantage and broaden our capabilities corelogics first half revenues were up  driven by the scaling of our property valuation solutions group we think there is a unique opportunity to transform the property valuation experience in the us and we believe we are wellpositioned to do so given our scale and datadriven insights regarding the vsg we expect to exit this year with a wellintegrated appraisal operation that consistently delivers to the highest service levels we also expect to see the initial benefits of data and operational synergies between the acquired vsg assets and other corelogic operations completing the integration of our capabilities and realizing the full potential of vsg will be a significant multiyear endeavor in addition to vsgrelated growth drivers we also launched a number of new products and enhancements over the past  to  months a number of these should become industrystandard tools over time and several are progressively gaining traction in the marketplace in the case of our insurance unit new products are helping to drive accelerated growth rates our focus on pricing is also yielding benefits and finally we are seeing upsides from crosssellingrelated point solutions through more integrated offerings and packages as we scale and drive top line growth were also relentlessly pursuing firstquartile levels of cost efficiency we are committed to achieving plus adjusted ebitda margins based on a normalized us mortgage market and after accounting for the buildout of our valuation solutions platform we believe we can achieve our margin goals through the combination of profitable growth favorable shifts in revenue mix as well as business model transformation and cost productivity regarding cost management we expect to save at least  million this year by consolidating facilities reducing sga costs outsourcing certain business activities and other operational improvements these programs should also contribute an additional  million in savings in  actual second quarter adjusted ebitda margin was  a bit ahead of our expectations driven by upside in the pi segment the launch of the vsg had a roughly  basis point impact on total company adjusted second quarter ebitda margins our  yeartodate financial results provide an indication of the effectiveness of our laserlike focus on delivering our business plan we have a strong management team dedicated to delivering consistent stakeholder value over the past five years our strategic growth and operational excellence programs have produced doubledigit compound growth rates for revenue adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps at the same time the price of our common shares has risen more than threefold i will close my prepared remarks today with a brief discussion around our increased  financial guidance and share repurchase targets we are increasing our  revenue adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps guidance ranges based on our strong first half performance and higher than initially expected  us mortgage unit volumes we now expect to generate revenue of  billion to  billion adjusted ebitda of  million to  million and adjusted eps at  to  per share the midpoints of these ranges generate annual growth rates of   and  for revenue adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps respectively our increased guidance reflects the following first our latest view of  us mortgage origination volumes second the impact of the delayed closing of fnc third lower interest expenses and fourth the positive impact of higher share repurchases in terms of the third quarter of  based on seasonality and our current view of origination unit volume trends and timing of our investment to cost management programs we believe that adjusted ebitda should be in line with or modestly above second quarter  levels finally we have increased our share buyback program to  million shares this year this increase is consistent with our longheld practice of rewarding our shareholders through a significant level of annual capital return this is made possible by strong revenue and profit growth and our high cash flow conversion so far this year weve repurchased  shares we have and will continue to repurchase shares using cash generated from operations we also plan to make voluntary debt repayments lower debt levels and growth and profitability should result in debt to adjusted ebitda ratios approaching  times by year end although our market capitalization has increased significantly over the past several years we believe that our current share place does not reflect the full intrinsic value of our business today and its future potential therefore in our view the ongoing repurchase of substantial numbers of our common shares remains a significant source of potential value creation for our shareholders in closing corelogic continues to deliver strategically operationally and financially over the long term we remain committed to delivering consistently superior value creation through the realization of our vision of providing unique property level insights to the global real estate ecosystem thank you all for your time today ill now turn the call back over to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of bill warmington of wells fargo your line is open william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc good morning everyone anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer good morning james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc good morning bill william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc and congratulations to jim on the promotion james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc thanks bill william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc so first question i just wanted to ask about your forecast for the  trillion to  trillion for  the mba is forecasting a  trillion market where does your forecast differ with the mba forecast and what gives you confidence in it frank d martell  chief operating officer bill this is frank just to clarify on the quotation  trillion to  trillion is a new normal level it doesnt refer specifically to  we havent provided a viewpoint on  origination volumes william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc okay frank d martell  chief operating officer as you may remember based on the environmental factors in the mortgage market on call it kind of a  trillion market is a normal – kind of new normal postrecession and i think based on whats been happening thats actually a little bit more favorable at the  trillion to  trillion william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc sure i mean right now youre trending at about  trillion to  trillion for the year so i mean that would seem – it would seem potentially like a reasonable expectation for next year but anyway what are you seeing in the – from your vantage point thats giving you confidence in that level anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer for the last couple of years of being in that area and i think assuming  is going to be flat as  because thats what most of the industry predictions are its right about that number bill so unless something drastically changes we think that thats a pretty good new normal with some yearly fluctuations based on market conditions william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc got it and then for my second question on your unit volumes it looked like flood was up about  tax up about  and credit was particularly strong at  just wanted to ask about what was driving the different volumes there james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc yeah so i think obviously they are slightly different markets and we have different shares the credit number is a little bit higher due to – weve had actually some pretty good success in the big mass market on taking some volume and taking some market share bill in the last couple of years so thats been – that accounts for the slight differential there and then weve had some different share gains and different client adds so that accounts slightly in any given quarter the rates may vary a little bit william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc okay anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer bill also the normal seasonality is such that credit comes really first and as they look to write apps and flood and tax come a lot later tax being the last one as they  so you could have normal seasonality william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc got it well thank you very much anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is from darrin peller of barclays your line is open darrin peller  barclays capital inc thanks guys i just want to start off trying to get a bigger picture understanding of growth trends from your perspective when we look at the organic rate of the business being i guess around flat when you back out the deals or maybe  constant currency and then i guess we get to around  when we add back the noncore projectrelated revenue that i think you guys have tried to talk about before that you consider sort of discontinued i guess just were in a relatively flat market now at least from a number of loan standpoint and so can you help us bridge what would get us from what is around lets call it a ish organic growth rate to the mid to highsingle digit growth that you talked about longer term being able to do frank d martell  chief operating officer yeah bill this is frank i think weve discussed a couple of things on the call and i think there are – the good news is there are a number of levers that we think are going to help us there one i talked about pricing so weve invested in some additional resources to help us accelerate the rate of price increases certainly coming through the recession and out of the recession essentially we werent getting any price so we think we can get a couple of percentage points of growth as a base for accelerated organic growth rates secondly i think the product introductions that i mentioned over the last couple of years weve really just fired up that engine of growth for us and i think that were starting to see some clear traction there i think we had the best year the best quarter growthwise in the insurance area in a great long period of time and thats really driven to a fair degree by the product launches that weve made over the last  months so i think thats a good validation that we can have success in the market with the new products and we have a variety of those both in the core mortgage area but also in the insurance international areas as well in the geospatial areas some new models et cetera so i think the second area beyond pricing is our product introduction area the third area i think as anand kind of alluded to the time period of the last certainly several quarters and i think this is an area that i think everybodys kind of under estimated the impact of the burden of the regulatory environment and the fact of the matter is that a lot of the lenders in particular the servicers and other participants in the market are really struggling to keep up and to manage the regulatory burdens which are expanding and i think whereas we used to get a fair amount of discretionary spending thats somewhat dried up and the final area is i think obviously we talked about this on past calls the fourth area that gives us good solid support for an accelerated growth rate is the fact that these noncore areas we had five or six areas that were just – collectively they were a meaningful number – amount of revenue but individually theyre somewhat small but theyre little areas of noncore that were just biting the bullet and getting through so this year were bearing the brunt of that now and that will dissipate as we go forward obviously so theres four areas – there are others but those are four principal areas that give us pretty good foundation for our expectation of an accelerated growth rate darrin peller  barclays capital inc and is vsg a part of that also i mean as sort of the new products just i imagine expanding the opportunity there as youve finally gotten through really the – youre going through the integration now and everything the deals i imagine – i mean thats definitely predicating a lot of basis for investors frank d martell  chief operating officer yeah i think as anand mentioned one of the things that we feel about vsg is theres tremendous data content resident in those assets that we can leverage so we see a great deal of synergy beyond just – obviously its a huge market space thats really fragmented so i think that thats an area of tremendous organic growth and inorganic growth as well its a huge – at  billion the us – and thats just the us thats not international we have a very large footprint in valuation in australia as well so to that extent were a global leader in valuation wed like to take that to other geographies darrin peller  barclays capital inc thanks just for my followup the guidance reason it was predicated on roughly flat number of loans yearoveryear versus a prior expectation i think for a decline of around  or i guess its an improvement now of around a couple of hundred billion dollars from your prior expectation volume historically i know you suggested around  million of incremental ebitda for every  billion or so so just touching on the raise in guidance of  million in ebitda i mean is it – instead of what would be around  million i mean is it related to integration investments or just conservatism in the outlook or anything else we should think of thanks guys frank d martell  chief operating officer yeah so i think obviously a part of that is looking at unit volumes versus dollars so theres darrin peller  barclays capital inc yeah frank d martell  chief operating officer a little bit of – yeah theres definitely price inflation there i think were pretty well in line with our historical sensitivity levels we did have a month delay in fnc that cost us a little bit so there are some swings and roundabouts there but i think if you factor that in factor our view of the strengthening dollar versus the – some of the foreign currencies you know that story so theres a few of those swings and roundabouts that take away a little bit but i think the strong raise in guidance – obviously i think as we mentioned in the last call were still looking at – we have a fair amount of revenue coming through vsg thats concentrated in a couple of clients so reflecting the mortgage market changes our sensitivity will be changing a little bit well provide a little bit of an update on that toward the end of this year darrin peller  barclays capital inc and have you – just the last question im getting these from two clients as we speak and ill be turning back to the queue have you provided any – or can you provide any opportunity of discussion around the opportunity for vsgs growth rate or is that just still too early to say in terms of what it can do over the next two to three years even frank d martell  chief operating officer were in a – because we see its a massive market opportunity so i think it can be very high we havent provided specific percentages but certainly its likely to be of an aggressive growth rate darrin peller  barclays capital inc okay great all right guys thanks very much operator thank you our next question is from jeff meuler of baird your line is open jeff p meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker close enough thanks can you give us a sense of the noncore products i think you said theres five to six areas that are getting bucketed in here just roughly what is the currentyear revenue contribution from those and then are there other products that youre flagging that maybe will be considered noncore a year or two from now and are kind of undergoing devaluation just trying to understand how much exposure we still have to this headwind james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc yeah in terms of the noncore products on a yeartoyear basis the impact to the quarter is probably about  million collectively jeff p meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker right but i guess what im wondering is do you still have  million of net exposure or just how far away are we working through those james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc probably exiting this year and a little bit into next year so i think its going to be over the next  months it is five to six some of the product lines have tails to them frank d martell  chief operating officer but jeff the vast majority is coming through the system now so as jim mentioned it will dissipate through the balance of this year so its – going forward it will be a materially lower factor and its mostly – this is mostly – we had a document retrieval business and some staff augmentation and a few other areas that were legacy from the default area – default services area so these are kind of bits and oddball units jeff p meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker okay james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc yeah the h impact is probably bigger than what well see in the back half of the year jeff p meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker okay and then on the new product introduction is there any way to roughly quantify the number of meaningful new products youre launching per year now relative to what it was i dont know three years ago or something like that and then on insurance i think this is the first time at least i remember you talking about new product development specific to insurance can you give us an example of a meaningful new product there frank d martell  chief operating officer yeah so we have – in terms of the numbers of new products id say that were now on a cadence of three to five material launches a year which for a company our size i think is probably appropriate it could vary from year to year but thats – i think as it relates to insurance we have different products that have been launched around different weather forensic models for example and different postevent surveillance so obviously when you have a weather event and it impacts properties we have a rapid response and surveillance product thats been launched so theres a number of other ones as well but as we – when we originally expanded our insurance footprint we talked about accelerating the growth rates from kind of a lowsingle digits and i think this is starting to – were starting to realize that objective which i think is again a good validation of the integration of accelerated growth opportunities in some of these areas and we think vsg kind of fits the same type of bill obviously its a much much bigger market space so the growth rates can be higher but were quite pleased with the insurance – the acceleration in insurance growth jeff p meuler  robert w baird  co inc broker got it thank you operator thank you our next question is from john campbell of stephens inc your line is open john campbell  stephens inc hey guys good morning congrats on a great quarter anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer thanks john campbell  stephens inc yeah just first on the guidance around margins i think in the first half you guys – i think incremental margin was about  guidance looks like its about  on the back half just trying to get a better grip on that ramp in the leverage just throughout the year i mean is that just largely from the tapering vsg integration spend frank d martell  chief operating officer its a couple of factors expenses should trend down in the back half of the year so thats number one and number two is obviously weve got fnc which is a higher margin area for more of the second quarter than first quarter and then we have basically our cost management program benefits as well kind of progressed so those are kind of the three areas john campbell  stephens inc okay and i think you guys might have originally called out maybe  million to  million in vsg integration costs have we largely seen all of that in the first half of the year frank d martell  chief operating officer no it runs through – it still runs through the balance of the year it comes down in the fourth quarter assuming everything goes to plan and so far so good so we still have – there are still integrationrelated costs obviously its a significant undertaking were dealing with our major partners there so we have to also manage to their needs as well so – but everything is going really well john campbell  stephens inc okay and then the restructuring of the debt it looks like you guys have increased the flexibility a little bit just curious about ma pipeline or maybe what the appetite for ma is from here frank d martell  chief operating officer yeah i think we were – as anand kind of mentioned were focused on doing smart deals so nothing major necessarily on the horizon at this point in time were pretty busy right now integrating what we have but certainly jim has done a great job of expanding our powder and i think we have a tremendous capital structure now so if something really synergistic or valuable appears we might be able to capitalize on it but as of now were kind of in the integration mode anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer yeah if we look at anything itll be probably product extensions and stuff i dont think we are – at this point at least i dont want to say never or no to anything but we dont have anything thats significant in our pipeline but just around that product offerings or project extensions john campbell  stephens inc thanks for taking our questions guys james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc thanks john operator thank you our next question is from geoffrey dunn of dowling  partners your line is open geoffrey murray dunn  dowling  partners securities llc thanks good morning guys a couple of number questions to start can you detail the incremental expense saves the business reinvestment and the integration expenses in the pi segment this quarter just to see what the moving parts are james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc im sorry can you repeat that geoff geoffrey murray dunn  dowling  partners securities llc just to break down i think you called out  million of total extraneous costs this quarter can you break down the business reinvestments versus the integration expense and then also the incremental efficiency gains james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc in terms of the saves themselves we included the  million as part of the full year were progressing against that and the way i would look at it amongst the segments its pretty equally distributed between the two segments in corporate and in terms of the investments those are kind of coming along as planned geoffrey murray dunn  dowling  partners securities llc yeah im actually looking for the numbers if you have them was it  million of reinvestment this quarter and  million of integration costs how does it break down how does that  million break down frank d martell  chief operating officer yeah i think you can work with dan on the details i think in terms of roughly just some of those as we kind of articulated in the earnings release relate to areas like compliance and information security that apply broadly across the company id say the biggest chunk that would be specific would be the vsg related which is obviously all probably  of the total would be related to that geoffrey murray dunn  dowling  partners securities llc okay ill follow up with dan the other question i had is on the purchase market im curious it seems like maybe purchase when you strip out hpa is lagging some of the projections that we started off the year whats your sense of the purchase market health going through yearend and into next year refi volatility is going to continue but im curious as to your thoughts on the health of the overall purchase market anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer i think the purchase market is starting to civilize to some extent there is going to be always puts and takes the refi activity thats going to be determined by rates and we dont think – well theres a lot of people are saying that fed is not going to touch the rates but there is also thinking that fed could make a rate change at the end of the year so refis are going to be dependent upon that but we see a solid footing on purchase thats going to only increase with new homes coming in and also single family renters moving into homes geoffrey murray dunn  dowling  partners securities llc are you worried at all with the affordability if rates do start to go up a bit anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer i dont necessarily worry about it i think with the current criteria its pretty tight so if there is anything i dont think its a question of affordability its probably going to be a question of how credit capacity is being viewed by the lenders and regulators so that still has to settle down geoffrey murray dunn  dowling  partners securities llc okay thanks anand operator thank you our next question is from bose george of kbw your line is open chas tyson  keefe bruyette  woods inc hey guys this is actually chas tyson on for bose i just want to ask about vsg and the timing there i know you mentioned that youve assembled the leadership team and done some feedback meetings but maybe if you could give some more color about the timing of introducing the enhanced technology and data to the former rels and landsafe businesses and then potentially maybe think about kind of inorganic growth and expanding your market share significantly frank d martell  chief operating officer chas this is frank thanks for the question yeah so i think weve made tremendous progress at vsg were really happy about assembling a great team and i think weve got a really really strong team which is i think unusual to assemble that so quickly so we feel thats pretty good and will give us a leg up in terms of how quickly we can do things this year its very important that we integrate our appraisal operations we think we have the best service level in the industry today with both rels and the landsafe businesses we want to be able to combine them and keep that level of service or expand it so that can be the biggest focus this year is to make sure that happens so we come out next year and thats where essentially the gates open in terms of organic growth for those two firms we have the biggest staff appraiser panel in the us which is a tremendous competitive advantage so we think that that from an inorganic perspective theres tremendous growth there we want to make sure that were targeted in how we do that obviously theres margin implications etc so we want to make sure that were careful but that is a tremendous opportunity for us if we get that right this year and we feel pretty good about that i think in terms of the synergies we provide – the exciting thing to me is we provide tremendous gradations of property valuation services anything from an avm up to a full property inspection and many points in between so those give our clients a wide array of different solution sets that they can apply to different types of activities within their shop and we can do that under one roof so we think that thats a type activity were working on the it side there to be able to enable that delivery so thats more of a  but its very exciting and the third thing is we operate if not the most important one of the most important valuation industry consortiums working a lot to expand and build on that very important source of insight for our clients the consortium and thats where companies like fnc come in and provide tremendous additional data that can be put through those types of vehicles so those i think will come forward into promise in  but for now really focus on the integration of the appraisal companies assembly of the management team and really  talked about getting the industry constituents – some consensus with the industry constituents in terms of where to focus and what the biggest pain points are et cetera chas tyson  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay and then on fnc i know you had said that there were differences in the client list between what fnc was surveying and what corelogic had been surveying i mean is that a process that you started of shopping that around to clients and can you talk about how conversations are going there and what we should think of from maybe a growth trend on that particular revenue stream frank d martell  chief operating officer well fnc has over a hundred lender clients and those tend to be – theres some large clients but they tend to be more clustered in the mid and what we call the mid mass markets thats an area that weve invested behind the last maybe three to four years to build out our footprint and so its very symbiotic from that standpoint i think where the opportunity lies for us is some of the mid mass market clients that may or may not use some of our other data sets like flood or credit we think we can package through the fnc platform more of our content and that will be again kind of a type because requires some technology and some distribution enablement chas tyson  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay and then just one last one if i could squeeze it in i think you guys passed on march  one of the last dataquick unlocks for customers there to switch off did you guys see any significant customer attrition from that and has that been a factor in property information growth over the last couple years anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer no i think that was just a – i think youre referring to the ftc consenting rate towards helping realty track and that seems going according to plan and i dont think we have had any significant impacts from that its a very minor part of our focus in the market chas tyson  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay thank you very much anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer okay operator thank you our next question is from chris gamaitoni of autonomous research your line is open chris gamaitoni  autonomous research us lp good morning thanks for taking my call on the  billion in annual revenue you mentioned in the appraisal industry is all of that open to you given your current product set and what market share do you currently have anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer its by product what we talked about was the total addressable market thats the  billion out there but we dont certainly cover everything but when it comes to avms we have a pretty large share out there with our own product and also with white label products and private label products out there so there is still opportunity and hard to go about it the front end of the appraisal market is a wide open market thats where everybody – even you can have solutions that control the appraisers desktop and help them to funnel information into an entity like fnc to go into the lenders so there are pockets in areas of growth where we could really address its tough to kind of put a market share out there we are trying to kind of figure out all these things and i think once the integration for vsg is done well have a better feel for what are the big pieces of the market that recover where we want and what we consider to be longer term market share opportunities for us chris gamaitoni  autonomous research us lp okay and then on – just to clarify on the underlying growth rate of  for core products is that constant currency or including fx headwinds that you previously stated anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer thats excluding fx chris gamaitoni  autonomous research us lp so thats constant currency anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer correct chris gamaitoni  autonomous research us lp and in your guidance are you maintaining the same prior outlook for the decline in the dollar i think the  throughout the year frank d martell  chief operating officer yeah weve factored in a modest the fact of the matter is i think the us dollar has – our viewpoint is its kind of trending a little bit stronger i dont think its a material change but its a little bit more of a drag than we thought chris gamaitoni  autonomous research us lp well thanks so much for taking my call anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer thank you frank d martell  chief operating officer thanks operator thank you our next question is from kevin kaczmarek of zelman  associates your line is open kevin kaczmarek  zelman  associates hey thanks guys a number of large lenders notably bank of america pc and fifth third among others have announced major upgrades to their – either their loan origination systems andor mortgage servicing software systems over the past few quarters can you tell us about how your relationship is with some of these lenders and how it changes when a major software and workflow change goes through like this i mean how do you get in there and try to increase the use of your flood credit and data valuation products in that scenario anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer yeah i think as a settlement service provider we have very strong connections with our lenders out there and if they switch software we usually – we work with them and – to write the interfaces and the data maps to include our products in their offerings out there but theres two areas that we work with one is with the lenders themselves would request it if they are switching it from one provider to another and the other area is we also work with the providers out there i think of credit for example its kind of like the de facto standard with any origination system that you would touch so we do try to work with them on placing our products with good placement kevin kaczmarek  zelman  associates okay and if were thinking about maybe some incremental revenue from those opportunities do you have a sense of where you might find it maybe in flood or some valuation products or data anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer as to the extent that its incremental in terms of installation yeah but most of these things if they are switching from one provider to another we are already there kevin kaczmarek  zelman  associates okay all right i think all the rest of my questions have been answered thanks a lot operator thank you our next question is from oscar turner of suntrust your line is open oscar turner  suntrust robinson humphrey inc good morning thanks for taking my questions anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer hi oscar oscar turner  suntrust robinson humphrey inc hi so you mentioned i think in you opening comments that there were some headwinds from lenders reducing spending can you provide more color on the types of products that banks are curtailing spending on because i thought that increased regulation could be somewhat of a longterm tailwind for you guys as lenders reduce the number of vendors anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer yeah i think what that meant was standards in the past couple of years were not established out there and now we are seeing a little bit especially with trid being behind us for a while and some of the other things that they have relationships with whether its cfpb or other regulatory agency they kind of know what is expected of them prior to this lenders had to make their own guess so as they do it there was a lot of information to be gathered about knowing your customer so to speak now they know clear standards have been established so there – that was the shift a little bit i think in the long term there will be tailwinds for us because of all the regulatory impacts because the kind of things that the lenders have to comply with now is a lot more than what they had before and a lot of those things are going to be served by providers such as us oscar turner  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thanks and then i saw that credit inquiries were up  in the quarter but i think credit screening revenue was up lowsingle digit percentage can you just talk about whats driving the lower pricing there frank d martell  chief operating officer yeah oscar i think dan can parse out the – there isnt lower pricing there could be some mix differences because within our credit volumes we have auto and we have a lender so theres some different mix – it could be a mix issue but we have not had a price change or a price decline oscar turner  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thanks operator thank you our next question is from jason deleeuw of piper jaffray your line is open eric m robinson  piper jaffray  co broker yeah thanks guys youve got eric robinson on the line here for jason thanks for taking the call just on the vsg kind of business and that revenue for the quarter is that a fair run rate kind of assuming going forward here and was fnc included for the full quarter frank d martell  chief operating officer no fnc was basically two months of the quarter and id say in terms of a run rate obviously property valuation theres a seasonal characteristic to it so you will typically see a stronger second and third quarter than first and fourth quarters id say that were only beginning so i think theres growth opportunity beyond the volumes that you saw obviously were – primarily our volume is primarily being driven by the rels and the landsafe which are two firms wells fargo and bank of america driven so as i mentioned earlier once we have a broad market offering then obviously the volumes should increase significantly eric m robinson  piper jaffray  co broker got it got it and then just on the vsg margins itself what kind of – or could you talk about the specifics that are needed to improve those vsg margins over time i know that fnc comes on at a higher margin but if we think about the cadence of the margin expansion there what are the specific drivers that could help those margins james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc yeah i think if – to me theres two areas one is on the – theres a data and analytics component to vsg and a platform component thats at margins rates that are higher than our aggregate margin percentages so we obviously want to grow in those areas and that will affect the margin percentage in the right way in terms of the volumes that relate to property appraisal we think that we can from a process perspective improve cycle times and reduce the inefficiencies in the process thereby improving the margins and then also realize the benefits of scale very similar to what we did in flood credit and tax over the last three or four years is to scale up and drive efficiency and automation so we think – we talked about this before we think the margin rates in the aggregate for vsg shouldnt look a whole lot different than the total company margin rates once the full platform is built out eric m robinson  piper jaffray  co broker and then you think that would take a coupleyear timeline here is that the right framework to think about or  frank d martell  chief operating officer yeah itll take two three years i think to really come to full realization obviously were going to make progress along the way fnc is a highmargin company obviously our data analytics are high margin so from that perspective we have a lot of highmargin assets already in the portfolio and as anand mentioned if we look at the ma landscape that would be a nice area to tack on some capabilities eric m robinson  piper jaffray  co broker got it all right thanks for taking my questions james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc thank you operator thank you our last question is from the line of glenn greene of oppenheimer your line is open glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker thanks good morning thanks for squeezing me in a few number questions i guess the first one just sort of thinking of the q ebitda you sort of talked about it being roughly in line with q to maybe modestly up most of the mortgage forecasts at this point are actually up sequentially q versus q and i would think that the  million of sort of onetime costs you had this quarter would moderate so i guess what im getting at is that q seems awfully conservative or im missing something frank d martell  chief operating officer yeah i think if you look at the certainly the mba quarterly forecast i hate to get that granular but its really – i think its – theyre calling very – essentially a flat quarterly viewpoint so hopefully its better than that but i think theyre talking about  versus like  so its pretty – and then a lot of thats price and so i dont think theres going to be a huge upswing i think some of that depends on your point of view about refi and how long the refi activity is going to be elevated because of the brexit and all that kind of stuff but as anand said were not counting on that to necessarily drive a lot of upside in the third quarter james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc yeah and just to add to franks comments were going to have integration costs associated with fnc but also well have some real estate costs as a result of our productivity program there as were consolidating footprints that well hit in the second half of the year glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker so as it relates to that i think when we entered the year we were talking about the  million to  million of vsg sort of onetime costs and there was another  million of costs related to the savings program and it seems like at least yeartodate youre through that but now youre talking about incremental costs so there are additional onetime costs or whats the magnitude of the onetime costs above what you talked about entering the year frank d martell  chief operating officer no i dont think theyre onetime costs glenn i think the costs we talked about are things like compliance infosec and i think those – every – were in the same boat probably more or so than our competitors because of our scale we have to invest in ongoing and compliance and i think thats a strength i think one of the discussions earlier was about compliance and the regulatory environment i think its our strength and clearly weve benefited for the last couple of years its like the quality where people are looking at quality vendors and were certainly one of them so we have to invest in those areas i dont think those are onetime glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay frank d martell  chief operating officer the integration stuff is lumpier in onetime but the infosec that kind of stuff is a cost of doing business there may be a quarter thats a little heavier than others but thats kind of an ongoing in my opinion glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay and then just to frame it relative to the  you sort of called out the organic growth for the core products the  as weve looked at the back half is there a way to think directionally about some more organic growth parameters for pi and rmw how should we be thinking about that frank d martell  chief operating officer yeah well we are focused significantly on raising that growth rate as i mentioned we have a lot of levers to do it so were going to fight like nobodys business to get those growth rates up in the second half of the year and i think we had a pretty good selling season towards the back half of the second quarter which gives us some confidence level but its a little bit of uncertain times and on it are a list of people are – i think we lose track of the fact that a lot of our clients are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the regulatory environment and thats sapping in their ability to look at proactive and other spending areas that traditionally they would have done so – but i think having said all that we have a good product array coming out in the market we have good traction on our new products and we think that growth rate should come up well prove that over the second half of the year glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker and just one more ill just squeeze in but the bridge to the  change in eps i guess something like   of it is the ebitda change and i guess the balance is the refinancing james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc yeah thats reasonable its about  to  glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay great thanks a lot guys james l balas  chief financial officer corelogic inc thank you operator thank you im not showing any further questions ladies and gentlemen thank you for

corelogics fourth quarter earnings call i will lead off the call today with a recap of our  operating results as well as strategic areas of focus for  frank will summarize fourth quarter financial results and discuss  guidance before we go to qa corelogic delivered very strong results in  for the year revenues operating income and net income free cash flow and eps grew significantly and were all at record levels we exceeded our financial targets and outperformed the market volumes in our core mortgage related operations importantly we also continued to make progress with regards to our strategic business plan which has been our guide over the past five years as i have outlined on past calls we are focused on a strategic program which includes the following four imperatives one achieving market leadership in our core property intelligence underwriting and risk management solutions businesses two driving operating leverage and expanding margins through process reengineering workflow optimization and cost efficiency three optimizing our existing technology infrastructure and launching the corelogic innovation center and our gen platform and four building financial flexibility and consistently returning capital to our shareholders corelogic celebrated its fifth anniversary as a publiclytraded company in  over the past five years during a period of rapid change and unprecedented market headwinds we transformed our company into a global leader providing must have datadriven property insight to an expanding bluechip client base we invested to build high operating leverage in our core business units and fostered technology leadership and innovation we have also improved our quality and service by driving significant operating efficiencies over the past five years we have delivered consistent growth in revenues profits and cash flow specifically since  we grew revenues at a compounded rate of  adjusted ebitda by  and adjusted eps by  at the same time we prudently invested in our business for longterm growth and returned more than  million in capital to our shareholders today our core solutions truly sit at the heart of the global housing ecosystem our ability to consistently grow revenues in areas where we can secure market leadership and scale has been one of the keys to our success over the past five years we have transformed the mix of our business to highlight data analytics and dataenabled solutions that help our clients address critical underwriting and risk management activities this business mix has also helped us to improve profitability and increase free cash flow as i mentioned earlier corelogic delivered record operating results in  revenues were up  operating income from continuing operations was up  adjusted ebitda was up  and adjusted eps was up  revenue in  totaled  billion reported revenues grew  in our property intelligence segment on a constant currency basis property intelligence grew  our risk management and work flow segment grew  fueled by higher market volumes pricing and share gains adjusted ebitda was up  to  million in  this increase was largely the result of revenue growth and the benefits of productivity which more than offset investments in innovation technology and ongoing cost management programs our strong financial results in  reflect the strength of our business model we are entering  with a clear pathway to sustain growth our unique products and solutions help our clients to more precisely underwrite and manage their risks and capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise one of the ways we are continuing to drive market leadership is through the realignment of our company to effectively address the current and emerging strategic regulatory and marketbased needs of our clients our press release yesterday outlines our updated operating segmentation which we believe aligns with the evolving ways that our clients source and consume property information and data enabled workflow services in line with our strategic objective of providing scaled and data enabled solutions we launched the valuation solution group or vsg in the fourth quarter of  over  billion is spent annually on residential property valuation this area remains one of several underwriting and risk management activities in the property ecosystem that we believe would benefit from enhanced technology and the application of data and analytics the vsg will provide a comprehensive array of property valuation and collateral assessment solutions and the technology platforms that connect market participants with supply chain service providers the opportunity to transform the way assets in a real estate transaction are valued and to bring greater transparency to the process makes this a significant medium and longterm growth opportunity for us we acquired landsafe appraisal services and full ownership of rels valuation in a second half of  these businesses provide real estate asset valuation and appraisal solutions in december  we also entered into an agreement to acquire fnc a leading provider of real estate collateral information technology and solutions that automate property appraisal workflows the fnc transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions the combination of landsafe rels and fnc together with corelogics existing property intelligence assets provide the foundational elements of a scaled integrated solutions provider powered by a broad suite of fulfillment platform data and analytics capabilities completing the integration of our capabilities and realizing the full potential of the vsg will be a significant multiyear endeavor but we believe the opportunities for our firm and the industry could be transformative in many ways the creation of the vsg demonstrates the power and opportunities resident in the increasing integration of corelogics data analytical tools domain expertise and technological capabilities the us mortgage market is continuing to transition to a purchasedriven cycle with market fundamentals improving purchase volumes are gathering steam and should help to at least partially offset the expected drop in refinancing activity in  with sustainable job creation and overall economic recovery we expect to see healthier housing starts and inventory levels over time overall we believe this transition has set the stage for a more sustainable realestate market for this year and beyond in closing corelogic delivered record operating results in  i believe our strong performance demonstrates the benefits and value creation opportunities inherent in our strategic plan we are deeply embedded in our clients critical works flows our scale and ability to invest in the vsg and other unique solution sets compliance automation and dataenabled services as well as our reputation for delivering a high level of quality and service has made us a preferred partner for businesses and government agencies with a need for property intelligence and insights i want to thank our employees clients and shareholders for their continued support as always our focus remains squarely on strong operational execution and positioning corelogic for a superior longterm growth and stakeholder value creation with that ill turn it over to frank frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer thank you anand good morning everyone today im going to recap our fourth quarter  financial results and provide some additional color around our cost management programs and  guidance as anand mentioned earlier  was an outstanding year for corelogic operationally we continue to shift our business mix towards datadriven subscription based models built around scaled industry currency solutions the strength of our business model and free cash flow profile allows us to invest in product and service innovation and operational improvements at the same time we have a wellestablished track record of returning significant capital to our shareholders and managing our debt balances over the past year we strengthened our client engagement further integrated and streamlined our organizational structure and drove significant cost efficiencies we also enhanced our technology leadership by ramping up the corelogic innovation center and completing the multiyear transition of our it infrastructure to a managed service provider from a financial point of view our  full year revenues operating and net income free cash flow and eps were significantly above prior year levels and exceeded our financial targets we drove up adjusted ebitda margins by more than  basis points to  while investing in our product and service development compliance and it capabilities we converted  of our adjusted ebitda to free cash flow and returned  of that to our shareholders by repurchasing almost  of our common shares since  we have reduced our outstanding share count by  with regard to the fourth quarter of  financial highlights include the following first topline gains in each of our operating segments with accelerating organic growth trends in property intelligence second market outperformance in risk management work flow third the successful launch of the vsg including the acquisitions of landsafe and rels and the pending acquisition of fnc and fourth and finally the completion of our cost management program fourth quarter revenues totaled  million  higher than prior year as market share gains organic growth and acquisition related revenues more than offset unfavorable fx translation property intelligence or pi segment revenues rose  to  million fueled by growth in insurance spatial solutions international and core property data as well as the launch of the vsg which collectively were partially offset by fx pi organic growth rates accelerated in q resulting in a full year  growth rate of approximately  vsg revenues in the fourth quarter were  million benefits from market share and pricing gains drove risk management and work flow or rmw segment revenues up  yearoveryear to  million despite modestly lower us mortgage loan application volumes the impact of reduced document processing and retrieval revenues and the planned runoff of a noncore credit reporting service operating income from continuing operations totaled  million for the quarter compared with  million in  as benefits from revenue gains and productivity were offset by onetime expenses related to vsg launch and cost reduction programs which aggregated  million before the effect of these items corelogic operating income from continuing operations increased by approximately  million or  fourth quarter net income from continuing operations totaled  million compared to  million in the same  period the  million yearoveryear increase was driven primarily by operating upsides and a  million after tax gain on investments associated with the rels acquisition which were partially offset by higher tax provisions unfavorable fx translation and costs associated with the launch of vsg and efficiency programs adjusted diluted eps totaled  up  yearoveryear reflecting the positive impacts of growth expense efficiencies and share repurchases diluted eps from continuing operations totaled  compared with  in q of  adjusted ebitda totaled  million in the fourth quarter compared with  million last year the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily the result of revenue growth and benefits of expense reduction programs which were partially offset by costs attributable to the vsg launch ongoing productivity actions and unfavorable fx pi segment adjusted ebitda totaled  million for the quarter compared with  million in  adjusted ebitda was modestly higher than prior year on a local currency basis during the quarter the benefit of higher revenues funded investments in efficiency innovations of vsg rmw adjusted ebitda was  million consistent with the same prior year period as the benefits of share gains in tax flood and credit services and improved pricing were offset by onetime cost efficiency programs lower document processing and retrieval revenues and the runoff of a noncore credit reporting service fourth quarter  adjusted ebitda margin was  compared with  in the prior year fourth quarter  ebitda margin was negatively impacted by approximately  basis points due to the investments in efficiency innovation of the vsg which i discussed earlier i will focus the balance of my remarks today on cost management and  guidance as our longterm shareholders know our commitment to a rigorous and ongoing focus on productivity margin expansion has been an integral part of our growth and success earlier in  we announced a program designed to lower run rate expenses by  million exiting  savings are expected to be realized with the consolidation facilities reduction in sga cost outsourcing of certain business activities and other operational improvements im pleased to report today that we achieved our  million in  savings and we are on track to generate additional savings of  million and  million in  and  respectively in terms of financial guidance for  we announced on january  we expect to generate revenues of between  billion and  billion adjusted ebitda of  million to  million and adjusted eps of  to  each range incorporates significant increases in  actual results our guidance is based on the following main assumptions first us mortgage loan origination unit volumes are down  from  second targeted cost savings at least  million third the successful integration of landsafe and rels with integration costs expected to total  million to  million fourth the completion of the fnc acquisition by march  fifth us dollar appreciation against the australian and new zealand dollars and the euro of approximately  and finally the opportunistic repurchases of common shares and the management of our net debt to adjusted ebitda in line with our longterm targets our long stated capital allocation strategy remains in place we will continue to reinvest in product and service development productivity and cost management programs and well opportunistically repurchase common shares and retire outstanding debt in terms of the first quarter of  based on seasonality in our currency origination unit volumes we believe that adjusted ebitda should be modestly above first quarter  levels this favorable yearoveryear performance includes the absorption of significant onetime costs associated with the vsg launch and ongoing cost productivity programs to sum it up  was another outstanding year for corelogic strategically operationally and financially as we enter into  our scaled and unique datadriven underwriting and risk management solutions are our platforms for sustained growth and market leadership thank you for your time today ill now turn the call back over to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instruction our first question comes from the line of darrin peller with barclays your line is open please go ahead darrin peller  barclays capital inc thanks guys looking just on the year just look at  going forward when you think of the valuation solutions group that youve put together your initiatives and some of the deals youve done  what kind of growth profile should this business have correlated is that business actually to originations versus some of your others that  may be a little less so and what is – in terms of color on the strategy longer term around  how big that could be thanks frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer darrin this is frank you broke up a little bit but ill try to answer your question and please add if i dont as anand mentioned this is an enormous space its over  billion annually we look at this as a multivertical opportunity not just mortgage although mortgage is obviously a significant portion of that as anand mentioned we look at this as a significant growth engine for the company in the next several years i think the growth rates could be very very significant even though through the acquisition of fnc landsafe and rels in addition to our existing capabilities we already have a very significant amount of revenue related to property evaluation and assessment in both the financial services and the insurance vertical ill say as well as i think public sector so its a big opportunity a high growth opportunity as anand mentioned i think the other thing is we do – it will take a couple of years to fully mature were going out at bringing data and analytics which we think will hopefully transform the way property valuation is done over time so its a big opportunity big revenue opportunity and i think a big strategic opportunity for the company across many verticals darrin peller  barclays capital inc okay i guess when we look at the underlying growth for  i think its comforting for a lot of investors to see that youre including a conservative assumption of like a  drop off in originations can you just give us maybe in a different way to look at how youre approaching a flattish type growth rate in ebitda how much of that actually is from cost versus growth and where the growth initiatives are like where we would expect to see growth in the other parts of your business on the topline frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah so i think first of all – i think broadly speaking at this point origination volumes its fairly unclear starting off the year i think were seeing some positive signals in terms of rates not being quite as high as i think initially forecast but youre also seeing some weather and some other offset so we want to make sure as we have in the past years that were not over shooting from a market projection perspective darrin peller  barclays capital inc right makes sense frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer i think in terms of growth we still see a lot of growth in insurance spatial has been a good growth on a local currency strong growth in international so were riding a number of different horses in the pi segment theres a lot of organic growth as well as it relates to valuations things like our lsam product which has been adopted widely across the industry in the valuation space so were seeing some good growth there we did see acceleration as i mentioned in the organic growth rate in the fourth quarter in pi that was a big topic on our third quarter call we did see a pick up there we exited the year in the fourth year just under  and for the year a little bit under  so that was a pretty good performance coming out of the year so we expect that kind of performance level to continue as we go forward so i think theres a lot of different growth drivers there clearly cost management is going to help us to absorb any downside related to the volumes as they appear i think we feel like were really on solid ground to get the  million that we committed to last year and so thats i think a very good insurance policy as well darrin peller  barclays capital inc okay all right thanks last question – go ahead anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer just add to that darrin on the strategy on vsg we believe that there is a ton of things that are in our favor the last time when we got out of being a direct appraisal management company there wasnt any way to limit the exposure to liabilities standards were loose and the level of automation to bring transparency into the process wasnt valued as much and with we have seen with our automated valuation models and the growth in loansafe appraisal manager and the increased sign up and growth of industry leaders in the appraisal consortium that we run along with the insurance vertical we believe that there is enough opportunities to grow even outside of the entities that we have that were bringing in to the vsg valuation today is at the center of mortgage performance along with borrower qualification regulatory controls are strict to warrant transparency into the process there is a lot more consistency in the valuation methodology we see that in the need for thats consistently coming up in the appraisal consortiums and the availability of comprehensive data and analytics to assess risk especially replacement cost data and spatial solutions those are all the things that made us feel very confident about vsg darrin peller  barclays capital inc okay all right thats helpful just last quick question for a little more maintenance fees  on the free cash flow conversion i think you were right around  is there anything – i mean i know you guys consistently have said like  to  more or less youve also said thats going to potentially improve over time anything changing or anything unusual about the last years free cash conversion that we should – that couldnt recur in terms of converting from ebitda at that rate frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah i think there was one anomaly that accounted for about  million of benefit in last year so if you normalize were still in the low s darrin peller  barclays capital inc okay frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer and thats been pretty consistent darrin peller  barclays capital inc and thats what we should expect frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer now obviously i think as we talked about the other thing is  i think the mix is progressively improving our cash generative nature over time for sure darrin peller  barclays capital inc all right all right very helpful guys thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bose george with kbw your line is open please go ahead chas tyson  keefe bruyette  woods inc hey guys this is actually chas tyson on for bose i just wanted to ask on the vsg opportunity is that an opportunity that you feel like you can generate a lot of scale in i mean theres kind of a fair amount of fixed cost to scale out over or is it probably going to be pretty consistently a  to  ebitda margin type of business anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer we believe that the scale could be improved and i also think that the margin profile could also be improved what we are talking about the numbers that youre saying are the traditional percentages and one of the things that we kind of outlined and thats one of the reasons we say its going to be a multiyear effort is to kind of move that needle up as we bring in more data and more analytics into the whole process chas tyson  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay and is that due to kind of what youve done on some of the risk management work flow businesses where you automate the business a little more and maybe take some of the higher cost aspects out of it anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer automation plays a role but i think data plays a bigger role and analytics will pay a bigger role in it up until now like we talked about the replacement cost data and spatial data were not part of it they were disjointed and what we are pegging on is to bring all of these solutions into an integrated way and fnc like we said is still in process fnc is the network utility that kind of actually connects it with the technology stacks of the consuming lenders chas tyson  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay and then on the insurance and spatial revenue line i know that had been trending kind of in the high doubledigit yearoveryear growth range can you just maybe help us out with how that grew in the fourth quarter and how you guys see that growing over  frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah so in terms of the underwriting slightly lower growth weve had good growth internationally and with our spatial solutions unit and then kind of a lower growth rate on the core underwriting business that its a traditional business that we acquired from msb a couple of years ago but overall the combined growth rate was very strong this year and i think we expect that to come back a little bit that and puts into our guidance in  to a more normalized level in the midsingledigits with spatial probably growing more in the low doubledigits as we go forward spatial is roughly half of that revenue stream so youll have a blend – the blended should be in the upper singledigits chas tyson  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay should we think that the fourth quarter was kind of close to that uppersingle digits metric frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah it was a little bit higher actually we traditionally – theres some timing always to the yearend with some data sales et cetera but it was slightly higher than the numbers i just gave you chas tyson  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay thank you very much guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of glenn greene with oppenheimer your line is open please go ahead glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker thank you good morning maybe if we could just come back to vsg a little bit a lot of moving parts embedded in your fiscal  guide including the rels landsafe and then fnc but maybe so we can get a better sense for the organic growth contribution could you give us a sense for the aggregate revenue contribution for the vsg components that youre sort of thinking about going into fiscal  and then i have got a couple of followups frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah glenn this is frank i mean obviously the vast majority of the vsg revenue is going to be coming through the acquisitions that anand mentioned we do have a fairly significant amount of data and analytics related valuation solutions that are growing i think in kind of an upper single digit growth rate through  which we would expect to continue in  so id say for the organic growth element of vsg its in that uppersingle digits in  and its very significant revenue obviously contributed by the vsg the focus is on the integration of landsafe and rels which are appraisalfocused i think there is a lot of synergy there there is a lot of integration and efficiency and operating leverage there because youre bringing two fairly significant players with established panels together so you can imagine the synergy there obviously we need to make sure that thats done very very carefully so theres no disruption in service and then in terms of fnc as anand mentioned i think the major assumption at this moment is the closure by the end of the first quarter thats obviously beyond our direct control its regulatory and normal closing conditions that have to be assumed but assuming that closes as anand mentioned thats a tremendous – the important platform in the industry and a tremendously sticky high margin business which makes our content that much more consumable within the industry that firm has over  lenders on their platform so that gives the great distribution channel for other products beyond even vsg so were excited about that so i think those are the major moving parts of vsg very very high obviously inorganic growth i think reasonably high organic growth through primarily the analytical piece within corelogic thats in the pi segment glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker thats helpful let me try this another way if we think about the pi and rmw segments at this point it sounds like pi was close to  organic in  is that a reasonable expectation ex the acquisitions and for rmw im kind of thinking lowsingledigit organic ex sort of macro factors and fx are those kind of reasonable expectations frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah id say we were about  in pi nonvsg id say thats a reasonably good assumption for  based on the assumptions i gave you in terms of the market et cetera and then i think your other assumptions fine glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker and then just one quick followup youre obviously spending i think it was  million or  million on integration related to vsg with the idea that theres some efficiencies and cost savings attached to that which my guess is youre going to start to realize and recognize in fiscal  is there a way to frame kind of the saving opportunity going into  frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer that really is going to be in the run rate glenn so i think as we guide for  it will be an all included number most of what were spending on vsg is integration and transactional related so as we guide i think those numbers will be inside the guidance numbers for  glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay all right thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jason deleeuw with piper jaffray your line is open please go ahead jason s deleeuw  piper jaffray  co broker thank you so a question on vsg with the competitors that you will be going up against is it mostly inhouse or are there other larger competitors or is it fragmented and just talk about how vsg will be differentiated versus those other solutions frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah i think as anand mentioned – ill let anand – theres nobody that looks like the corelogic offering today in terms of breadth and depth the data elements of it were trying to bring something very unique to the market through the infusion of data and analytics which we think is very unique therere many many many players in property valuation its a very fragmented space we see the opportunity there in terms of creating something scale so i think this is quite different and the opportunity is quite different were not going in this to be another small player in appraisal so i think its quite unique actually anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer this is anand jason i think the path to the future in vsg will be very similar to what happened in past you had a few inhouse and a big provider like us and then there was a highly fragmented industry and you see that fragmentation being consolidated because the regulatory controls are such that they want the products and the service to be provided by bankable  providers and the lenders want the same thing and we see the same thing happening in vsg as you saw with the landsafe and with rels these were captives and we have had a lot of captives in our njv that we have operated from before and we see that being unlocked and getting over to a situation like vsg and we see that trend growing jason s deleeuw  piper jaffray  co broker thanks thats very helpful and then a question on  guidance and thinking about it by segment just given the assumption that youre going to have the unit origination volumes down  should we think then for rmw that revenue and ebitda should be down on the year just given that assumption and then youre going to have some organic growth from the pi segment and then the acquisition benefit in pi is that the right way to kind of think about the segments for the year frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer obviously we dont really guide by segment but i wouldnt say thats necessarily the case obviously the growth rates which had been very strong last couple of years despite mortgage market fluctuations in rmw that will not necessarily be negative we had some positive factors related to share gains coming through that were secured in  pricing et cetera so there are some offsets there it may not be as robust as its been in past years but certainly i think its not necessarily a negative jason s deleeuw  piper jaffray  co broker okay great thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris gamaitoni with autonomous research your line is open please go ahead chris gamaitoni  autonomous research us lp hi thanks for taking my call the ish million step up quarteroverquarter in the vsg line was that just landsafe or is cordell in there as well frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah cordell is not a vsg thats landsafe chris gamaitoni  autonomous research us lp what is cordell frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer cordell is actually – its a property information company small company in australia chris gamaitoni  autonomous research us lp okay and then can you give us any indication of kind of the margin of the vsg business is it similar to pi will it be lower to start and then grow over time ex the charges im just trying to understand the ebitda margin kind of outlook for the pi business frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah i think as anand mentioned its going to be lower than the aggregate margin of traditional margin of pi in the short run but we expect that to be on a trajectory to come closer to that margin rate over the next couple of years through scale leverage et cetera anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer new products frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer and the mix of the revenue which in  will be skewed more towards the traditional appraisal work and then because obviously things like fnc which is just partial year so the richer mix of higher margin businesses will be more on display in  as we see the full build out come into play chris gamaitoni  autonomous research us lp and the timing of – think you had mentioned in the first quarter there is going to be more of the cost related to the cost efficiencies in vsg can you give us like a split of what percentage of all that will fall into the first quarter and kind of in throughout the year just a rough sense frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yes so clearly the heavier expenditure is going to be in the first half of the year were trying to get as much done as we possibly can early as possible the challenge is more on the vsg side because we need to – we have client consideration and other things to make sure that were doing the right thing so thats a little bit a slower but on the cost programs et cetera were trying to go as quickly as we can so the skew is more in the first half of the year than the second half chris gamaitoni  autonomous research us lp perfect thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john campbell with stephens inc your line is open please go ahead hayden blair  stephens inc hey guys this is actually hayden sitting in for john im curious once vsg is ramped up a bit can you help us frame up maybe some new kind of sensitivity analysis related to mortgage originations with that addition and with the segment realignment and that would be helpful either on a segment level or maybe just a total company level as well frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer sure we can do that i think we wont have time on this call but i think well provide that as we move forward hayden blair  stephens inc got it and then real quickly here are there any other large lenders like bank of america that you can think you can win on the vsg front i mean were those bac and wells deals kind of part of a larger trend in outsourcing these or were those kind of oneoff deals talking only about kind of the top five or top  lenders frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer bank of america is in the vsg through the landsafe appraisal services but to go back to the second part of your question i believe so i think you see a lot of trend towards consolidated service providers and integrated service providers who can bring a lot to the table especially like i said in my commentary that the valuation is now center of the mortgage performance along with borrower qualification you got to get that thing right and so theres a heightened need to make sure that they look at all the data the lenders look at all the data as possible to take that value right and also theres – regulatory controls are strict enough to warrant a heavy amount of transparency into the process which are all things that we could help especially major lenders hayden blair  stephens inc great thanks for the questions operator thank you your next question comes from the line of kevin mcveigh from macquarie your line is open please go ahead kevin mcveigh  macquarie capital usa inc great thank you hey has there been any kind of meaningful change in tone or anything obviously real nice job on the positive preannouncement but fast forward to today anything kind of changed in the last six weeks or so or was it always going to be the assumption that originations were down  or is that up from down  frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer no nothing has changed same as what we released on the th kevin mcveigh  macquarie capital usa inc okay and then just – as you think longerterm how should we think about margin progression particularly given whats been a nice strategic shift towards the vsg what does that do to the margin profile of the business and is there a way to kind of frame is it – what are you targeting from a margin perspective frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah we still believe kevin that a longterm margin trajectory in the  is achievable clearly in the short run well have a lot more dollars of profit margin percentages will likely be a little bit more challenging in the short run because youre adding a fair amount of revenue in the integration et cetera in  but were doing a lot of the cost structure we still think theres efficiency as anand mentioned i think the longterm margin profile for vsg should be positive so were still convinced that the longterm target of above  makes sense for the mix of the company as it evolves i think in the short run we just need to work hard to offset the integration in bringing vsg to the realization of its potential which obviously we have the plan that we just talked about to do that kevin mcveigh  macquarie capital usa inc thank you operator thank you frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer just to round out the margin answer one of the things that were looking at and were happy with vsg is we know that its going to take a while to kind of get the margins to where we are happy with but one of the other characteristics that were seeing increasing at corelogic is that all of these businesses that were now gathering and getting into and increasing in size and scale are heavy cash flow businesses and thats a positive thing for us going into the future operator thank you our next question comes from the line of keane mccarthy with william blair your line is open please go ahead keane j mccarthy  william blair  co llc hi guys thanks how are you viewing tread  are you viewing it as positive or negative for your guys as volumes and then i know its still early with the roll out being in october of last year but are you seeing customers rely less more on the data that you provide anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer we dont see much of a change i would just say its just a new process and we offered it as part of our solutions because its needed from a mortgage technology solutions perspective but we dont see any drastic changes to influx or any change at all keane j mccarthy  william blair  co llc okay and then i guess with respect to the vsg segment how does the rollout of tread  impact it if at all in terms of the documentation or importance that lenders and third parties are putting on kind of the valuation and appraisal side of the closing anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer i dont think its dramatically impacting anything if at all what were talking about is to pack that process with more analytics more frontend things frank just mentioned about the increased adoption of loansafe appraisal manager which kind of tells us that they want to get the intelligence further up the process thats the only main difference that we have seen keane j mccarthy  william blair  co llc okay and then final one with the techenabled network of appraisers that sounds like a few years away for the vsg it seems like a pretty good opportunity and interesting just curious is there anything like that in the market right now and if theres any competitive whats that like that and then how would the lenders work with the thirdparty providers on that network thanks anand k nallathambi  president and chief executive officer fnc is a major foundational step towards that and on top of it youre talking about all the spatial and environmental data that we can bring in in terms of a risk management perspective and analytics would be a unique thing in the marketplace but from a techenabled network fnc is already well on its way but like we mentioned we want to caution that its still in process for the regulatory approval and customary closing conditions frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah id say keane just one other point to anands theres a tremendous demand for insight and data validation and accuracy and improvement in cycle times in the property valuation space which all plays right down into corelogics wheelhouse so from that perspective we think this is going to be an area that just is perfect for the integration of corelogics data analytics and dataenabled workflow platforms because we have we believe the most comprehensive data out there nobody can match that that we know of in the marketplace today the breadth of analytics so i think the vsg sets up very well according to strategic elements and anand talked about scale data enablement operating leverage et cetera so i think its going to be a – vsg is going to drive demand for corelogic data and solutions because its such a pain point for the industry right now in terms of getting properties valued quickly and accurately keane j mccarthy  william blair  co llc okay thats helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff meuler with robert w baird your line is open please go ahead nick j nikitas  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah thanks this is nick nikitas on for jeff it might be tough given the realignment but any color you guys can provide on how the legacy da organic performance would have been in the quarter i know you mentioned pi rebounded but just given the deceleration last quarter wondering from an industry perspective if youre seeing anything different frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah so the da segment i think i referred to it in my presentation but the da segment more or less pretty close to apples and apples it was up about  in the fourth quarter which was an acceleration of the third quarter when we finished the year the da number was about  for the full year so we did clearly see a reacceleration of that organic growth profile nick j nikitas  robert w baird  co inc broker okay great thanks and just circling back to the mortgage market expectations that are baked in the guidance i think the mba is forecasting about a  decline so is it kind of fair to say that your outlook is something similar as well as the interest rate outlook for  and then just adding on some price increases to that frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah id say that we look at the mba id say its pretty good proxy i mean its early days obviously but the market was better in  obviously then we are going into – people thought going into  hopefully that can be the case in  but its kind of early days nick j nikitas  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thanks for taking the questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex veytsman with monness crespi hardt  co your line is open please go ahead alexander veytsman  monness crespi hardt  co inc yes hi good morning guys could you give a little more color around the share gains with the rmw business during the fourth quarter and what we can potentially expect for  frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah i think alex the share gains were similar to what theyve been theyve been concentrated in tax and flood but i think increasingly in credit as well i think its a combination of factors that continue to spur that on i think anand mentioned flight to quality i mean the compliance area has been one that over the last couple of years benefited corelogic because of our scale and our investment in our compliance infrastructure and i think it continues to favor bigger and more robust suppliers we are a strategic partner for a lot of clients so thats where a lot of the share gains have come we continue to focus – and thats been a lot of spending on efficiency cycle time quality and thats clearly borne fruit there but a pretty good distribution we had very significant share gains in the early part of the year on tax those will flow through in a full year effect in  so that all looks pretty good for our rmw and allows us to outperform the overall market trends in  alexander veytsman  monness crespi hardt  co inc great that helps thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of oscar turner with suntrust your line is open please go ahead oscar turner  suntrust robinson humphrey inc good morning thanks for taking my question in the past youve spoken about the goal of bringing your mortgage market exposure down to the  to  range over the longterm i was just wondering does the company still maintain this target and what is your mortgage exposure for  taking into account these recent acquisitions frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah so our mortgage exposure and frankly weve reduced it through growth and we talk about that percentage as us mortgage exposure so weve grown from – we used to be about  us mortgage related that dropped back to about  through a combination of really growth in insurance spatial solutions international et cetera with vsg clearly thats going to add back some exposure to the us mortgage market but really from our perspective since were starting from a base of zero and we think this is such a large fragmented consolidation opportunity i think that additional exposure is actually pretty good because we can do it in a different way at a higher margin and i think with components like fnc where you have a fairly sticky platformtype industry utility its much more uniform in terms of volume expectations so i think its clearly its going go up i dont have an exact figure but its clearly going to go up from  i dont think thats a bad thing frankly given the opportunity the transformative opportunity this is a very very large transformative opportunity in our opinion and so i think that additional exposure is worth taking on as we move forward oscar turner  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks and can you provide any color on how each of the acquired businesses performed during the past periods of mortgage and market volatility and i completely understand your point about it being a possibly transformative opportunity frank d martell  chief operating officer and chief financial officer yeah i would say that i think as was discussed earlier so obviously landsafe and rels are essentially one client operation so they would mirror the outcomes of bank of america and wells fargo obviously wells fargo has had tremendous success in the mortgage area for many many years so both landsafe and rels have been successful in their own right supporting those clients so the relative success would mirror the success of those two end customers in the market i think in case of fnc its a much more distributed client base and i think you see a much more consistent performance in spite of the vicissitudes of the other mortgage market although clearly obviously there is some impact but its not really correlated and obviously we talk about that there is a tremendous opportunity as it relates to additional clients particularly as it relates to the appraisal area because were starting out with concentration of two clients and that we expect that we will be able to grow the thirdparty revenue oscar turner  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you operator thank you and that does
