numerous illus  maps notes bibliog glossary index operation market garden the bold allied attempt in  to seize three major river crossings including the bridge over the rhine at arnhem remains one of the most controversial operations of the twentieth century thus it is no surprise that it has been extensively written up by historians and soldiers alike of the many published accounts none has been more widely acclaimed than the devils birthday first published in  and it is no coincidence that its author colonel geoffrey powell mc is both a distinguished historian and a veteran of the battlethe operation may have failed but the feats of arms by the three airborne divisions involved the us rd and st and the british st airborne were and will forever remain legendary the contribution of the dutch civilians too was as this book describes truly remarkable as was the great gallantry of the polish troops involved the germans also emerge with credit there was considerable mutual respect born from the bitter fightingas well as being a graphic and accurate account of the action the devils birthday pulls no punches in describing how overambitious and flawed planning interallied rivalry human
