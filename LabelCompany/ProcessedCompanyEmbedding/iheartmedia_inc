syndicated by iheartmedia see also premiere networks iheartmedia operates the countrys largest syndication service premiere networks in addition iheartmedia syndicates a number of its homegrown talk and music shows without the aid of premiere while premiere actively sells its shows to stations the nonpremiere syndicated shows are often used as a costcutting measure and do not have a large sales staff those shows also do not carry networkwide advertising unless distributed by a third party and allow the affiliates to keep all local spots which increases their appeal these networks carry many program hosts of various political ideologies and distribute a variety of programs to both iheartmediaowned and noniheartmediaowned stations in addition to its own syndication network iheartmedia offers studio space and other services to the weststar talkradio network which is based at iheartmedias studios in phoenix arizona as a result many weststar programs are heard on iheartmedia stations not all programming heard on iheartmedias radio stations are produced in house however most of iheartmedias stations share many similarities to each other in branding and programming format lab and hd formatsedit main article iheartradio the format lab is a think tank run by iheartmedia that produces over eighty channels of programming varying from mainstream formats to the highly experimental these channels are heard on most of iheartmedias hd radio subchannels on its stations across the country in a commercialfree format only a few iheartmedia stations such as kgbfm produce locally originated hd channels usually tape loops of programming heard on their regular channel iheartradioedit main article iheartradio iheartradio is an social media site that serves as an outlet for local

 in atlanta or alt alt  in los angeles alt  in st louis and alt  in des moines others include the edge the buzz the project or x their flagship premium choice alternative station is the alternative project broadcasting on waxqfm  hd in new york city urban urban ac and rhythmic stationsedit stations that carry programming catering to black americans are a big part of many iheartmedia clusters particularly philadelphia chicago and detroit in many clusters iheartmedia has two or more such stations about half the urban stations focus on rap and hip hop along with younger rhythm and blues sounds the other half blend some younger rhythm and blues along with some soul from the s s and s along with some current product some of the hip hopbased urban stations report as rhythmic top  stations rather than urban stations because these stations also have some appeal to white and hispanic listeners in a cluster with multiple urban stations owned by iheartmedia one is focused on rap while the other is focused on soul examples include philadelphia with wusls focus on hip hop while wdasfm focuses on soul in addition the company also owns a rhythmic ac station in that area which is wisx  and chicago where wgcifm focuses on rap while wvaz is focused on soul iheartmedia urban and urban ac stations are branded as real krrl los angeles beat kqbthouston wbtp tampa or power wwpr new york city wusl philadelphia and when syracuse in san francisco iheartmedia owned more urbanrelated stations such as rhythmic top  kyld urban oldies kisq and urban contemporary kmel in that area kyld

classic hiphopthrowbackold school consisting of rbhiphop rap and rhythmic songs from the s s and s can be heard fulltime on iheartradio as well as kmjmst louis and kubthd  its translator in honolulu previously this format was originated as rhythmic oldies which was launched at kcmglos angeles and later spread to more markets before the former clear channel flipped several stations out of the format by the mids for the rhythmic top  format similar brandings include the beat kubthonolulu and wbttft myers power el paso  kiss fmbeaumont texas jamn kxjmportland oregon and wjmnfmboston a similar jammin is used at wjjsroanoke  wjjxlynchburg hot san antonio and bfresno others rhythmics such as kdonfmsalinasmonterey and kggiriversidesan bernardino simply use the call letters andor frequency most of these stations target a multicultural audience and play rhythmic pop rbhiphop and dance tracks for rhythmic ac stations they used to have the party branding particularly during the time when most used wake up with whoopi as their morning show but the two party stations in denver kptt and las vegas kymt the former kplv have since exited the rhythmic ac format kptt and kplv moved to top  but continue to use the party branding all iheartmedia rhythmic ac stations are now differently branded per station although one of the outlets wmovfmnorfolk uses the movin moniker which is trademarked under another company the breakfast club morning show out of wwprfm in new york and big boys neighborhood out of krrl in los angeles are iheartmedias syndicated urban morning shows smooth jazzedit as noted earlier iheartmedia has the smooth jazz network aka your smooth jazz which is programmed by broadcast architecture unless otherwise noted all smooth jazz network stations will carry the following schedule kenny g and sandy kovach in morning drive time miranda wilson in midday allen kepler in afternoon drive time and maria lopez in evenings with no disc jockeys overnight weekend programming consists of the smooth jazz top  with allen kepler as well as the dave koz radio show this network is broadcast via hd subchannels of many iheartmediaowned stations such as wmgf in orlando although not all stations will carry it often opting to substitute its own programming as is done with wdas am in philadelphia dance and edmedit although they have no fullpowered stations programming a dance or edm electronic dance music format the only one being wedxboston iheartmedia has fm translators and hd platforms broadcasting the edmintensive evolution platform while the lgbt community is served by the more broaderbased pride radio however iheartmedias top chr and rhythmic top  outlets incorporate a majority of dance songs onto its playlist and set aside airtime blocks for mix shows news talk stationsedit news talk stations owned by iheartmedia usually have a standard slate of hosts the morning show is usually local with other timeslots filled by local and syndicated hosts programs that appear on many iheartmedia talk stations include the glenn beck program beck having gotten his talk show start at iheartmedia then clear channel owned wfla am in tampa the rush limbaugh show the sean hannity show america now with meghan mccain and coast to coast am with george noory all of which are affiliated with premiere radio networks in some fashion the mark levin show and the dave ramsey show are nonpremiere shows who air on many if not most iheartmedia stations as did the savage nation prior to its ending in september  limbaugh is almost universally carried on iheartmedia stations in markets where the company has a news talk station including recently new york city wor was acquired in  by clear channel and began carrying limbaughs program in  following a long relationship with nowcumulus mediaowned wabc in markets where iheartmediaowned news talk stations have not been profitable such as boston and atlanta iheartmedia has chosen to sell shows such as limbaugh and coast to coast am to their rivals and change the stations to other formats while most of iheartmedias newstalk stations carry some combination of beck limbaugh hannity and noory of coast to coast am this is not always the case many stations particularly in the larger markets like kfi kfyi koa wzzr and wlw broadcast a lineup with significant local programming iheartmedia does not operate any allnews radio stations for a brief time in the late s kfxr in dallas ran a direct feed of hln under the onair name cnn  but kfxr dropped that format in  almost all of iheartmedias primary talk stations are affiliated with fox news radio for national news part of a multiyear deal between iheartmedia and fox however since  iheartmedia has provided an allnews feed called  news this radio network is exclusive to iheartradio since   news partners with nbc news to launch the nbc news radio liberal talk radio is heard on a few of iheartmedias stations primarily secondary to its main news talk stations and usually feature at least one local host with dial global programming air america radio also aired on these stations iheartmedia has shown a tendency to drop liberal talk affiliations due to lack of ratings or advertiser support and replace it with sports talk or other formats see for instance wcky warf klsd wxks and winz in one case this had caused a protest when iheartmedia then clear channel wanted to change wxxm in madison wisconsin to a sports format wxxm was eventually allowed to keep its liberal format though they eventually retired it in november  due to a general lack of syndicated programming for that format iheartmedia has been active in the national trend of simulcasting its am newstalk stations on fullpower fm stations hoping to preserve their longterm viability while am radio declines examples include san diego california on kuss  which became kogofm after simulcasting kogo am replacing country music sacramento california on kgby  which became

stations circulated a list of songs that were deemed inappropriate for broadcast during the time of national mourning following the attacks a small list was initially generated by the clear channel office on thursday september   though individual program directors added many of their own songs a list containing about  songs was soon published on the internet some critics suggested that clear channels political preferences played a part in the list a number of songs were apparently placed on the list because they had specific words such as plane fly burn and falling in their titles clear channel denies that this was a list of banned songs claiming it was a list of titles that should be played only after great thought also wofx cincinnati owned by clear channel at the time continued to play songs that were on the alleged list even though radio headquarters was in cincinnati at the time songs on the list included tom pettys free fallin louis armstrongs what a wonderful world and the

recorded directly from the sound engineers console during the show and then rapidly burned on cd so that audience members can buy copies of the show as they are leaving the venue this had been intended to provide additional revenue to the artist venue and promoter as well as stifle the demand for unauthorized bootleg concert recordings made by audience members however some media critics as well as smaller business rivals believed that clear channel was using the patent on the process of adding cues to the beginning and ending of tracks during recording so that the concert is not burned as a single enormous track to drive competitors out of business or force them to pay licensing fees even if they do not use precisely the same process the patent was transferred to live nation when clear channel entertainment was spun off but the patent was revoked on march   after it was found that this patent infringed on a prior patent granted for telex indecency zero toleranceedit this

syndicated by iheartmedia see also premiere networks iheartmedia operates the countrys largest syndication service premiere networks in addition iheartmedia syndicates a number of its homegrown talk and music shows without the aid of premiere while premiere actively sells its shows to stations the nonpremiere syndicated shows are often used as a costcutting measure and do not have a large sales staff those shows also do not carry networkwide advertising unless distributed by a third party and allow the affiliates to keep all local spots which increases their appeal these networks carry many program hosts of various political ideologies and distribute a variety of programs to both iheartmediaowned and noniheartmediaowned stations in addition to its own syndication network iheartmedia offers studio space and other services to the weststar talkradio network which is based at iheartmedias studios in phoenix arizona as a result many weststar programs are heard on iheartmedia stations

project broadcasting on waxqfm  hd in new york city urban urban ac and rhythmic stationsedit stations that carry programming catering to black americans are a big part of many iheartmedia clusters particularly philadelphia chicago and detroit in many clusters iheartmedia has two or more such stations about half the urban stations focus on rap and hip hop along with younger rhythm and blues sounds the other half blend some younger rhythm and blues along with some soul from the s s and s along with some current product some of the hip hopbased urban stations report as rhythmic top  stations rather than urban stations because these stations also have some appeal to white and hispanic listeners in a cluster with multiple urban stations owned by iheartmedia one is focused on rap while the other is focused on soul examples include philadelphia with wusls focus on hip hop while wdasfm focuses on soul in addition the company also owns a rhythmic ac station in that area which is wisx  and chicago where wgcifm focuses on rap while wvaz is focused on soul iheartmedia urban and urban ac stations are branded as real krrl los angeles beat kqbthouston wbtp tampa or power wwpr new

previously this format was originated as rhythmic oldies which was launched at kcmglos angeles and later spread to more markets before the former clear channel flipped several stations out of the

frequency most of these stations target a multicultural audience and play rhythmic pop rbhiphop and dance tracks for rhythmic ac stations they used to have the party branding particularly during the time when most used wake up with whoopi as their morning show but the two party stations in denver kptt and las vegas kymt the former kplv have since exited the rhythmic ac format kptt and kplv moved to top  but continue to use the party branding all iheartmedia rhythmic ac stations are now differently branded per station although one of the outlets wmovfmnorfolk uses the movin moniker which is trademarked under another company the breakfast club morning show out of wwprfm in new york and big boys neighborhood out of krrl in los angeles are iheartmedias syndicated urban morning shows smooth jazzedit as noted earlier iheartmedia has the smooth jazz network aka your smooth jazz which is programmed by broadcast architecture unless otherwise noted all smooth jazz network stations will carry the following schedule kenny g and sandy kovach in morning drive time miranda wilson in midday allen kepler in afternoon drive time and maria lopez in evenings with no disc jockeys overnight weekend programming consists of the smooth jazz top  with allen kepler as well as the dave koz radio show this network is broadcast via hd subchannels of many iheartmediaowned stations such as wmgf in orlando although not all stations will carry it often opting to substitute its own programming as is done with wdas am in philadelphia dance and edmedit although they have no fullpowered stations programming a dance or edm electronic dance music format the only one being wedxboston iheartmedia has fm translators and hd platforms broadcasting the edmintensive evolution platform while the lgbt community is served by the more broaderbased pride radio however iheartmedias top chr and rhythmic top  outlets incorporate a majority of dance songs onto its playlist and set aside airtime blocks for mix shows news talk stationsedit news talk stations owned by iheartmedia usually have a standard slate of hosts the morning show is usually local with other timeslots filled by local and syndicated hosts programs that appear on many iheartmedia talk stations include the glenn beck program beck having gotten his talk show start at iheartmedia then clear channel owned wfla am in tampa the rush limbaugh show the sean hannity show america now with meghan mccain and coast to coast am with george noory all of which are affiliated with premiere radio networks in some fashion the mark levin show and the dave ramsey show are nonpremiere shows who air on many if not most iheartmedia stations as did the savage nation prior to its ending in september  limbaugh is almost universally carried on iheartmedia stations in markets where the company has a news talk station including recently new york city wor was acquired in  by clear channel and began carrying limbaughs program in  following a long relationship with nowcumulus mediaowned wabc in markets where iheartmediaowned news talk stations have not been profitable such as boston and atlanta iheartmedia has chosen to sell shows such as limbaugh and coast to coast am to their rivals and change the stations to other formats while most of iheartmedias newstalk stations carry some combination of beck limbaugh hannity and noory of coast to coast am this is not always the case many stations particularly in the larger markets like kfi kfyi koa wzzr and wlw broadcast a lineup with significant local programming iheartmedia does not operate any allnews radio stations for a brief time in the late s kfxr in dallas ran a direct feed of hln under the onair name cnn  but kfxr dropped that format in  almost all of iheartmedias primary talk stations are affiliated with fox news radio for national news part of a multiyear deal between iheartmedia and fox however since  iheartmedia has provided an allnews feed called  news this radio network is exclusive to iheartradio since   news partners with nbc news to launch the nbc news radio liberal talk radio is heard on a few of iheartmedias stations primarily secondary to its main news talk stations and usually feature at least one local host with dial global programming air america radio also aired on these stations iheartmedia has shown a tendency to drop liberal talk affiliations due to lack of ratings or advertiser support and replace it with sports talk or other formats see for instance wcky warf klsd wxks and winz in one case this had caused a protest when iheartmedia then clear channel wanted to change wxxm in madison wisconsin to a sports format wxxm was eventually allowed to keep its liberal format though they eventually retired it in november  due to a general lack of syndicated programming for that format iheartmedia has been active in the national trend of simulcasting its am newstalk stations on fullpower fm stations hoping to preserve their longterm viability while am radio declines examples include san diego california on kuss  which became kogofm after simulcasting kogo am replacing country music sacramento california on kgby  which became kfbkfm after simulcasting kfbk replacing hot adult contemporary in tucson arizona on ktzrfm which became knstfm after simulcasting knst replacing spanish top  in schenectady new york wgyfm simulcasting wgy replacing rock whrl and syracuse new york wsyrfm simulcasting wsyr displacing urban ac power to when after failing to see any significant ratings gains from these moves clear channel showed signs of abandoning this strategy when it changed knstfm to country music in february  as kywd sports talk stationsedit in the twentieth century the most recognizable form of sports talk radio was major league baseball before becoming a major media force sports talk radio in the united states enjoyed a long growth period in the s americans found love and passion in boxing which lead boxing to become the very first sporting event that was broadcast on sports talk radio to a wideopen audience sports talk stations are changing and evolving as are the interests of new generations of listeners most sports talk stations owned by iheartmedia are affiliated with fox sports radio they are usually branded either fox sports or the sports animal other sports talk stations are affiliated with rival espn radio in this case wucs in hartford connecticut which is nearby espns headquarters in bristol adult standardsedit most of iheartmedias adult standards stations are turnkey operations running a direct feed of a satellite format such as dial globals americas best music or music of your life most of these stations have no local jocks or web sites the network has few remaining stations in that category and has sold off many of them adult contemporaryedit iheartmedias adult contemporary stations are often branded as lite fm ie wlit in chicago wltw in new york or wlko in charlotte or sunny although some stations use magic b or something else similar as their identifiers evenings are usually filled with delilah unless that show is already aired by another station in which case the john tesh radio show is often substituted automated programming is the next option for the pm  am timeslot your weekend with jim brickman and the inhouse american top  the s or s with casey kasem are popular weekend syndicated programs on iheartmedia stations most ac stations air christmas music from the last week of november to christmas day some ac iheartmedia stations are almost famous for playing christmas music as early as november  such as kaazfm in salt lake city or wlko playing its first christmas song of the season – weeks before thanksgiving  of iheartmedia stations that play adult contemporary air christmas formats hot adult contemporary stations are usually branded as mix star or myfm ie kbig in los angeles some hot ac stations lean modern rock while others lean toward adult rock other hot ac stations have other brandings such as wild  and  on wrda in atlanta contemporary hit radioedit iheartmedias chr stations share a number of common brands including

branding can be heard however when a preferred format name is already in use by another station in the market although a majority of these stations features a broadbased mass appeal music presentation several stations like wsnxgrand rapids and wktunew york city tend to lean towards rhythmic material due to having a sister station in the same format wktus sister is whtz or a lack of a rhythmic or rbhiphop outlet a void which wsnx also tries to fill many iheartmedia chr stations utilize syndicated morning shows such as dcs the kane show especially in the middle atlantic and uppermidwest states

universally carry after midnite the syndicated overnight program currently hosted by cody alan and often carry bobby boness morning show as well oldies and classic hitsedit iheartmedias oldies stations consists largely of fm stations with some am stations iheartmedia uses brands such as big and kool on many of its stations nearly all of the fm stations play oldies spanning from  to  with a

recorded directly from the sound engineers console during the show and then rapidly burned on cd so that audience members can buy copies of the show as they are leaving the venue this had been intended to provide additional revenue to the artist venue and promoter as well as stifle the demand for unauthorized bootleg concert recordings made by audience members however some media critics as well as smaller business rivals believed that clear channel was using the patent on the process of adding cues to the beginning and ending of tracks during recording so that the concert is not burned as a single enormous track to drive competitors out of business or force them to pay licensing fees even if they do not use precisely the same process the patent was transferred to live nation when

the following schedule kenny g and sandy kovach in morning drive time miranda wilson in midday allen kepler in afternoon drive time and maria lopez in evenings with no disc jockeys overnight weekend programming consists of the smooth jazz top  with allen kepler as well as the dave koz radio show this network is broadcast via hd subchannels of many iheartmediaowned stations such as wmgf in orlando although not all stations will carry it often opting to substitute its own programming as is done with wdas am in philadelphia dance and edmedit although they have no fullpowered stations programming a dance or edm electronic dance music format the only one being wedxboston iheartmedia has fm translators and hd platforms broadcasting the edmintensive evolution platform while the lgbt community is served by the more broaderbased pride radio however iheartmedias top chr and rhythmic top  outlets incorporate a majority of dance songs onto its playlist and set aside airtime blocks for mix shows news talk stationsedit news talk stations owned by iheartmedia usually have a standard slate of hosts the morning show is usually local with other timeslots filled by local and syndicated hosts programs that appear on many iheartmedia talk stations include the glenn beck program beck having gotten his talk show start at iheartmedia then clear channel owned wfla am in tampa the rush limbaugh show the sean hannity show america now with meghan mccain and coast to coast am with george noory all of which are affiliated with premiere radio networks in some fashion the mark levin show and the dave ramsey show are nonpremiere shows who air on many if not most iheartmedia stations as did the savage nation prior to its ending in september  limbaugh is almost universally carried on iheartmedia stations in markets where the company has a news talk station including recently new york city wor was acquired in  by clear channel and began carrying limbaughs program in  following a long relationship with nowcumulus mediaowned wabc in markets where iheartmediaowned news talk stations have not been profitable such as boston and atlanta iheartmedia has chosen to sell shows such as limbaugh and coast to coast am to their rivals and change the stations to other formats while most of iheartmedias newstalk stations carry some combination of beck limbaugh hannity and noory of coast to coast am this is not always the case many stations particularly in the larger markets like kfi kfyi koa wzzr and wlw broadcast a lineup with significant local programming iheartmedia does not operate any allnews radio stations for a brief time in the late s kfxr in dallas ran a direct feed of hln under the onair name cnn  but kfxr dropped that format in  almost all of iheartmedias primary talk stations are affiliated with fox news radio for national news part of a multiyear deal between iheartmedia and fox however since  iheartmedia has provided an allnews feed called  news this radio network is exclusive to iheartradio since   news partners with nbc news to launch the nbc news radio liberal talk radio is heard on a few of iheartmedias stations primarily secondary to its main news talk stations and usually feature at least one local host with dial global programming air america radio also aired on these stations iheartmedia has shown a tendency to drop liberal talk affiliations due to lack of ratings or advertiser support and replace it with sports talk or other formats see for instance wcky warf klsd wxks and winz in one case this had caused a protest when iheartmedia then clear channel wanted to change wxxm in madison wisconsin to a sports format wxxm was eventually allowed to keep its liberal format though they eventually retired it in november  due to a general lack of syndicated programming for that format iheartmedia has been active in the national trend of simulcasting its am newstalk stations on fullpower fm stations hoping to preserve their longterm viability while am radio declines examples include san diego california on kuss  which became kogofm after simulcasting kogo am replacing country music sacramento california on kgby  which became kfbkfm after simulcasting kfbk replacing hot adult contemporary in tucson arizona on ktzrfm which became knstfm after simulcasting knst replacing spanish top  in schenectady new york wgyfm simulcasting wgy replacing rock whrl and syracuse new york wsyrfm simulcasting wsyr displacing urban ac power to when after failing to see any significant ratings gains from these moves clear channel showed signs of abandoning this strategy when it changed knstfm to country music in february  as kywd sports talk stationsedit in the twentieth century the most recognizable form of sports talk radio was major league baseball before becoming a major media force sports talk radio in the united states enjoyed a long growth period in the s americans found love and passion in boxing which lead boxing to become the very first sporting event that was broadcast on sports talk radio to a wideopen audience sports talk stations are changing and evolving as are the interests of new generations of listeners most sports talk stations owned by iheartmedia are affiliated with fox sports radio they are usually branded either fox sports or the sports animal other sports talk stations are affiliated with rival espn radio in this case wucs in hartford connecticut which is nearby espns headquarters in bristol adult standardsedit most of iheartmedias adult standards stations are turnkey operations running a direct feed of a satellite format such as dial globals americas best music or music of your life most of these stations have no local jocks or web sites the network has few remaining stations in that category and has sold off many of them adult contemporaryedit iheartmedias adult contemporary stations are often branded as lite fm ie wlit in chicago wltw in new york or wlko in charlotte or sunny although some stations use magic b or something else similar as their identifiers evenings are usually filled with delilah unless that show is already aired by another station in which case the john tesh radio show is often substituted automated programming is the next option for the pm  am timeslot your weekend with jim brickman and the inhouse american top  the s or s with casey kasem are popular weekend syndicated programs on iheartmedia stations most ac stations air christmas music from the last week of november to christmas day some ac iheartmedia stations are almost famous for playing christmas music as early as november  such as kaazfm in salt lake city or wlko playing its first christmas song of the season – weeks before thanksgiving  of iheartmedia stations that play adult contemporary air christmas formats hot adult contemporary stations are usually branded as mix star or myfm ie kbig in los angeles some hot ac stations lean modern rock while others

several stations like wsnxgrand rapids and wktunew york city tend to lean towards rhythmic material due to having a sister station in the same format wktus sister is whtz or a lack of a rhythmic or

stations circulated a list of songs that were deemed inappropriate for broadcast during the time of national mourning following the attacks a small list was initially generated by the clear channel office on thursday september   though individual program directors added many of their own songs a list containing about  songs was soon published on the internet some critics suggested that clear channels political preferences played a part in the list a number of songs were apparently placed on the list because they had specific words such as plane fly burn and falling in their titles clear channel denies that this was a list of banned songs claiming it was a list of titles that should be played only after great thought also wofx cincinnati owned by clear channel at the time continued to play songs that were on the alleged list even though radio headquarters was in cincinnati at the time songs on the list included tom pettys free fallin louis armstrongs what a wonderful world and the entire rage against the machine discography live music recordingsedit in  clear channel acquired a key patent in the process of producing instant live recordings in which a live performance is recorded directly from the sound engineers console during the show and then rapidly burned on cd so that audience members can buy copies of the show as they are leaving the venue this had been intended to provide additional revenue to the artist venue and promoter as well as stifle the demand for unauthorized bootleg concert recordings made by audience members however some media critics as well as smaller business rivals believed that clear channel was using the patent on the process of adding cues to the beginning and ending of tracks during recording so that the concert is not burned as a single enormous track to drive competitors out of business or force them to pay licensing fees even if they do not use precisely the same process the patent was transferred to live nation when clear channel entertainment was spun off but the patent was revoked on march   after it was found that this patent infringed on a prior patent granted for telex indecency zero toleranceedit this

local programmingedit iheartmedia uses the rcs nexgen automation system throughout their properties like most contemporary automation systems nexgen allows a dj from anywhere in the country to sound as if he or she is broadcasting from anywhere else in the country on any other station a technological outgrowth of earlier tapebased automation systems dating back to the s this method—known as voicetracking—allows for smaller market stations to be partially or completely staffed by cyberjocks who may never have visited the town from which they are broadcasting this practice may also result

manager was finally reached at his home in the meantime  operators were advising panicked callers to tune to kcjb for emergency instructions but the station was not broadcasting any such information the ammonia spill was the largest of its kind in the united states with one person killed and over  seeking medical attention clear channel claimed no responsibility for its failure to warn residents maintaining that the city should have used the emergency alert system to trigger automatic equipment in place at all us radio stations the eas equipment was later found to be functional at the time but had not been activated by city state or regional authorities unfortunately other critical systems throughout minot were either inoperable or had failed including the public siren system

syndicated by iheartmedia see also premiere networks iheartmedia operates the countrys largest syndication service premiere networks in addition iheartmedia syndicates a number of its homegrown talk and music shows without the aid of premiere while premiere actively sells its shows to stations the nonpremiere syndicated shows are often used as a costcutting measure and do not have a large sales staff those shows also do not carry networkwide advertising unless distributed by a third party and allow the affiliates to keep all local spots which increases their appeal these networks carry many program hosts of various political ideologies and distribute a variety of programs to both iheartmediaowned and noniheartmediaowned stations in addition to its own syndication network iheartmedia offers studio space and other services to the weststar talkradio network which is based at iheartmedias studios in phoenix arizona as a result many weststar programs are heard on iheartmedia stations

particularly philadelphia chicago and detroit in many clusters iheartmedia has two or more such stations about half the urban stations focus on rap and hip hop along with younger rhythm and blues sounds the other half blend some younger rhythm and blues along with some soul from the s s and s along with some current product some of the hip hopbased urban stations report as rhythmic top  stations rather than urban stations because these stations also have some appeal to white and hispanic listeners in a cluster with multiple urban stations owned by iheartmedia one is focused on rap while the other is focused on soul examples include philadelphia with wusls focus on hip hop while wdasfm focuses on soul in addition the company also owns a rhythmic ac station in that area which is wisx  and chicago where wgcifm focuses on rap while wvaz is focused on soul iheartmedia urban and urban ac stations are branded as real krrl los angeles beat kqbthouston wbtp tampa or power wwpr new

time when most used wake up with whoopi as their morning show but the two party stations in denver kptt and las vegas kymt the former kplv have since exited the rhythmic ac format kptt and kplv moved to top  but continue to use the party branding all iheartmedia rhythmic ac stations are now differently branded per station although one of the outlets wmovfmnorfolk uses the movin moniker which is trademarked under another company the breakfast club morning show out of wwprfm in new york and big boys neighborhood out of krrl in los angeles are iheartmedias syndicated urban morning shows smooth jazzedit as noted earlier iheartmedia has the smooth jazz network aka your smooth jazz which is programmed by broadcast architecture unless otherwise noted all smooth jazz network stations will carry the following schedule kenny g and sandy kovach in morning drive time miranda wilson in midday allen kepler in afternoon drive time and maria lopez in evenings with no disc jockeys overnight weekend programming consists of the smooth jazz top  with allen kepler as well as the dave koz radio show this network is broadcast via hd subchannels of many iheartmediaowned stations such as wmgf in orlando

a dance or edm electronic dance music format the only one being wedxboston iheartmedia has fm translators and hd platforms broadcasting the edmintensive evolution platform while the lgbt community is served by the more broaderbased pride radio however iheartmedias top chr and rhythmic top  outlets incorporate a majority of dance songs onto its playlist and set aside airtime blocks for mix shows news talk stationsedit news talk stations owned by iheartmedia usually have a standard slate of hosts the morning show is usually local with other timeslots filled by local and syndicated hosts programs that appear on many iheartmedia talk stations include the glenn beck program beck having gotten his talk show start at iheartmedia then clear channel owned wfla am in tampa the rush limbaugh show the sean hannity show america now with meghan mccain and coast to coast am with george noory all of which are affiliated with premiere radio networks in some fashion the mark levin show and the dave ramsey show are nonpremiere shows who air on many if not most iheartmedia stations as did the savage nation prior to its ending in september  limbaugh is almost universally carried on iheartmedia stations in markets where the company has a news talk station including recently new york city wor was acquired in  by clear channel and began carrying limbaughs program in  following a long relationship with nowcumulus mediaowned wabc in markets where iheartmediaowned news talk stations have not been profitable such as boston and atlanta iheartmedia has chosen to sell shows such as limbaugh and coast to coast am to their rivals and change the stations to other formats while most of iheartmedias newstalk stations carry some combination of beck limbaugh hannity and noory of coast to coast am this is not always the case many stations particularly in the larger markets like kfi kfyi koa wzzr and wlw broadcast a lineup with significant local programming iheartmedia does not operate any allnews radio stations for a brief time in the late s kfxr in dallas ran a direct feed of hln under the onair name cnn  but kfxr dropped that format in  almost all of iheartmedias primary talk stations are affiliated with fox news radio for national news part of a multiyear deal between iheartmedia and fox however since  iheartmedia has provided an allnews feed called  news this radio

stations circulated a list of songs that were deemed inappropriate for broadcast during the time of national mourning following the attacks a small list was initially generated by the clear channel office on thursday september   though individual program directors added many of their own songs a list containing about  songs was soon published on the internet some critics suggested that clear channels political preferences played a part in the list a number of songs were apparently placed on the list because they had specific words such as plane fly burn and falling in their titles clear channel denies that this was a list of banned songs claiming it was a list of titles that should be played only after great thought also wofx cincinnati owned by clear channel at the time continued to play songs that were on the alleged list even though radio headquarters was in cincinnati at the time songs on the list included tom pettys free fallin louis armstrongs what a wonderful world and the entire rage against the machine discography live music recordingsedit in  clear channel acquired a key patent in the process of producing instant live recordings in which a live performance is recorded directly from the sound engineers console during the show and then rapidly burned on cd so that audience members can buy copies of the show as they are leaving the venue this had been intended to provide additional revenue to the artist venue and promoter as well as stifle the demand for unauthorized bootleg concert recordings made by audience members however some media critics as well as smaller business rivals believed that clear channel was using the patent on the process of adding cues to the beginning and ending of tracks during recording so that the concert is not burned as a single enormous track to drive competitors out of business or force them to pay licensing fees even if they do not use precisely the same process the patent was transferred to live nation when clear channel entertainment was spun off but the patent was revoked on march   after it was found that this patent infringed on a prior patent granted for telex indecency zero toleranceedit this

local programmingedit iheartmedia uses the rcs nexgen automation system throughout their properties like most contemporary automation systems nexgen allows a dj from anywhere in the country to sound as if he or she is broadcasting from anywhere else in the country on any other station a technological outgrowth of earlier tapebased automation systems dating back to the s this method—known as voicetracking—allows for smaller market stations to be partially or completely staffed by cyberjocks who may never have visited the town from which they are broadcasting this practice may also result

the ammonia spill was the largest of its kind in the united states with one person killed and over  seeking medical attention clear channel claimed no responsibility for its failure to warn residents maintaining that the city should have used the emergency alert system to trigger automatic equipment in place at all us radio stations the eas equipment was later found to be functional at the time but had not been activated by city state or regional authorities unfortunately other critical systems throughout minot were either inoperable or had failed including the public siren system

syndicated by iheartmedia see also premiere networks iheartmedia operates the countrys largest syndication service premiere networks in addition iheartmedia syndicates a number of its homegrown talk and music shows without the aid of premiere while premiere actively sells its shows to stations the nonpremiere syndicated shows are often used as a costcutting measure and do not have a large sales staff those shows also do not carry networkwide advertising unless distributed by a third party and allow the affiliates to keep all local spots which increases their appeal these networks carry many program hosts of various political ideologies and distribute a variety of programs to both iheartmediaowned and noniheartmediaowned stations in addition to its own syndication network iheartmedia offers studio space and other services to the weststar talkradio network which is based at iheartmedias studios in phoenix arizona as a result many weststar programs are heard on iheartmedia stations

project broadcasting on waxqfm  hd in new york city urban urban ac and rhythmic stationsedit stations that carry programming catering to black americans are a big part of many iheartmedia clusters particularly philadelphia chicago and detroit in many clusters iheartmedia has two or more such stations about half the urban stations focus on rap and hip hop along with younger rhythm and blues sounds the other half blend some younger rhythm and blues along with some soul from the s s and s along with some current product some of the hip hopbased urban stations report as rhythmic top  stations rather than urban stations because these stations also have some appeal to white and hispanic listeners in a cluster with multiple urban stations owned by iheartmedia one is focused on rap while the other is focused on soul examples include philadelphia with wusls focus on hip hop while wdasfm focuses on soul in addition the company also owns a rhythmic ac station in that area which is wisx  and chicago where wgcifm focuses on rap while wvaz is focused on soul iheartmedia urban and urban ac stations are branded as real krrl los angeles beat kqbthouston wbtp tampa or power wwpr new

previously this format was originated as rhythmic oldies which was launched at kcmglos angeles and later spread to more markets before the former clear channel flipped several stations out of the

similar jammin is used at wjjsroanoke  wjjxlynchburg hot san antonio and bfresno others rhythmics such as kdonfmsalinasmonterey and kggiriversidesan bernardino simply use the call letters andor frequency most of these stations target a multicultural audience and play rhythmic pop rbhiphop and dance tracks for rhythmic ac stations they used to have the party branding particularly during the time when most used wake up with whoopi as their morning show but the two party stations in denver kptt and las vegas kymt the former kplv have since exited the rhythmic ac format kptt and kplv moved to top  but continue to use the party branding all iheartmedia rhythmic ac stations are now differently branded per station although one of the outlets wmovfmnorfolk uses the movin moniker which is trademarked under another company the breakfast club morning show out of wwprfm in new york and big boys neighborhood out of krrl in los angeles are iheartmedias syndicated urban morning shows smooth jazzedit as noted earlier iheartmedia has the smooth jazz network aka your smooth jazz which is programmed by broadcast architecture unless otherwise noted all smooth jazz network stations will carry the following schedule kenny g and sandy kovach in morning drive time miranda wilson in midday allen kepler in afternoon drive time and maria lopez in evenings with no disc jockeys overnight weekend programming consists of the smooth jazz top  with allen kepler as well as the dave koz radio show this network is broadcast via hd subchannels of many iheartmediaowned stations such as wmgf in orlando although not all stations will carry it often opting to substitute its own programming as is done with wdas am in philadelphia dance and edmedit although they have no fullpowered stations programming a dance or edm electronic dance music format the only one being wedxboston iheartmedia has fm translators and hd platforms broadcasting the edmintensive evolution platform while the lgbt community is served by the more broaderbased pride radio however iheartmedias top chr and rhythmic top  outlets incorporate a majority of dance songs onto its playlist and set aside airtime blocks for mix shows news talk stationsedit news talk stations owned by iheartmedia usually have a standard slate of hosts the morning show is usually local with other timeslots filled by local and syndicated hosts programs that appear on many iheartmedia talk stations include the glenn beck program beck having gotten his talk show start at iheartmedia then clear channel owned wfla am in tampa the rush limbaugh show the sean hannity show america now with meghan mccain and coast to coast am with george noory all of which are affiliated with premiere radio networks in some fashion the mark levin show and the dave ramsey show are nonpremiere shows who air on many if not most iheartmedia stations as did the savage nation prior to its ending in september  limbaugh is almost universally carried on iheartmedia stations in markets where the company has a news talk station including recently new york city wor was acquired in  by clear channel and began carrying limbaughs program in  following a long relationship with nowcumulus mediaowned wabc in markets where iheartmediaowned news talk stations have not been profitable such as boston and atlanta iheartmedia has chosen to sell shows such as limbaugh and coast to coast am to their rivals and change the stations to other formats while most of iheartmedias newstalk stations carry some combination of beck limbaugh hannity and noory of coast to coast am this is not always the case many stations particularly in the larger markets like kfi kfyi koa wzzr and wlw broadcast a lineup with significant local programming iheartmedia does not operate any allnews radio stations for a brief time in the late s kfxr in dallas ran a direct feed of hln under the onair name cnn  but kfxr dropped that format in  almost all of iheartmedias primary talk stations are affiliated with fox news radio for national news part of a multiyear deal between iheartmedia and fox however since  iheartmedia has provided an allnews feed called  news this radio network is exclusive to iheartradio since   news partners with nbc news to launch the nbc news radio liberal talk radio is heard on a few of iheartmedias stations primarily secondary to its main news talk stations and usually feature at least one local host with dial global programming air america radio also aired on these stations iheartmedia has shown a tendency to drop liberal talk affiliations due to lack of ratings or advertiser support and replace it with sports talk or other formats see for instance wcky warf klsd wxks and winz in one case this had caused a protest when iheartmedia then clear channel wanted to change wxxm in madison wisconsin to a sports format wxxm was eventually allowed to keep its liberal format though they eventually retired it in november  due to a general lack of syndicated programming for that format iheartmedia has been active in the national trend of simulcasting its am newstalk stations on fullpower fm stations hoping to preserve their longterm viability while am radio declines examples include san diego california on kuss  which became kogofm after simulcasting kogo am replacing country music sacramento california on kgby  which became kfbkfm after simulcasting kfbk replacing hot adult contemporary in tucson arizona on ktzrfm which became knstfm after simulcasting knst replacing spanish top  in schenectady new york wgyfm simulcasting wgy replacing rock whrl and syracuse new york wsyrfm simulcasting wsyr displacing urban ac power to when after failing to see any significant ratings gains from these moves clear channel showed signs of abandoning this strategy when it changed knstfm to country music in february  as kywd sports talk stationsedit in the twentieth century the most recognizable form of sports talk radio was major league baseball before becoming a major media force sports talk radio in the united states enjoyed a long growth period in the s americans found love and passion in boxing which lead boxing to become the very first sporting event that was broadcast on sports talk radio to a wideopen audience sports talk stations are changing and evolving as are the interests of new generations of listeners most sports talk stations owned by iheartmedia are affiliated with fox sports radio they are usually branded either fox sports or the sports animal other sports talk stations are affiliated with rival espn radio in this case wucs in hartford connecticut which is nearby espns headquarters in bristol adult standardsedit most of iheartmedias adult standards stations are turnkey operations running a direct feed of a satellite format such as dial globals americas best music or music of your life most of these stations have no local jocks or web sites the network has few remaining stations in that category and has sold off many of them adult contemporaryedit iheartmedias adult contemporary stations are often branded as lite fm ie wlit in chicago wltw in new york or wlko in charlotte or sunny although some stations use magic b or something else similar as their identifiers evenings are usually filled with delilah unless that show is already aired by another station in which case the john tesh radio show is often substituted automated programming is the next option for the pm  am timeslot your weekend with jim brickman and the inhouse american top  the s or s with casey kasem are popular weekend syndicated programs on iheartmedia stations most ac stations air christmas music from the last week of november to christmas day some ac iheartmedia stations are almost famous for playing christmas music as early as november  such as kaazfm in salt lake city or wlko playing its first christmas song of the season – weeks before thanksgiving  of iheartmedia stations that play adult contemporary air christmas formats hot adult contemporary stations are usually branded as mix star or myfm ie kbig in los angeles some hot ac stations lean modern rock while others lean toward adult rock other hot ac stations have other brandings such as wild  and  on wrda in atlanta contemporary hit radioedit iheartmedias chr stations share a number of common brands including

branding can be heard however when a preferred format name is already in use by another station in the market although a majority of these stations features a broadbased mass appeal music presentation several stations like wsnxgrand rapids and wktunew york city tend to lean towards rhythmic material due to having a sister station in the same format wktus sister is whtz or a lack of a rhythmic or rbhiphop outlet a void which wsnx also tries to fill many iheartmedia chr stations utilize syndicated morning shows such as dcs the kane show especially in the middle atlantic and uppermidwest states

office on thursday september   though individual program directors added many of their own songs a list containing about  songs was soon published on the internet some critics suggested that clear channels political preferences played a part in the list a number of songs were apparently placed on the list because they had specific words such as plane fly burn and falling in their titles clear channel denies that this was a list of banned songs claiming it was a list of titles that should be played only after great thought also wofx cincinnati owned by clear channel at the time continued to

recorded directly from the sound engineers console during the show and then rapidly burned on cd so that audience members can buy copies of the show as they are leaving the venue this had been intended to provide additional revenue to the artist venue and promoter as well as stifle the demand for unauthorized bootleg concert recordings made by audience members however some media critics as well as smaller business rivals believed that clear channel was using the patent on the process of adding cues to the beginning and ending of tracks during recording so that the concert is not burned as a single enormous track to drive competitors out of business or force them to pay licensing fees even if they do not use precisely the same process the patent was transferred to live nation when

and music shows without the aid of premiere while premiere actively sells its shows to stations the nonpremiere syndicated shows are often used as a costcutting measure and do not have a large sales staff those shows also do not carry networkwide advertising unless distributed by a third party and allow the affiliates to keep all local spots which increases their appeal these networks carry many program hosts of various political ideologies and distribute a variety of programs to both iheartmediaowned and noniheartmediaowned stations in addition to its own syndication network iheartmedia offers studio space and other services to the weststar talkradio network which is based at iheartmedias studios in phoenix arizona as a result many weststar programs are heard on iheartmedia stations

particularly philadelphia chicago and detroit in many clusters iheartmedia has two or more such stations about half the urban stations focus on rap and hip hop along with younger rhythm and blues sounds the other half blend some younger rhythm and blues along with some soul from the s s and s along with some current product some of the hip hopbased urban stations report as rhythmic top  stations rather than urban stations because these stations also have some appeal to white and hispanic listeners in a cluster with multiple urban stations owned by iheartmedia one is focused on rap while the other is focused on soul examples include philadelphia with wusls focus on hip hop while wdasfm focuses on soul in addition the company also owns a rhythmic ac station in that area which is wisx  and chicago where wgcifm focuses on rap while wvaz is focused on soul iheartmedia urban and urban ac stations are branded as real krrl los angeles beat kqbthouston wbtp tampa or power wwpr new

time when most used wake up with whoopi as their morning show but the two party stations in denver kptt and las vegas kymt the former kplv have since exited the rhythmic ac format kptt and kplv moved to top  but continue to use the party branding all iheartmedia rhythmic ac stations are now differently branded per station although one of the outlets wmovfmnorfolk uses the movin moniker which is trademarked under another company the breakfast club morning show out of wwprfm in new york and big boys neighborhood out of krrl in los angeles are iheartmedias syndicated urban morning shows smooth

a dance or edm electronic dance music format the only one being wedxboston iheartmedia has fm translators and hd platforms broadcasting the edmintensive evolution platform while the lgbt community is served by the more broaderbased pride radio however iheartmedias top chr and rhythmic top  outlets incorporate a majority of dance songs onto its playlist and set aside airtime blocks for mix shows news talk stationsedit news talk stations owned by iheartmedia usually have a standard slate of hosts the morning show is usually local with other timeslots filled by local and syndicated hosts programs that appear on many iheartmedia talk stations include the glenn beck program beck having gotten his talk show start at iheartmedia then clear channel owned wfla am in tampa the rush limbaugh show the sean hannity show america now with meghan mccain and coast to coast am with george noory all of which are affiliated with premiere radio networks in some fashion the mark levin show and the dave ramsey show are nonpremiere shows who air on many if not most iheartmedia stations as did the savage nation prior to its ending in september  limbaugh is almost universally carried on iheartmedia stations in markets where the company has a news talk station including recently new york city wor was acquired in  by clear channel and began carrying limbaughs program in  following a long relationship with nowcumulus mediaowned wabc in markets where iheartmediaowned news talk stations have not been profitable such as boston and atlanta iheartmedia has chosen to sell shows such as limbaugh and coast to coast am to their rivals and change the stations to other formats while most of iheartmedias newstalk stations carry some combination of beck limbaugh hannity and noory of coast to coast am this is not always the case many stations particularly in the larger markets like kfi kfyi koa wzzr and wlw broadcast a lineup with significant local programming iheartmedia does not operate any allnews radio stations for a brief time in the late s kfxr in dallas ran a direct feed of hln under the onair name cnn  but kfxr dropped that format in  almost all of iheartmedias primary talk stations are affiliated with fox news radio for national news part of a multiyear deal between iheartmedia and fox however since  iheartmedia has provided an allnews feed called  news this radio network is exclusive to iheartradio since   news partners with nbc news to launch the nbc news radio liberal talk radio is heard on a few of iheartmedias stations primarily secondary to its main news talk stations and usually feature at least one local host with dial global programming air america radio also aired on these stations iheartmedia has shown a tendency to drop liberal talk affiliations due to lack of ratings or advertiser support and replace it with sports talk or other formats see for instance wcky warf klsd wxks and winz in one case this had caused a protest when iheartmedia then clear channel wanted to change wxxm in madison wisconsin to a sports format wxxm was eventually allowed to keep its liberal format though they eventually retired it in november  due to a general lack of syndicated programming for that format iheartmedia has been active in the national trend of simulcasting its am newstalk stations on fullpower fm stations hoping to preserve their longterm viability while am radio declines examples include san diego california on kuss  which became kogofm after simulcasting kogo am replacing country music sacramento california on kgby  which became kfbkfm after simulcasting kfbk replacing hot adult contemporary in tucson arizona on ktzrfm which became knstfm after simulcasting knst replacing spanish top  in schenectady new york wgyfm simulcasting wgy replacing rock whrl and syracuse new york wsyrfm simulcasting wsyr displacing urban ac power to when after failing to see any significant ratings gains from these moves clear channel showed signs of abandoning this strategy when it changed knstfm to country music in february  as kywd sports talk stationsedit in the twentieth century the most recognizable form of sports talk radio was major league baseball before becoming a major media force sports talk radio in the united states enjoyed a long growth period in the s americans found love and passion in boxing which lead boxing to become the very first sporting event that was broadcast on sports talk radio to a wideopen audience sports talk stations are changing and evolving as are the interests of new generations of listeners most sports talk stations owned by iheartmedia are affiliated with fox sports radio they are usually branded either fox sports or the sports animal other sports talk stations are affiliated with rival espn radio in this case wucs in hartford connecticut which is nearby espns headquarters in bristol adult standardsedit most of iheartmedias adult standards stations are turnkey operations running a direct feed of a satellite format such as dial globals americas best music or music of your life most of these stations have no local jocks or web sites the network has few remaining stations in that category and has sold off many of them adult contemporaryedit iheartmedias adult contemporary stations are often branded as lite fm ie wlit in chicago wltw in new york or wlko in charlotte or sunny although some stations use magic b or something else similar as their identifiers evenings are usually filled with delilah unless that show is already aired by another station in which case the john tesh radio show is often substituted automated programming is the next option for the pm  am timeslot your weekend with jim brickman and the inhouse american top  the s or s with casey kasem are popular weekend syndicated programs on iheartmedia stations most ac stations air christmas music from the last week of november to christmas day some ac iheartmedia stations are almost famous for playing christmas music as early as november  such as kaazfm in salt lake city or wlko playing its first christmas song of the season – weeks before thanksgiving  of iheartmedia stations that play adult contemporary air christmas formats hot adult contemporary stations are usually branded as mix star or myfm ie kbig in los angeles some hot ac stations lean modern rock while others

several stations like wsnxgrand rapids and wktunew york city tend to lean towards rhythmic material due to having a sister station in the same format wktus sister is whtz or a lack of a rhythmic or

recorded directly from the sound engineers console during the show and then rapidly burned on cd so that audience members can buy copies of the show as they are leaving the venue this had been intended to provide additional revenue to the artist venue and promoter as well as stifle the demand for unauthorized bootleg concert recordings made by audience members however some media critics as well as smaller business rivals believed that clear channel was using the patent on the process of adding cues to the beginning and ending of tracks during recording so that the concert is not burned as a single enormous track to drive competitors out of business or force them to pay licensing fees even if they do not use precisely the same process the patent was transferred to live nation when clear channel entertainment was spun off but the patent was revoked on march   after it was found that this patent infringed on a prior patent granted for telex indecency zero toleranceedit this

there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of  months following the date our financial statements are issued a substantial amount of our cash requirements are for debt service obligations although we have generated operating income we incurred net losses and had negative cash flows from operations for the years ended december   and  as well as for the

set forth the company’s oibdan for the three months ended march   and  the company defines oibdan as consolidated operating income adjusted to exclude noncash compensation expenses included within corporate expenses as well as the following line items presented in its statement of comprehensive loss depreciation and amortization impairment charges and other operating income expense netthe company uses oibdan among other measures to evaluate the company’s operating performance this measure is among the primary measures used by management for the planning and forecasting of future periods as well as for measuring performance for compensation of executives and other members of management we believe this measure is an important indicator of the company’s operational strength and performance of its business because it provides a link between operational performance and operating income it is also a primary measure used by management in evaluating companies as potential acquisition targetsthe company believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the company’s management the company believes it helps improve investors’ ability to understand the company’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare the company’s results with other companies that have different capital structures or tax rates in addition the company believes this measure is also among the primary measures used externally by the company’s investors analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the company to other companies in its industrysince oibdan is not a measure calculated in accordance with gaap it should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for operating income as an indicator of operating performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies oibdan is not necessarily a measure of the company’s ability to fund its cash needs as it excludes certain financial information compared with operating income the most directly comparable gaap financial measure users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excludedthe other nongaap financial measures presented in the tables below are i revenues direct operating and sga expenses and oibdan each excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates ii revenues direct operating and sga expenses and oibdan each excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates and the results from outdoor markets and businesses sold iii revenues excluding political advertising revenues and iv corporate expenses excluding noncash compensation expenses and effects of foreign exchange ratesthe company presents revenues direct operating and sga expenses and oibdan each excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates because management believes that viewing certain financial results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates facilitates period to period comparisons of business performance and provides useful information to investors a significant portion of the company’s advertising operations are conducted in foreign markets principally europe the uk and china and management reviews the results from its foreign operations on a constant dollar basis revenues direct operating and sga expenses and oibdan each excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates are calculated by converting the current period’s amounts in local currency to us dollars using average foreign exchange rates for the prior periodin the first quarter of  the company sold nine nonstrategic americas outdoor markets in the second quarter of  the company sold its business in turkey and in the fourth quarter of  the company sold its business in australia in the first quarter of  the company sold its indianapolis market the company presents revenues direct operating and sga expenses and oibdan each excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates and the results from outdoor markets and businesses sold for the consolidated company and the americas and international outdoor segments in order to facilitate investors’ understanding of operational trends without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates and without the results from the outdoor markets and businesses that were sold as these results will not be included in the company’s results in current and future periodsthe company presents revenues excluding the effects of political revenue due to the cyclical nature of the electoral system and the seasonality of the related political revenues management believes presenting revenue excluding the effects of political revenue provides additional information to investors about the company’s revenue growth from period to periodcorporate expenses excluding the effects of noncash compensation expenses and the effects of foreign exchange rates is presented as oibdan excludes noncash compensation expensessince these nongaap financial measures are not calculated in accordance
