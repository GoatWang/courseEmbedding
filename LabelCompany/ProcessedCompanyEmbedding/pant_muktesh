online why huggies thank you for making the best diapers around  huggies is my absolute favorite brand for my two little ladies no leaks  zero rashes  we♡ huggies jennifer sonnenberg oct   see all real mom testimonials the inside of it honest to goodness when i opened these up and i felt the liner for the first time i was in shock i have never in my life felt a diaper as absorbent as soft cuddly as this and i have several children and i have gone through a lot of diapers a lot of different diaper brands changed a lot of diapers and i have like i said other than a cloth diaper this is the softest one ive ever felt these are the little bumps the little pillows this is the liner and it is so soft i cant say that enough it really truly is its so gentle against your babys skin i have found that these diapers wick away the moisture really really well and keep my babys skin really dry and protected melissa l dec   see all real mom testimonials having  children still in diapers huggies little movers are simply my favorite diaper by far my kids are constantly playing and exploring and arent wetting themselves as often as they did a yr ago but the gel beads that form when the diaper is ready to be changed is simply genius the children can play n play without rashes diapers falling apart or wetting their clothes it saves on diaper creams changing them every  hrs depending on how much they had to drink and on wet clothing because of leaks we only buy huggies diapers because we save in the long run when we compare the cheaper diapers and how often we have to change them or put on a new outfit because other brands dont hold up as well finding the right diaper for the price took some trial n error but i wouldnt use any other brand since we tried huggies siss oct   see all real mom testimonials i am so happy that these diapers exist my baby couldnt be more comfortable she is always smiling and sleeps well through the night and her diaper is never soaking  i am so glad that they have all sizes because i will keep using these only juanita nov   see all real mom testimonials we use them only you know for diaper changes but for a lot of other purposes like face cleaning and hand wiping and what i love about them is theyre extremely tough they basically leave the skin extremely soft and theyre not irritating they had aloe in it which helps with any irritation

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
