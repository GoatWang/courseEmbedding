mild sedative the thin and deflated orbera™ balloon is placed into the stomach it is then filled with saline until it’s about the size of a grapefruit the procedure typically takes about  to  minutes and the patient can generally go home the same day at six months through another nonsurgical procedure done under a mild sedative the orbera™ balloon is deflated and then removed once the balloon is in place the patient receives an individually tailored support program through the orberatm managed weight loss system team of experts  which may include a dietician psychologist and exercise physiologist  to help keep them motivated coordinate their program and help them work through weight loss barriers to meet their longterm weight loss goals coaching takes place over  months even
