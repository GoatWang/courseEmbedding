evasionâ€•and to battle financial crises by tapping the power of negative interest ratesthe world is drowning in cashâ€•and its making us poorer and less safe in the curse of cash kenneth rogoff one of the world’s leading economists makes a persuasive and fascinating case for an idea that until recently would have seemed outlandish getting rid of most paper moneyeven as people in advanced economies are using less paper money there is more cash in circulationâ€•a record  trillion in us dollars alone or  for every american mostly in  bills and the united states is hardly exceptional so what is all that cash being used for the answer is simple a large part is feeding tax evasion corruption terrorism the drug trade human trafficking and the rest of a massive global underground economyas rogoff shows paper money can also cripple monetary policy in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis central banks have been unable to stimulate growth and inflation by cutting interest rates significantly below zero for fear that it would drive investors to abandon treasury bills and stockpile cash this constraint has paralyzed monetary policy in virtually every advanced economy and is likely to be a recurring problem in the futurethe curse of cash offers a plan for phasing out most paper moneyâ€•while leaving smalldenomination bills and coins in circulation indefinitelyâ€•and addresses the issues the transition will pose ranging from fears about privacy and price stability to the need to provide subsidized debit cards for the poorwhile phasing out the bulk of paper money will hardly solve the world’s problems it would be a significant step toward addressing a surprising number of very big ones provocative engaging and backed by compelling original arguments and

baldwin sebastian mallaby rana foroohar txt customer reviews most helpful customer reviews  of  people found the following review helpful orwell is laughing by w willers in the mind of an economic tyrant banning cash represents the holy grail michael kruegerit is difficult to think that anyone intelligent enough to be a chess grandmaster would fail to see that going cashless would be the last brick in the government’s wall of absolute control over the masses anyone who might irritate the government in any way however minor could have accounts frozen leaving the individual absolutely naked unable to access the means to purchase food or shelter or anything else this has already happened to four drone pilots who have been critical of the us drone program see the link and follow its links for a short education in an orwellian nightmarerogoff states page  the importance of “separating out protection from government snooping” while he knows that would be impossible… a fact he essentially admits to on page  a main argument for cashless society is that it gives government the power to inflict negative interest rates and bailins in a climate in which citizens are disallowed the option of converting to cash but he admits page  that negative interest rate policy is still theoretical with unknown drawbacks such as price and financial instabilitycitizens in his cashless world would not even be able to make a five dollar persontoperson exchange without it being an electronic record rogoff even admits that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin created to make for anonymity would be overcome by government which could use “other pieces of information to … pull out identities”the fact that cash “handcuffs central banks” in their goal of total control of society and even though the lack of cash might aid in fighting tax dodging and other crimes the right to privacy trumps it all i am heartened to see that the overwhelming majority of commenters re this book understand the orwellian implications of an purely electronic world  of  people found the following review helpful the final nail in the coffin of freedom by reveres heir first i will say that i am a financial advisor for  years having been trained in economics i give seminars that teach about our monetary system and the history of money i have the utmost respect for ken rogoff and thought that the work that he did with carmen reinhart this time is different was eyeopening in studying the prior instances of excessive debt throughout world history if youd like to understand why inflation is the route chosen to deal with a debt crisis over and over again throughout history take the time to read that tomethis book on the other hand you should read to better understand the threat that those in power have in mind for you in the curse of cash sadly rogoff is an apologist for the state i would begin my review asking a simple question  since when are central banks engaged in responsible for fighting crime at the very least this is yet one more instance of mission creep for the federal reserve beyond its original mandate having already taken on the responsibility of managing the global economythe curse of cash is an argument for why the state should have more ability to control our medium of exchange at negative real interest rates let alone nominal interest rates it can hardly any longer be called a store of value he begins his argument by listing the litany of illicit uses for cash including tax evasion drugs corruption of our otherwise pure politicians human trafficking exploitation of migrants illegal immigration counterfeiting terrorism and polishes his argument off with the fact that cash can harbor germs the arguments presented can easily be demolished by the fact that except for the disease argument gold would be a better form of payment to facilitate these illicit transactions ironically a ban on cash might bolster the sale and the value of gold for these purposesall of his arguments decry the loss to government of tax revenues seigniorage and overall control of our money he argues for greater ability for the government to tax and to impose negative interest rates on the population there is no transaction that cannot be taxed no financial exchange that cannot be controlled i would like readers to think about a world where all of your transactions are handled via debit credit card and where your singlepayer healthcare provider can see that youve eaten just a few too many candy bars this month and maybe your health insurance premiums should be adjustedif paying the kid next door to cut your lawn would you have to issue him a form at the end of the transaction would he need to be able to accept electronic payments to even be able to perform the service one can easily see how the larger companies would gain even more of the business to be had in the overall economy then only those companies that play nice would be rewarded with easy terms of business we are already beginning to see companies around the country ie gun stores medical marijuana etc that dont toe the government line being punished by being pushed out of banking serviceswe all should understand this threat and make sure that when we vote we elect honorable people who have no desire to control and tax our every financial transaction it will be the end of our freedom  of  people found the following review helpful this is not a book to be tossed aside lightly  it should be hurled with great force by james e mitchell seriously yes criminals use cash but without cash all transactions between consenting adults can only occur at the pleasure of financial gatekeepers this books an apologia for the most corrupt rentseeking scheme imaginable literally destroying the universal freedom to transact under the false flag of catching the small percentage of folks who abuse this freedom in service of criminality see all  customer reviews free the curse of cash by
