analyzed including the relation between streak camera and fabryperot interferometer data the   and  mm scaled displacements are modified to represent average relative volumes of   and  cheetah v is introduced with its new allhugoniot calibration which produces the most accurate detonation energies to date using cheetah v energies at the three cylinder volumes we find that  cylinder shots show full burn of these  are taken as standards with an error of ±  another  show higher energies which cannot be explained finally  shots show lower energies and these are taken to represent slow kinetics the composite explosive pbxn is taken as a special problem because unconfined and confined size effect data plus two differentsize cylinder tests have been done the form of jwl with one fullyreacted jwl as copied from ignition  growth failed to fit the data the two rate constants interact too strongly so that the form works for   cylinder energies but not for the   found in pbxn we therefore constructed a jwl form with the first fast rate describing the detonation velocity and the second slow rate the cylinder energies this form of jwl isolates the rate constants and works for slowreacting explosives the simple form of jwl allows the fast and slow rates to be estimated directly from the data the gurney velocity divided by the detonation velocity for the standard explosives
