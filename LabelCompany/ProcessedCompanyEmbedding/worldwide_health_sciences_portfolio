commentary a word on the markets as of mar   global equity markets delivered solid gains in the first quarter of  despite a pullback by us stocks late in the period amid dimming prospects for president donald trumps probusiness agenda us stocks advanced for much of the period extending the rally that began with president trumps election in november responding to continued economic growth the us federal reserve the fed raised its benchmark interest rate in march and indicated that further rate hikes would be coming in taking the fed action as a vote of confidence in the us economy stocks rose following the rate hike bank stocks led the advance on expectations that bank earnings would benefit from higher rates stron g manufacturing and jobs data also boosted equity markets during february the us added  new jobs topping forecasts while the unemployment rate remained steady at  but us stocks reversed course after president trumps health care bill was withdrawn from congress the health care failure raised concerns about the prospects for the presidents future economic initiatives including tax reduction and infrastructure s pending equities recouped some of the lost ground in the final days of the threemonth period globally signs of economic gains across a broad spectrum of regions encouraged investors during the period in asia rising demand for semiconductors and other electronics boosted growth in the regions exportoriented economies in europe positive eco nomic data and receding political risks helped push stocks higher even countries longmired in recession such as russia and brazil showed signs of recovery during the periodthe msci world index finished the quarter up  driven by str ong returns across the majority of sectors ten of the  index sectors posted positive returns for the quarter led by information technology and healthcare while energy was the lone negativeperforming sector performance summary  for the first quarter of  the worldwide health sciences fund class a shares outperformed the msci world healthcare index the index returning  at nav vs  for the index healthcare is off to a strong start in  with all index subindustries posting positive returns for the first quarter the health care sectors positive performance was driven by a number of factors including strong earnings releases from major heal th care companies new drug approvals positive clinical trial results coming out of the biotechnology industry and a stall in the presidents health care agenda in congress health care technology was the bestperforming industry followed by life science tools and equipment and suppliers health care providers and services lagged for the quarter both stock selection and industry positioning relative to the index were positive influences on fund performance for the first quarter the funds overweight to the united states was additive to performance as the us outperformed much of the world during the quarter additionally the funds underweight to japan and overweight to belgium aided relative returns historical returns as of mar   annualized  mo  mos ytd  yr  yrs  yrs  yrs fund at nav        fund

funds performance include stock selection was strong for the quarter most notably in health care equipment and suppliers and pharmaceuticals the funds relative underweight to health care providers and services as well as positive stock selection within the industry boosted returns for the quarter the top contributor from a stock selection standpoint for the first quarter was wright medical group a maker of joint implants and bone graft substitutes the company reported higherthanexpected revenues and investors are optimistic about the company s robust pipeline within biotech incyte corporation a biopharma company which focuses on oncology and autoimmune diseases remained a topcontributor to fund performance vertex pharmaceuticals was a positive contributor as well as the company published positive result s for one of its latestage cystic fibrosis drugs additional contributors included health care equipment company intuitive surgical inc and pharmaceutical companies eli lilly and japanese ophthalmic drug maker santen pharmaceuticals detractors  negative contributors for the funds performance include stock selection within biotechnology was a detractor to the funds relative performance although somewhat offset by the funds overweight relative to the industry the funds relative performance was also hindered by an underweight to life sciences and tools as well as negative stock selection for the quarter within the industry stock detractors for the quarter included pharma companies zoetis inc which reported somewhat mixed fourth quarter revenue results and bristolmyers squibb which had announced in early january news that accelerated approval for their lung cancer drug would not be sought additionally biotech company alexion pharmaceuticals detracted from fund performance as investors remain cautious on the name after the recent management changes investment outlook and fund positioning  the overall health care sector has been stuck in a range since mid after a strong multiyear rally we think that within the broader sector specific industries such as pharmaceuticals and biotech are offering value in fact both industries are tra ding on the lower end of their historical valuation ranges in terms of pricetoearnings pe ratios with the first attempt of the repeal of the affordable care act aca failing we are watching for either a congressional pivot toward tax reform or one last push to address healthcare reform as the political spotlight slowly shifts away from healthcare  we can get back to fundamentals within the overall sector were looking for innovation we favor companies that deliver strong returns on capital and companies that have a very solid competitive advantage among these companies there are some amazing things going on right now in rese arch and development rd for the past  years oncology companies have been trying to move away from chemotherapy to develop targeted therapies that go right after tumors now companies like bristol myers roche and merck are actually trying to harn ess the human immune system to target tumors we continue to believe there will always be a market for innovative solutions to the worlds
