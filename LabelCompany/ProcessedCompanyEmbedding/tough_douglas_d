the call back over to me for a balance of year outlook and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions turning to the second quarter  our local currency sales growth this quarter was  as a reminder our overall growth includes a percentage point of growth related to aromor we are comparing to strong likeforlike growth of  in the second quarter of  supported by a high level of growth in both business units this quarter our fragrances business delivered growth of  which includes  percentage points of growth from aromor our flavors business up against a very challenging comparability period of  delivered growth of  this year growth was again void by a healthy level of new wins which is indicative of the companys emphasis on innovation and technology and the work we are doing with our customers to deliver superior products that will delight their consumers wherever they may be the emerging markets which comprise  of our sales continued to outpace the developed markets with midsingledigit growth of  we saw some softening this quarter in the developed markets which contracted  it is worth highlighting that we achieved highsingle digit and even doubledigit growth in many of the emerging market countries including indonesia china india and argentina along with solid growth in brazil and russia looking at our growth on a year basis our overall growth was  comprised of  in flavors and  growth in fragrances including aromor this growth is within our longterm targeted growth range our profitability remains solid the companys gross profit margin improved  basis points versus the prior year and reflects our ninth consecutive quarter of yearoveryear gross profit margin improvements this quarters improvement was primarily due to ongoing cost improvement initiatives the net impact of price to input costs and favorable currency impacts in certain markets due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to emerging market currencies our adjusted operating profit increased  reflecting the benefits of margin expansion and lower incentive compensation accruals versus the high yearago levels which reduced our overall cost structure the results of aromor were not significant to our consolidated financial performance notably this quarter our adjusted earnings per share increased  to  eps benefited from excellent organic profit results a lower tax rate reduced interest expense foreign exchange gains on working capital and a slight reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to our share buyback program in summary we continue to deliver strong profitability metrics above our longterm targets even with moderate sales growth it is important to note that  quarter is not indicative of a year our second quarter top line growth of  was weakerthanexpected that said i remind you that we had a very strong first quarter with local currency sales growth of  and adjusted operating and eps growth of  and  respectively all metrics above our longterm targets lets review our first half of the year results our local currency sales growth was  comprised of  growth in fragrance and  growth in flavors the  growth is within our longterm targets on a yeartodate basis our profitably metrics are above our longterm growth targets adjusted operating profit increased  during the first half of  this was driven by significant gross margin expansion of  basis points primarily due to cost savings initiatives as well as the benefit of net price to input costs and reduced incentive compensation accruals versus higher yearago levels our input costs continue to remain at elevated levels adjusted operating profit growth was supported by increased segment profit in both business units our adjusted earnings per share grew  in the first half of  the doubledigit growth in our adjusted eps reflects our expanded growth in operating margins lower interest expenses as a result of refinancing and the benefits of our share repurchase program as well as favorable trends on foreign exchange so far this year of note our operating and earnings per share profitability growth metrics are above our longterm growth targets i would now like to turn the call over to nicolas and matthias so they can provide more detail on their respective units nicolas nicolas mirzayantz thank you doug good morning and good afternoon everyone turning to our fragrance business units fragrance had local currency sales growth of  this quarter compared with  growth in the second quarter of  which was our highest growth quarter last year our  growth includes approximately  percentage points of growth from our aromor acquisition we said are captured in fragrance ingredients on a year basis excluding aromor our sales growth is also  which compares quite well with our longterm growth targets this quarter the emerging markets grew at  or twice the rate of our developed markets and represented  of our fragrance compounds sales we achieved strong growth in the emerging markets of china indonesia and brazil which is one of our strongest fragrance markets and where we have a leadership position our overall sales performance was a result of a strong pipeline of new wins in our compounds business which includes both our fine fragrances and consumer fragrances enduse categories fine fragrances grew  in both latin america and greater asia this growth was offset by declines in our eame region due to customer order patterns let me remind you that yeartodate sales in the eame increased  north america was flat this quarter compared with a  growth in the yearago quarter that said north america grew by  for the first  months of  although our overall fine fragrance category was flat this quarter on a year basis fine fragrances had growth of  which is above our longterm targets endmarket performance turning to consumer fragrances this category had solid growth of  compared with  growth in the prior year quarter growth this quarter was led by highsingle digit growth in toiletries and midsingledigit growth in fabric care personal wash and home care hair care also grew this quarter north america and asia delivered doubledigit growth and latin america was also positive this was offset by a slight decline in eame turning to our ingredients business fragrance ingredients delivered local currency sales growth of  which includes  of growth from aromor the growth in fragrance ingredients reflect continuous strong sales of key iff product families excluding the planned migration of some volume from fragrance ingredients to compounds fragrance ingredients would have grown by  this quarter marks our final quarter of the planned migration of volume from fragrance ingredients to compounds in summary we achieved solid top line growth thanks to the strength and diversity of our portfolio customer base and enduse categories on a yeartodate basis our fragrance business grew  which includes  percentage points of growth from aromor and is within our longterm targets turning to our profitability we were able to leverage our  local currency sales growth into higher segment operating profit to achieve very strong business unit performance our gross margins benefited from volume gains and productivity savings combined with a favorable impact of pricetoinput cost and currency benefits offset by a small negative mix impact due to the reduced growth in fine fragrance our input costs continue to remain at elevated lead levels the gross margin expansion combined with decreased incentive compensation accruals from the high yearago levels drove an improvement in our segment profit margins these benefits were offset in part by increased rsa spending to support business growth for the quarter our segment profit increased  or an increase of  million yeartodate our segment profit has improved by  million or  here are a few additional areas id like to highlight number one were seeing the impact of some higher raw material costs in our inventories especially in naturals and petrochemicals we expect input cost pressures to impact our pl around the end of the year and to be developing headwind for  we are proactively engaged in pricing discussions with select customers to offset the inflationary pressure number two this quarter we completed the purchase price accounting related to aromor and as a result we will now have a modest ongoing amortization expense in our pl number three as planned this quarter we closed our fragrance ingredients plant in augusta and we will see the cost benefits in h as always our focus is on efficiency and making sure our operations are costeffective and competitive these recent initiatives support our strategic focus to drive improvements in our ingredients business turning to our third quarter outlook for the third quarter were expecting continued top line momentum in the business we expect the rate of improvement in yearoveryear gross margin to moderate in h especially when compared with the improvements we made in gross margins in the first half of  we look forward to updating you next quarter i will now turn the call over to matthias our new group president of flavors matthias haeni good morning and good afternoon everyone against challenging comps of  a year ago flavors delivered local currency sales growth of  in the second quarter of  as a reminder the second quarter of  was our strongest likeforlike quarter of last year new wins which were at historical levels in the second quarter continued to be a growth driver of our business the volume from new wins was offset by a higher level of erosion on existing business especially in north america where we had several very large new product launches in the second quarter of  looking at the  years average flavors had solid growth of  on a likeforlike basis for q the emerging markets continued to drive growth for our business representing  of sales the emerging markets grew by  led by doubledigit growth of  in latin america the bric countries of brazil russia india and china all performed well reflecting our ability to work with both global and local customers in these markets solid growth in the brics was offset by losses in other countries including thailand which was pressured by geopolitical risk on a yeartodate basis we grew by  in the emerging markets with  of our growth coming from these markets from a regional perspective in europe africa and in middle east local currency sales increased by  on top of  growth in the second quarter of  growth was strongest in beverages sweet and dairy partially offset by softness in savory in greater asia this quarter we were disappointed in our flat growth versus  likeforlike growth in the yearago quarter gains in the savory and sweet enduse categories were offset by declines in beverages and dairy in north america the operating environment continues to be challenging volume erosion on existing business was significant and more than offset our growth from new wins as mentioned this was driven by several large product launches last year and we were comparing to growth of  which is the most challenging comp of the year finally we saw continued very strong growth in latin america of  driven by our proprietary technologies in beverages which resulted in very strong growth in the category reflecting a very high level of new wins on a yeartodate basis latin america has grown by  the second quarter is the third consecutive quarter of doubledigit growth in our latin america region turning to our profitability metrics flavors gross margins remained strong at prior year levels as a result of our technologydriven wins and creative capabilities our segment profit improved by  or  million to  million or an increase of  basis points as a percentage of sales the improvement reflects flat gross margins combined with decreased incentive compensation provisions versus the high level of a year ago our input costs continue to remain at elevated levels on a yeartodate basis our segment profit increased  or  million or an increase of  basis points turning to our outlook for the third quarter of  we expect growth to be moderate given the ongoing challenges in north america and western europe we are carefully monitoring the situation yet we remain confident we can continue to leverage our innovation and technology to grow our business i also want to highlight that we have begun to see input cost pressure on some items in our inventory we are expecting to see the increased cost pressures in our pl around the end of the year and we will likely see headwinds in  as a result we have been proactively working with customers on price increases to help mitigate these inflationary pressures as of  our current strategic initiatives and other cost savings should offset any cost increases in  with that i will now turn the call over to kevin our cfo kevin c berryman thank you matthias and good morning and good afternoon everyone id like to turn back to our consolidated results and on the slide you can see that we delivered again strong operating metrics again in the second quarter on a consolidated basis our net sales of  million were up  on a reported basis and also on a local currency basis our consolidated sales includes the results from aromor which added a percentage point to our consolidated growth this quarter fragrances comprised  of our sales and flavors the remaining  our growth was the result of our diversity in terms of regions enduse categories and customers emerging markets grew  this quarter and the developed markets declined by  reflecting a challenging environment in north america for flavors and a slower growth in fine fragrance in western europe during the second quarter our adjusted gross margin this quarter improved by  basis points to  this primarily reflects gross margin expansion in fragrance due to volume gains certainly a result of strong new wins currency benefits as well as the favorable impact of price to input costs and internal improvement initiatives across both business units the strong margin growth combined with lower incentive compensation and favorable currency resulted in an  increase in our adjusted operating profit to  million resulting again in our operating profit margin rising to  up  basis points from the yearago figure of  our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter of  was favorable to our adjusted figure of  in the first quarter of  reflecting higher earnings from lower tax jurisdictions and the effect of favorable tax settlements partially offset by higher repatriation costs and the absence of the rd tax credit in the current quarter the strong operating profit growth when combined with foreign exchange gains lower interest expense and the positive impact on earnings per share of our share repurchase program this resulted in a yearoveryear improvement of  in our indiscernible  importantly the growth in all of our profitability metrics in the second quarter are all at or above our longterm growth targets now that we are halfway into the year i wanted to put things into perspective by looking at our operating performance for the first half of  its important to note that on a yeartodate basis all of our growth targets are in line with or above our longterm growth targets our net sales of  billion increased  on both a reported and local currency basis and of course that includes approximately  percentage point of growth from aromor this is clearly within our longterm growth target of  to  organic growth our adjusted gross margins also increased  basis points to  regarding adjusted operating profit it increased  in the first  months of  reflecting in part lower incentive compensation accruals this equates to  basis point improvement in our operating profit to  finally our adjusted diluted eps increased  to  for the first  months of  ahead of our longterm growth targets turning to our research selling and administrative costs rsa as a percent of sales increased  basis points from  of sales to  of sales or an increase of  million the primary drivers of the increase include aromorrelated cost including operating and amortization and acquisition costs investment in commercial resources to support our pillar strategy currency impacts and several discrete items these higher expenses were partially offset by reduced incentive compensation accruals versus the very high levels in the second quarter of a year ago we remain focused on maintaining cost discipline while investing in rd and other strategic growth opportunities this quarter rd spending was  of sales versus  in the prior year the prior year figure as you may recall includes an initial payment to amyris as well as other investments in research and development importantly our emphasis on rd has resulted in a stronger pipeline of innovation and we continue to invest in our rd platforms and the programs that support them our strong cash flow position and margins provides us with the continued flexibility to do so turning to currency here you see our customary chart showing the change and the strength of the euro relative to the dollar as the movement in the euro represents the large variable relative to currency impact on our results as noted earlier foreign exchange movements had a negligible impact on our top line growth as it relates to our adjusted operating profit and eps results for the quarter yearoveryear currency impacts were positive and at the operating profit line we continue to proactively manage our gross margin profile through our cash flow hedging programs during q we specifically benefited from a stronger us dollar versus several of the emerging market currencies which favorably impacted local expenses finally eps growth also benefited from the absence of foreign exchange losses and working capital which we experienced in the second quarter of  due to the high level of volatility in foreign exchange markets in the second quarter of last year as a reminder the   for  the majority of our euro exposure continues to be hedged at a rate of  close to the full year average of  turning to our cash flow our operating cash flow in the first half of  was  million compared with an operating cash flow of  million in the prior year quarter the prior year cash flow included a  million incremental us pension contribution and the yearoveryear increase reflects the  million improvement in net income partially offset by increased incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of  versus the first quarter of  as a percent of sales the current quarter operating cash flow is  of sales compared with  in the yearago quarter core working capital increased in absolute dollars to support business growth however declined on a percentage of sales basis and is ontrack for targeted improvements that we outlined at the beginning of the year turning to our capital structure capital spending for growth and infrastructure and newer technology continues to be our most important use of cash over the past  years we have been investing approximately  of sales on adding capacity where its needed to optimize our geographic footprint and to ensure that our proprietary technologies are available to our customers around the globe we are also committed to returning capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases yesterday our board of directors authorized a  increase or  in the quarterly dividend to  per share up from the  per share a year ago this dividend is payable on october  to shareholders of record as of september  including this authorization iffs quarterly dividend payment will have grown by a compound annual growth rate of  over the last  years the current authorization importantly reflects the boards confidence in the companys ability to continue to execute on its pillar strategy based on the notable progress weve made in expanding our geographic footprint developing our rd pipeline and improving the margin profile of our portfolio the doubledigit increase in the dividend also reflects our strong cash flow position this enables us to maintain a competitive dividend yield continue to execute against our share buyback program all while maintaining a strong amount of financial flexibility to aggressively explore ma opportunities regarding our share buyback program on a yeartodate basis we have spent approximately  million on share buybacks total program spending since the first quarter of  is  million through the end of the second quarter based on our programmatic share buyback program we continue to expect that we will spend more on share buybacks in  than we did in  finally as noted we continue to evaluate business development opportunities we are targeting those opportunities that would provide us with access to new technology geography or business adjacency that would make strong strategic sense and leverage our expertise in science and technology we have the financial flexibility to invest in both external business development activities as well as our organic growth programs with that ill turn the call back over to doug douglas d tough thank you kevin mathias and nicholas as youve heard from our teams weve had a good first half of the year with local currency sales growth of  and adjusted operating profit and earnings per share growth of  and  respectively all in line with or above our longterm targets as you have heard volume erosion on base business in flavors put pressure on our top line growth despite a level of new wins that was in line with historical norms we expect to see continued erosion in the third quarter in flavors for the third quarter we expect sales growth to be in line with our q results as market conditions for flavors will remain challenging we expect to see continued gross margin expansion but at a lower rate yearoveryear especially as we compare to the improved gross margin performance of the prior year and the improvements we saw in the first half of the year in addition we are closely monitoring the input costs and as mathias and nicolas indicated in their remarks we expect to see some inflationary cost pressure around year end which will have an impact on our  pl as a result we have been proactively working with customers on price increases to help mitigate these inflationary pressures as to  our current strategic initiatives and other cost savings should offset any cost increases in  turning to the full year given our current visibility we now expect our full year local currency sales growth to be in the range of  to  our full year profitability metrics remain intact cost control and manufacturing efficiencies will continue to drive our operating profit growth we are reconfirming our expectation for doubledigit operating profit and earnings per share growth for the full year the investments we are making in rd have resulted in a strong pipeline of innovation we are confident that the commercialization of these technologies will result in continued sales growth and margin gains for the company as most of you know in late may we announced iffs ceo succession plan effective september  i will be stepping down as chief executive officer and will remain active as iffs chairman i have thoroughly enjoyed my time at iff but have always said that at some point i would scale back my involvement to make time for other activities i have just celebrated my th birthday and i am looking forward to doing other things including more time with my family children and grandchildren the board has selected andreas fibig as the next ceo of iff andreas has been a member of our board since  and has been actively involved in setting our strategy and charting a course for the future andreas comes to us from bayer pharmaceutical where he has successfully introduced new pharmaceutical solutions and drove a profitable growth agenda importantly he is known to the board of directors and to our senior management team who value his insight and his input he understands the value of rd and driving the innovation agenda understands and help develop our emerging market strategy and has previous operating experience in the emerging markets finally andreas has a successful track record with merger and acquisitions and will be a great addition to iff as the company looks to further drive its profitable growth strategy both organically and through business development activities we welcome him to iff and look forward to working with him and i look forward to introducing him to many of you here are the key takeaways from our second quarter call in summary our overall growth of  in the second quarter and  yeartodate reflects strong results in fragrances and mixed results in flavors our sales growth slowed in q on account of greater erosion on existing business we expect to see continued erosion in the third quarter in flavors which has led us to reduce our full year top line sales forecast the breadth and diversity of our portfolio provides greater stability to absorb variations in a particular region category or customer we can really see how effective this business model was for us this quarter as our overall growth of  had some great success which offset areas of weakness the second quarter compares to our most challenging quarter in  from a top line growth standpoint we continue to believe strongly in our strategy and longterm growth potential and we are positioning iff for future success our commitment to innovation portfolio enhancement and internal improvements support our strong gross margin profile we remain focused on our  strategic pillars leveraging our geographic footprint enhancing our innovation and maximizing our portfolio i thank you for your participation today on our q earnings call and we will now open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of mark astrachan with stifel nicolaus mark s astrachan  stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division im curious given recent ma in flavors and fragrances and adjacent categories are there still valueaccretive deals for iff and have you had to change the way you define value in terms of looking at that douglas d tough good question mark theres certainly been a recent spate of activity in a couple of areas i think the broader question is are there still opportunities there and we believe the answer to that would be yes conceivably both within the organic footprint but also adjacencies which would leverage off the some of the skills and competencies we have particularly in rd some of the recent price points that have been achieved on a couple of the deals have certainly exceeded previous transactions and that will weigh in on value but i think as weve talked about in our pillar strategy and the opportunities to continue to grow in the emerging markets as that middle class comes forward we think theres still robust opportunity for growth so its not a prerequisite that we have ma activity but we are certainly as kevin pointed out we have the financial firepower to do so if the opportunity presents itself and we remain eager and well evaluate things but you have used a critical word in there which is are there still value opportunities and the economic profit discipline that weve instilled in the company will be germane to all the things we look at and so we will have to have value in order to go forward but were confident there will be opportunities mark s astrachan  stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division got it okay and then just one followup for matthias could you talk maybe a bit more about whats driving flavors erosion is it large customers is it local customers is it specific categories of weakness and maybe even talk about how that flowed through the quarter matthias haeni mark this is matthias speaking as i tried to outline in the call we had a significant erosion particularly in north america in north america we were also up to significant comparables of last year as we have seen a few very large product introductions last year these were seasonal probably more trendy product launches heavily supported by our customers and commercials and we see in our shortfall versus prior year approximately  of our shortfall is driven by a few select products and customers going into q i think we will see some continued softness not only from these introductions and the comparables but also from the market situation which turned to be a bit more challenging and that has also been supported and communicated by many of our customers operator your next question comes from lauren lieberman with barclays capital lauren r lieberman  barclays capital research division i did just want to followup i guess first on asia youve mentioned specifically that china and india were still quite strong thailand being the source of weakness but just for the math to work i mean thailand is about i think  of company sales which just seems like there may have been something else that was a drag maybe it was a collection of things but a little bit more color there would be really helpful nicolas mirzayantz lauren this is matthias speaking again thank you for your question i really tried to outline in asia we had seen a mixed picture we had seen china india grow strongly and we have seen some challenges in southeast asia not only thailand which is very much impacted by geopolitical situations and unfavorable market situations we have also seen some challenges in indonesia in the second quarter however i would like to remind in the first quarter in indonesia we had very strong doubledigit growth and we expect to see a normalized pattern going forward lauren r lieberman  barclays capital research division okay and then overall at least in the way that i was modeling the quarter north america actually was a little better than i expected it was really eame that kind of stood out as weakerthanexpected at least as far as western europe goes a lot of your customers at least the publicly traded ones have been talking about things maybe seeming a little bit better from a consumer standpoint there so if maybe we could get a little bit of color on both flavors and fragrances what youre seeing in western europe and if the sources of weakness there was more developed or developing markets matthias haeni this is matthias again in western europe we experienced some of the challenges i think its not acrosstheboard it is in a few  with a few select customers we keep on winning thanks to our technology program in particular where we helped customers to reduce calories in products but also to reduce sodium we have a strong approach to pipeline but as i outlined we see some challenges relative to erosion of the business nicolas do you maybe want to add something nicolas mirzayantz lauren its nicolas here i will separate obviously the trend in fine fragrance in the consumer goods as you saw we had a very strong q in fine fragrance of plus  i think its more related to order patterns which had affected our performance in q so overall  growth for the first  months which is above market performance so i think that its there but  we obviously watch out the overall environment and the economic situation when i look at consumer fragrances we have seen some pocket obviously of instability in the region especially middle east africa but also eastern europe which is impacting the demands on our customers affecting consumer demand which has created some pocket of headwinds so were seeing some improvement as our customers are mentioning would it be a meaningful improvement i dont expect so but at least we will see some improvement so its really a mixed performance according to the countries or subregion that youre talking about operator your next question comes from mike sison with keybanc michael j sison  keybanc capital markets inc research division in terms of your outlook for  from doubledigit eps growth you dont really need a lot of growth in the second half to get there can you maybe give us a little bit of help of how you see the second half i know you dont like to give guidance on a quarterly basis but are you implying that maybe the second half isnt double digits because your first half was pretty impressive kevin c berryman mike this is kevin ill make just a few comments we dont imply anything as it relates to what the second half of the business actually looks like in terms of performance level but i think the mere fact that we are calling for strong doubledigit growth in both operating profit and the eps i think is indicative that again we feel that our second half of the year is going to warrant good performance at the end of day we do have as outlined kind of a reduction from what we would have originally said on the top line we had a  to  range now were a  to  that doesnt mean anything other than probably the high end of our range before is probably unlikely now and so consequently we continue to believe that we have a good second half of the year michael j sison  keybanc capital markets inc research division right great and then a quick question on fine fragrances latin america still seems to be an area that continues to do well ive heard brazil is kind of a sore spot for some folks any worries there that that business will slow down or do you have a pretty good backlog of new products to keep that momentum going as we head into the second half of the year nicolas mirzayantz mike its nicolas again as you know last year we had a very strong first half where we grew  which was far above the market performance here you saw that after some challenge but it was mostly due to strong comp minus  in q versus plus  last year we have a lag on new good growth  above  last year so we have a good strong pipeline of new wins but it is fair to say that across categories brazil has faced some slower growth rate across customers and product categories so our pipeline of new wins is strong and now it will be  we have to see other market and the consumer demand will develop in the next few months but our performance related to the market is strong now well have to see what will be the impact of overall consumer demand michael j sison  keybanc capital markets inc research division okay great and one quick one in north america flavors in terms of the market sentiment are customers opting not to launch as many new products as we head into the second half of the year or is it maybe some attrition of the base business thats maybe going away faster than you would have thought matthias haeni this is matthias speaking frankly i cannot tell what our customers are going to launch in the second half of this year i can tell you that we have a strong project pipeline our commercial performance which means the wins are in line with historical levels yet still need the pressure on a few select customers and volume remains strong and we firmly believe we have the ability to win we have a significant project pipeline a very strong innovation pipeline that will make a significant difference which is a lasting difference for our customers and iff douglas d tough now this is just an augmentation to what matthias is talking through if you look at the top line in the second quarter you  our growth from the new wins continue to be very solid where we saw the weakness as matthias outlined really is more flavorsspecific and its the erosion on existing business which matthias has already outlined and some of that is associated with some discrete items on specific customers so there is some other general erosion that weve seen in flavors but the thing that is most important and what were driving relative to our innovation programs continues to be robust and we see that pipeline being  continuing to look pretty solid operator your next question comes from jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan silke kueckvaldes  jp morgan chase  co research division its silke kueck for jeff i was wondering if you can indicate how much of the gross margin contribution this quarter came from volume price mix and how much may have been from a favorable pricing over raw materials kevin c berryman we havent disclosed that information silke but ultimately we had drivers of volume mix because of the amount of our growth was more limited this quarter and especially as a nicolas outlined mix was not as positive as it normally is because of the fine fragrance situation that he suggested but we saw good cost reduction initiatives we saw some benefits on net pricing and there was some currency all were adding up to be some positives as it relates to the gross margin silke kueckvaldes  jp morgan chase  co research division okay and in terms of the savings that you expect going forward there are the benefits from the plant closure in augusta and my recollection is that was on an annual basis maybe to deliver something like  million to  million do you think you may be able to get half of that in the second half and what was the effect of the amortization expenses from aromor that are falling away kevin c berryman the  a couple of things the  million to  million is still the expectation on an annual basis so we would expect given the timing of the closure that we will get roughly half of that most of the costs as it relates to the acquisition which well refer to are really relative to the amortization cost so those will be ongoing regardless the net impact to aromor on a total basis is immaterial within the context of the profitability of the company silke kueckvaldes  jp morgan chase  co research division okay and then lastly i guess ultimately just like to revisit the north american flavors issue one more time so the comparisons are really  in north american flavors were very difficult and i agree your commentary wasnt different than what your competitors said though in the second half the comparisons are becoming noticeably easier and so one of the question is will you  is there  more quarter of headwinds because theres something customerspecific or is it going to be  or  more quarters of headwinds matthias haeni well i thank you for your question we will see continued softness in the third quarter in north america you are right we see ease  comparisons easing in the fourth quarter and we also expect the third quarter to improve relative to our second quarter performance in north america flavors operator your next question comes from the line of rohini baza ph with deutsche bank rohini nair  deutsche bank ag research division rohini nair from deutsche bank doug wishing you all the best as you move on to the next adventure a few more questions for me on north america flavors i guess id just love to understand whether you are actively taking any steps towards stemming this volume erosion that youre talking about or is it just that you eventually anticipate an improvement in the consumer environment along with that what are you seeing from those specific challenged customers that you think they can improve on is it that their new product development is really not up to par are they not managing their inventories correctly itd just be great to have your thoughts around that matthias haeni i think in north america as we see some pressure overall in the market we see more and more customers also being very cautious in product launches and cautiousness is often the result of the seasonal launches and if the seasonal launch is not going to be a big success they will take it off the market i think we see and well see continued situations in north america where very large customers are bringing a socalled limited time offerings to the market we see it in many of the categories and if this limited time offerings are not very strongly supported by commercials and marketing advertisements you will see erosion quickly now im confident that with the project pipeline which we have and what we are working with our customers we are working much more on iconic brands again brands which are in the marketplace for quite some time extensions of brands which will stay for a longer period of time and it remains to be seen what we will get as new product launches in the fourth quarter we have some visibility on the third one and we feel confident as for the fourth and beyond we will see what type of dynamics we are going to experience douglas d tough i would just want to build on something matthias said which is in the context of what are the actions being taken and theres probably a couple theres obviously a financial discipline associated with cost and investments but we actually see some significant opportunities in the north american market particularly with some customers so both account management and focus on innovation as well as opening of offices to support these customers thats actually on our horizon because of the confidence we have in the innovation pipeline so theres as much if not more offensivebased activities as they are defensive in terms of returning the business in north america to growth silke kueckvaldes  jp morgan chase  co research division thats helpful if i could have just one quick followup those categories that youre seeing that are weak is it basically acrosstheboard sweet savory dairy beverage or are you seeing it more concentrated matthias haeni i think it is more concentrated towards savory and beverages and we keep on making very good inroads in other categories i  the isolated cases i was referring to from last year theyre in probably  categories only and this is mainly related to beverages operator your next question comes from jonathan feeney with athlos research jonathan patrick feeney  athlos research llc just one question i had with some of the pressures in developed markets flavors business specifically whats the competitive landscape end like has there been an uptick in bid activity or in competitive shuffling as presumably your competitors in flavors are feeling some of the trends youre feeling right now and to the extent you could mention the pricing environment as it relates to that competitive activity id appreciate it matthias haeni i think the  i tried to outline  we see some pressure in north america we see some pressure in western europe nevertheless given our opportunity and ability coupled with the very strong project pipeline and our innovation programs we are obviously  these opportunities materializing for us very positively going forward we have a lot offer to our customers and what our offering is not only adding great flavors in our offering we also are in the position to add taste to products and with taste we are also at the same time engineering together with customers on lowercost recipes for their own consumers so overall im very confident that we see opportunities in both in the developed markets but also in the developing markets and our growth and model and growth thesis remains strong and we have a very sound solid foundation in the flavors business unit operator your next question comes from edward yang edward h yang  oppenheimer  co inc research division a question on pricing and raw materials what percentage type of price increases do you need from your customers to offset some of the raw material prices  pressures youre seeing kevin c berryman ed this is kevin we havent disclosed that and as you know at the end of the year when we talk to our q results well give a perspective on what the expected inflation levels are and that may give you a better indication as to what kind of pricing may be required to help offset that pressure but at the end of the day we dont believe that were faced  just to make a few comments we dont believe were faced with the situation back in  where we had doubledigit input cost but we do fundamentally believe that there are areas where were going to have to take pricing to help offset input cost pressure beginning in  so well talk more about that at the end of the year during our q call but not to be an alarmist theres no need for us to be thinking along the lines of what would have happened in  your competitors will also i would assume be taking the same kind of positions because theyll be interested in trying to recover some of the input cost pressures they would see as well edward h yang  oppenheimer  co inc research division got it and thats helpful kevin and along that vein im still  i am surprised that you are talking about raw material pressures because in general it doesnt seem like the raw environment or the commodity environment is necessarily very heated right now raw material price pressures are they driven by capacity reductions in certain areas or drought because i dont really see energy prices up all that much and are there any offsets  you mentioned naturals as the place where youre seeing raw material pressures but in synthetics are you seeing price declines to offset some of those pressures kevin c berryman i think that youre right the good thing about the diversity of our spend is that theres often times pieces of the portfolio that will go up and its often times offset to at least to some extent by other pieces of the portfolio that will go down i would say the one area and youve already outlined it which we expect to in general have higher levels is in the naturals area weve already called out in the past citrus as one particular area where we know that theres going to be some increases versus our current levels and theres a few others but in general the majority of the pressure points are seen in the naturals area there would be some others in the fragrance ingredients side but ultimately its more in the naturals area at this particular point in time and thats where we are focusing most of our discussions with our customers right now in terms of those future price increases operator our next question comes from sarah donnelly with gabelli  co sarah donnelly  g research inc i just wanted to ask about some of the weakness which you mentioned in savory and beverages can you just talk a little bit about demand and the technology you have around sodium and sugar substitution and whether that continues to drive demand around new product or project  your new product pipeline in north america and how its impacting it globally matthias haeni yes sarah this is matthias again i mentioned before in north america we have seen pressure on few select customers so its not across the savory market or its not across the beverage market where we have seen pressure are product introductions that were very trendy very fashionable heavily supported last year and also we have seen our customers building up inventory for such a significant launch and this is why we are also coming under pressure relative to last years performance coming into the project pipeline i mentioned to you before we have a very strong project pipeline in both of what youve described in sodium as well as in sweetness or in calorie reduction we are very active actively engaged with our customers with large global accounts as well as with regional accounts to take calories out of recipes not only in beverages but also in other product offerings in other categories and we got very positive response and our win rate typically is significantly higher once we can allocate technology into the recipe design with our customers operator your next question is a followup question from mark astrachan mark s astrachan  stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division i wanted to go back to the earlier ma question curious how you would describe your customers reception to your competitors to do more business with those that have engaged in ma and sort of adjacent categories and offering more of a onestop shop so in other words you go beyond flavors and fragrances are customers more or less willing to engage with them and how do they sort of think about things broadly their reception to those deals douglas d tough well its a broad question mark and maybe ill take the first swing at it and then matthias can weigh in with some second thoughts it seems to be a bit of a mixed bag some  there will be a certain degree of receptivity from some customers probably smaller ones who are looking for a onestop shop but almost to the contrary some of the other larger ones have unbundled things and arent necessarily looking for that opportunity for a onestop shop and as i say to the country actually going the other direction so i think its certainly early to tell some companies have that as their business model its not the iff business model that would be the onestop shop matthias do you want to say anything matthias haeni i can echo what doug outlined i think mediumsized or probably smallsized companies they will appreciate a total product offering it helps them in the facilitation of their recipe engineering recipe design and they also got a lot of probably additional technical advices from companies offering a total solution when it comes to larger and above all global accounts they would typically ask you mark to unbundle your total solutions and systems as they want to have control over individual ingredients and there will be very limited appreciation for what we think is the total solution for it it may change from account to account but if you want the experience then this is what we are working with our customers on operator and there are no further questions at this time i would now turn the call back over to doug douglas d
