when commissioned officers of other us military services became eligible for membership the company opened offices in frankfurt germany and london england early in its history the company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five united states army officers on june   at the gunter hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance usaa is headquartered in northwest san antonio texas occupying  acres  ha a former horse farm in the largest singleoccupancy office building in the world exceeding the size of the pentagon usaa is a pioneer of the concept of direct

transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were launched in  via its website the organization started offering homeowners and life insurance in the s and brokerage and investment management services in the s and banking services in the s usaa offered restricted membership to civilians between september  and august  this

renters insurance as well as umbrella and personal property insurance in addition to pc insurance usaa provides whole life insurance term life insurance and annuities usaas life insurance policies while not completely unique in the industry are different from most offerings since they do not include a warexclusion clause bankingedit banking services are provided by usaa federal savings bank the bank was established on december   according to usaas  annual report to members usaa held over  billion in deposits with more than  million accounts making the company the th largest bank in the world usaa federal savings banks bank lobby located in san antonio is its only fullservice banking location other cities however hold financial centers often near military bases which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by usaa in addition to opening those accounts online banking services can be accessed in person by mail by phone or through the internet usaa federal savings bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the apple iphone and ipad mobile devices with googles android operating system and microsofts windows phone usaa was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the apple iphone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely

usaa provides brokerage services and noload mutual funds mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers as usaas capacity for taking on new members expanded eligibility criteria relaxed in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers of the top ten automobile insurance competitors usaa is the only provider that restricts service to members of the united states military and their immediate families legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the subscribers account belongs to the member but is not completely distributed until approximately  months after the member no longer has a usaa pc policy in  usaa returned  billion to its members those not eligible to join usaa but who are eligible to purchase insurance from usaas subsidiaries such as usaacic may receive dividends as declared by usaa miscellaneous informationedit usaas colorado springs location besides its headquarters in san antonio usaa has a second major office in phoenix az and other operations in colorado springs co norfolk va tampa fl highland falls ny london england frankfurt germany and plano tx as of  usaa has expanded its bitcoin integration to all members leadershipedit led by usaa chairman of the board gen lester lyles usaf ret usaa’s board of directors named stuart parker ceoelect in august  to succeed former ceo joe robles after his retirement in february  parker became ceo in march  and is a former usaf officer he has been with usaa since  serving in various leadership positions including chief operating officer coo and cfo he has been with usaa since  serving in various positions including chief operating officer coo and cfo carl liebert succeeded parker as coo after serving as usaa capital corporation president carl liebert is a former us navy officer and joined the usaa management team in  usaa experienced much growth under its former ceo retired air force brigadier general robert f mcdermott the usaa building was constructed under his tenure and mcdermott was behind usaas shift from servicebymail to servicebyphone he was succeeded as ceo by retired air force general robert herres it was under herres that usaa expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed internet based financial services following general herres as ceo was robert g davis a former army officer who came to usaa with experience in a variety of financial services companies davis is said to have changed the culture at usaa during his time at usaa membership assets and net worth grew significantly his tenure however was not without controversy davis oversaw usaas first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership davis had indicated to usaa employees that he intended to continue to lead usaa until  however he retired in december  the nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous as usaa ceo josue robles has stated that upon assuming the role of ceo i thought i was just going to be a temporary ceo and the board said guess what the permanent ceo is you oversightedit usaa is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the us securities and exchange commissionclarification needed federal trade commission office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation its records are audited by ernst  young as well as the major financial rating agencies who rate both usaa and many of its subsidiariescitation needed service ratingsedit usaa has consistently received the highest customer service

past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national

quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers as usaas capacity for taking on new members expanded eligibility criteria relaxed in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all

insurance competitors usaa is the only provider that restricts service to members of the united states military and their immediate families legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows

past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national

insurance competitors usaa is the only provider that restricts service to members of the united states military and their immediate families legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us

but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the

including a texas department of insurance regulated reciprocal interinsurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking investing and insurance to people and families that serve or served in the united states military at the end of  there were  million members usaa was founded in  in san antonio texas by a group of  us army officers as a mechanism for mutual selfinsurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they as military officers were a highrisk group usaa has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the armed forces officers and enlisted and their immediate families the company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employeescitation needed instead of agents contents  history  lines of business  property casualty and life insurance  banking  investing and financial planning  target market  legal structure  returning profits to the insured  miscellaneous information  leadership  oversight  service ratings  employment  see also  references  external links historyedit the organization was originally called the united states army automobile association in  the name was changed to united services automobile association when commissioned officers of other us military services became eligible for membership the company opened offices in frankfurt germany and london england early in its history the company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five united states army officers on june   at the gunter hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance usaa is headquartered in northwest san antonio texas occupying  acres  ha a former horse farm in the largest singleoccupancy office building in the world exceeding the size of the pentagon usaa is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing most of its business is conducted over the internet or telephone using employees instead of agents until the s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail in the late s usaa began a transition from mail to phonebased sales and service a tollfree number was launched in  and internet sales and service were launched in  via its website the organization started offering homeowners and life insurance in the s and brokerage and investment management services in the s and banking services in the s usaa offered restricted membership to civilians between september  and august  this membership provided access to usaa’s investment products most bank deposit products and life insurance auto and property insurance policies were not included for nonmilitary members due to eligibility restrictions lines of businessedit property casualty and life insuranceedit usaa offers a range of personal property and casualty pc insurance including automobile insurance homeowner insurance renters insurance as well as umbrella and personal property insurance in addition to pc insurance usaa provides whole life insurance term life insurance and annuities usaas life insurance policies while not completely unique in the industry are different from most offerings since they do not include a warexclusion clause bankingedit banking services are provided by usaa federal savings bank the bank was established on december   according to usaas  annual report to members usaa held over  billion in deposits with more than  million accounts making the company the th largest bank in the world usaa federal savings banks bank lobby located in san antonio is its only fullservice banking location other cities however hold financial centers often near military bases which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by usaa in addition to opening those accounts online banking services can be accessed in person by mail by phone or through the internet usaa federal savings bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the apple iphone and ipad mobile devices with googles android operating system and microsofts windows phone usaa was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the apple iphone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world major banking competitors include bank of americamilitary bank pentagon federal credit union and navy federal credit union investing and financial planningedit usaa provides brokerage services and noload mutual funds mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by usaa investment accounts or imco target marketedit usaas mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market which consists of members of the us military and their immediate families to that end the association has always marketed directly to members of the us military usaa membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel including those on active duty those in the national guard and reserve officer candidates in commissioning programs academy rotc ocsots and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably children of usaa members are also eligible to purchase usaas pc insurance products and former members of usaa are allowed to resume membership at any time without an age limit eligibility can be determined using its website however the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility usaa has in the past published a list of other eligible persons including special agents of the fbi and secret service agents of the various military investigative services ncis osi ci and cid us foreign service officers and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies recently usaa has been sharpening its focus on members of the military so people working for certain nonmilitary agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible historically only us military officers among certain other federally sworn officers were eligible to join usaa with descendants of usaa members able to purchase insurance from usaacic it did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer one could join at any time in  membership was opened to members of the national guard and reserves and in  eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services as the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the us armed forces is quite large usaa chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated the same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers as usaas capacity for taking on new members expanded eligibility criteria relaxed in  usaa expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees and all veterans who separated after  in november  usaa expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the us military auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria usaa investment products as well as depositonly banking services are available to nonmembers of the top ten automobile insurance competitors usaa is the only provider that restricts service to members of the united states military and their immediate families legal structureedit one of the characteristics that allows usaa to operate differently than most other fortune  companies is that it is not a corporation the united services automobile association is an interinsurance exchange the establishment of which is provided for under the texas insurance code this insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and ncos who have taken out pc policies with usaa thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and as a group own usaas assets normally in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members however the texas insurance code added a provision section  which stipulates that an interinsurance exchange can by agreement of the subscribers limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to usaa other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries adult children of usaa members and us military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at usaa as associate members insured through a subsidiary called usaacasualty insurance company usaacic usaacic is not an insurance exchange but rather a delaware insurance corporation this is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below nonstandardrisk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like usaas county mutual insurance company or usaageneral indemnity company usaa also insures members in europe through its subsidiary usaa limited it is uncommon for a us based insurance company to provide international pc coverage but usaa does so because so many military families are stationed outofcountry returning profits to the insurededit since there are no shareholders profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members returns are accomplished through a subscribers account commonly known as a distribution each year a portion of usaas profit is retained as unassigned the rest is allocated to each members subscribers account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the members subscribers account balance the allocation of capital to a members subscribers account occurs early in the calendar year late in the calendar year a portion of the members subscribers account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer members with more than  years of membership also receive a special yearly senior bonus distribution which amounts to  of the members subscribers account balance the entirety of the subscribers account belongs to the member but is not completely distributed until approximately  months after the member no longer has a usaa pc policy in  usaa returned  billion to its members those not eligible to join usaa but who are eligible to purchase insurance from usaas subsidiaries such as usaacic may receive dividends as declared by usaa miscellaneous informationedit usaas colorado

succeeded as ceo by retired air force general robert herres it was under herres that usaa expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed internet based financial services following general herres as ceo was robert g davis a former army officer who came to usaa with experience in a variety of financial services companies davis is said to have changed the culture at usaa during his time at usaa membership assets and net worth grew significantly his tenure however was not without controversy davis oversaw usaas first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership davis had indicated to usaa employees that he intended to continue to lead usaa until  however he retired in december  the nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous as usaa ceo josue robles has stated that upon assuming the role of ceo i thought i was just going to be a temporary ceo and the board said guess what the permanent ceo is you oversightedit usaa is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the us securities and exchange commissionclarification needed federal trade commission office of
