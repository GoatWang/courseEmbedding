in  at the time of the transaction avaya focused on providing telecommunications hardware since then many of the tasks handled through hardware have shifted to software a trend that has had a negative impact on networking hardware companies like avaya as a result avaya has had increasing difficulty in meeting its debt obligations the company arranged  million in financing underwritten by citibank to get it through the bankruptcy proceedings in april  avaya filed a restricting plan with the bankruptcy court the company would reduce its prefiling debt by  billion and secured creditors would own

the company revenue from software and services was about  of the total another record for avaya should the companys bankruptcy plan be approved and implemented it should give avaya room to maneuver by investing in research and development in software and services as well as sales and marketing efforts the sale of its networking business would provide an infusion of cash while divesting the unit

avaya oceana workspaces avaya helps rspca queensland talk to the animals jun   the queensland branch of the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals rspca queensland has further invested in the welfare of abandoned and injured animals with the widespread adoption of avaya video conferencing technology the solution enables rspcas diverse workforce to engage in better faster collection care treatment and placement of animals the animal welfare agency has seen a significant increase in the number of caredfor animals in the state in the last two years from about  in  to more than  domestic and native animals in  the work is conducted by a vast team of regional inspectors animal behaviorists veterinarians and other personnel who correspond with usbased professionals as required the introduction of advanced communications solutions like avaya video conferencing have played a key role in enabling the rspca queensland to grow its mission given its geographicallydispersed operations across queensland the agency required smarter ways of connecting more than  employees and its army of  volunteers previously workers spent hours traveling across the state to assess and rescue animals subsequently transporting the animals to facilities where they could administer full treatment if resources were not available in the field rspca queensland alleviated this issue using avaya video conferencing giving it a purposebuilt solution that ensures reliable communication the technology delivers highquality feeds on a lower bandwidth to keep the workforce connected and consequently reduces mounting operational costs all of which are supported by donations using the mobilefriendly avaya solution field workers and behaviorists can accurately assess abandoned animals in realtime by connecting to branch offices australian veterinarians or overseas specialists from any location this increases the number of healthy pets placed with new families for example dogs were previously taken to a main office to be filmed with the videos sent to specialists for evaluation using video conferencing helps rspca queensland continue saving more animals than any other organization in the southern hemisphere rspca queensland also uses avaya video conferencing for its education programs to further develop its staff volunteers and veterinary teams eliminating the need for them to travel to a central location to participate in training with highquality video that also includes file sharing and chat capabilities education can be delivered in realtime from operating theatres to all participants anytime and anywhere resources can therefore be invested in productivity rather than travel the animal welfare agency has identified other opportunities to leverage the avaya video solution this includes a training program through which experts help dog owners train their pets and a crisis notification system that relays crucial messages to workers rspca queenslands success using the avaya video conferencing solution has inspired other rspca branches to assess potential use cases for the technology within their own operations similar private companies by industry

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
