newsletters pooled funds share loading the player what are pooled funds pooled funds are funds from many individual investors that are aggregated for the purposes of investment as in the case of a mutual or pension fund investors in pooled fund investments benefit from economies of scale which allow for lower trading costs per dollar of investment diversification and professional money management along with the added costs involved in the form of management fees the main detractor of pooled fund investments is that capital gains are spread evenly among all investors — sometimes at the expense of new shareholders breaking down pooled funds groups such as investment clubs partnerships and trusts use pooled funds to invest in stocks bonds and mutual funds the pooled account lets the investors be treated as a single account holder allowing them to buy more sharespros and cons of pooled fundsgroups of investors can take advantage of opportunities typically available to only large investors in addition investors save on transaction costs and further diversify their portfolios however the individual investor has less control over the group’s investment decisions than he would making the decisions alone in addition each investor has different goals risk levels and exit strategies therefore not all group decisions are best for each individual in the group also the group must reach a consensus before deciding what to purchase when the market is volatile taking the time and effort to reach an agreement can take away opportunities for quick profits or reducing potential lossesadvantages of mutual fundsmutual funds spread their holdings across various investment vehicles reducing the effect any single security or class of securities has on the overall portfolio because mutual funds contain hundreds or thousands of securities investors are less affected if one security underperformsprofessionals manage nonindex mutual funds ensuring investors receive the best riskreturn tradeoff aligning with their objectives this helps investors who lack the time and knowledge for managing their own portfolios mutual funds allow reinvestment of dividends and interest for additional fund shares the investor saves money by not paying transaction fees while growing his portfolio mutual funds also offer a range of investment options for the highly aggressive mildly aggressive and riskadverse investor most investors can purchase mutual funds to help meet their objectivesdisadvantages of mutual fundswhen investing in a mutual fund an investor
