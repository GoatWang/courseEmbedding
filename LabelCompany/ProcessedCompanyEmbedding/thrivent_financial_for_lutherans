aid association for lutherans aal and lutheran brotherhood lb which had been established in  and  respectively the merger formed the largest fraternal benefit society in the united states aid association for lutheransedit head office of the aid association for lutherans circa  historyedit in the late th and early th century the lutheran church–missouri synod forbade its members to join fraternal societies because these required initiation rites and secret oaths life insurance was also frowned upon in some quarters because martin luther had written against similar enterprises in his day the practice could be considered a form of usury and it reflected a distrust in god in  albert voecks a member of st paul lutheran church in appleton wisconsin broached the idea of creating an insurance society for lutherans to fellow church members gottlieb ziegler and william zuehlke they each gave  to the fund and found several hundred others willing to contribute  each in  the founders of the society recruited the  applicants necessary to receive a charter from the state of wisconsin for their group it was chartered on november   as the aid association for lutherans in wisconsin and other states like most fraternal benefit societies of the time the aal operated on the actuarially unsound graded assessment system in  it began a move to the legal reserve system a transformation that was completed in   was also the year women were admitted as members most of the early business was conducted in german until this was discontinued in  membership was open only to members of the

health program and sponsored blood drives and family health workshops it also joined the national center for voluntary action lutheran brotherhoodedit historyedit the roots of lutheran brotherhood go back to the founding convention of the norwegian lutheran church of america when jacob preus the state insurance commissioner of minnesota proposed launching a notforprofit aid society as with other lutheran denominations this move proved controversial with some saying it indicated a lack of faith in god those who favored the society prevailed by arguing that the new aid society would prevent norwegian lutherans from joining unacceptable secret beneficial societies or lodges which was forbidden by conservative lutheran doctrine the organization authorized by the convention was called the luther union and was incorporated in the state of minnesota on september   that month the luther union entered into negotiations with lutheran brotherhood of america of des moines iowa these two organizations merged in the lutheran brotherhood in  the articles of incorporation of lutheran brotherhood stated its purpose “to aid the lutheran church in extending the lutheran faith to foster patriotism loyalty justice charity and benevolence to provide education instruction proper entertainment and amusements to encourage industry saving thrift and development on the part of its members

its business it was headquartered in minneapolis philanthropyedit the lb helped establish new lutheran congregations through the church extension fund sponsored scholarships for lutheran clergy and arranged seminars on christian topics mergersedit lutheran life insurance society of canadaedit in  the canadian branches of the lutheran brotherhood and the aid association for lutherans merged as a

written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a

with the merger of aid association for lutherans aal and lutheran brotherhood lb which had been established in  and  respectively the merger formed the largest fraternal benefit society in the united states aid association for lutheransedit head office of the aid association for lutherans circa  historyedit in the late th and early th century the lutheran church–missouri synod forbade its members to join fraternal societies because these required initiation rites and secret oaths life insurance was also frowned upon in some quarters because martin luther had written against similar enterprises in his day the practice could be considered a form of usury and it reflected a distrust in god in  albert voecks a member of st paul lutheran church in appleton wisconsin broached the idea of creating an insurance society for lutherans to fellow church members gottlieb ziegler and william zuehlke they each gave  to the fund and found several hundred others willing to contribute  each in  the founders of the society recruited the  applicants necessary to receive a charter from the state of wisconsin for their group it was chartered on november   as the aid association for lutherans in wisconsin and other states like most fraternal benefit societies of the time the aal operated on the actuarially unsound graded assessment system in  it began a move to the legal reserve system a transformation that was completed in   was also the year women were admitted as members most of the early business was conducted in german until this was discontinued in  membership was open only to members of the missouri synod and other lutherans who were in fellowship with it until the mids when it became open to lutherans of all denominations in the late s the association had  members this increased to about  members in  branches in  by  it was the largest member of the national fraternal congress of america and ranked th among the  insurance firms in the countryclarification needed ritualsedit the aal had no initiation rites oaths or other rituals nonprofit organizationedit the association was organized on two levels the local branches attached to lutheran congregations and the national level which consisted only of a board of directors that met four times a year the aal was particular about it locals not being called lodges because that was too similar to the nomenclature of oathbound ritualistic groups such as the freemasons or the oddfellows the aal was headquartered in appleton wisconsin philanthropyedit the aal was also involved philanthropically giving money to scholarships support for educational institutions and training for church workers grants were made to agencies boards and homes for the aged disabled and to minorities the association was also had its own family health program and sponsored blood drives and family health workshops it also joined the national center for voluntary action lutheran brotherhoodedit historyedit the roots of lutheran brotherhood go back to the founding convention of the norwegian lutheran church of america when jacob preus the state insurance commissioner of minnesota proposed launching a notforprofit aid society
