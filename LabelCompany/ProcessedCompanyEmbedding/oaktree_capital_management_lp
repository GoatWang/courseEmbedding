management lp excellence in investing our goal is excellence in investing to us this means achieving attractive returns without commensurate risk an imbalance which can only be achieved in markets that are not efficient although we strive for superior returns our first priority is that our actions produce consistency protection of capital and superior performance in bad times proprietary indepth research adding value in our markets requires a knowledge advantage that can come only from proprietary indepth research we have dedicated a staff of highly skilled specialists to each market and created a research methodology that is consistently applied our research revolves around enumerating the elements required for success and identifying investment candidates through which we seek to satisfy those requirements commonality of interests in order to achieve commonality of interests with our clients we pay strict attention to potential conflicts of interests avoiding them if possible and dealing fairly with them if not we put clients interests ahead of our own and treat all clients equally it is our fundamental operating principle that if all of our practices were to become known there must be no one with grounds for complaint communication with clients communication with clients must meet their needs and strengthen our relationships with them we want every client to thoroughly understand our philosophy approach actions and results if what we do ever comes as a surprise to a client then we have failed in this regard in reporting our performance we accurately state our achievements neither hiding behind excuses for losses nor taking credit for serendipitous gains management fee arrangements our management fee arrangements should compensate us fairly for the value we add and advance a constructive business relationship fee arrangements should motivate us to act solely in our clients best interests they should be fair competitive and explicit all accounts of comparable size must pay comparable fees for the same service new products when adding new products to oaktrees list of investment strategies we consider it far more important to avoid mistakes than to capture every opportunity in each case our decision to create a new product is based on      identification of an inefficient market with the potential for attractive returns      conviction that the market can be exploited in a limitedrisk fashion and      access to an investment team fully capable of producing the results we seek because of the high priority placed on assuring that these requirements are met we prefer that new oaktree products represent stepouts into highly related fields undertaken with people with whom we have had extensive firsthand experience profitability our firms profitability must stem from doing all of the above oaktree is run for the benefit of its clients and their constituencies as well as for its owners and employees profit
