to the public to provide full and adequate disclosure regarding the new business direction of the company and to provide such current adequate information as we believe the public would need in order to make an informed investment decision page  of  as used in this report and unless otherwise indicated the terms we us our the company and pspc refer to the protoscript pharmaceuticals corp form  disclosure item  business our corporate history and background yanex group inc was founded in the state of nevada on november   as an early stage company operating within the concept architectural interior design project and related areas in germany initially our plan was to operate in various architectural fields and to be responsible for the concept architectural vision of future private and public buildings as well as municipal organized public areas also we intended to work with interior design view visualization and renderings after attempting to implement our business plan we have determined that it would be in the best interest of the company and our shareholders to seek out and identify potential acquisition partners joint ventures or other strategic alliances accordingly on june   the company entered into a share exchange agreement the share exchange with protoscript pharmaceuticals corp a california corporation pspc whereby the company acquired  of the issued and outstanding common stock of pspc in exchange for thirty million  restricted shares of the companys common stock accordingly pspc became a whollyowned subsidiary of the company and the business direction of the company has shifted to the business of pspc the transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization transaction given the fact that the company held no net monetary assets at the date of the merger transaction as pspc is deemed to be the purchaser for accounting purposes under recapitalization accounting these pro forma financial statements are presented as a continuation of pspc  the equity of pspc is presented as the equity of the combined company and the capital stock account of pspc is adjusted to reflect the par value of the outstanding and issued common stock of the legal acquirer yanex after giving effect to the number of shares issued in the share exchange agreement who we are protoscript pharmaceuticals corp was incorporated under the laws of the state of california on june   pspcs primary source of revenue comes from the repair and rental of power wheelchairs and scooters pspc deals with federal state and private insurance providers such as medicare medical nevada care and blue cross among several others pspc has very limited dealings with noninsured cash patients we have tangible assets comprised of company delivery vehicles loaner wheelchairs office equipment and furniture inventory is purchased on an as needed basis typically when patientscustomers are approved for coverage by their insurance provider intangible assets comprise of its current patient list and working relationships with the various insurance providers who refer their clients to us for their repair and rental needs pspc was awarded a contract by the center for medicare  medicaid services that begins on july   and expires on december   the contract requires pspc to furnish certain items of durable medical equipment prosthetics orthotics and supplies dmepos under the medicare dmepos competitive bidding program competitive advantages we qualify as a small supplier as defined by the medicare competitive bidding program which we feel increases our changes of being awarded winning bids in the upcoming recompete rounds regulations stipulate that if  of winning companies do not fall under the small supplier category then more small suppliers must be added in essence making our changes one in three or better we are able to meet our service standards by buying product only on an as needed basis this prevents pspc from having to output cash before a purchase order is made all patients are prequalified before products are ordered and as such there is a low risk of nonpayment when the insurance provider refuses payment it is typically due to an error on the part of the staff in entering andor submitting the claim upon reentry the claim is typically successful although we do a majority of our purchases from three different suppliers due to betternegotiated prices we are able to buy the parts and products needed from various local and out of state suppliers page  of  repair sales cycle our typical repair cycle is as follows  patient lead i new patient referral is sent to pspc ii current patient is called iii current patient calls in iv new patient is obtained  patient information is gathered and insurance coverage eligibility is verified  upon verification a repair technician calls the patient for a preliminary telephone diagnosis  based on the repairs the technician believes is needed a second eligibility check is done to confirm the patient qualifies for those specific repairs  the office manager confirms a date and time range with the patient for the technician to pick up the equipment  routing information is passed on to the repair technician  repair technician sanitizes and loads a loaner wheelchair based on the patients specific needs and criteria  repair technician drops off the loaner chair picks up the patients equipment and fills out the necessary paperwork  the equipment is brought to the warehouse for a thorough diagnosis and forwarded to the office manager i if is typical upon full diagnostic testing the technician finds other parts in need of replacement or repair  eligibility is ran for a third and final time to confirm insurance coverage including any new parts that may be needed  the patient is contacted by the office manager to confirm the repairs that will be done and timeframe for expected delivery  upon complete repair of the equipment i head technician does a final inspection on the equipment ii the paperwork is forwarded to the office manager to setup a date and time frame for equipment drop off  paperwork is forwarded to the billing department for processing  the patients equipment is sanitized and prepared for delivery  the equipment is delivered to the patient the loaner is picked up and paperwork is filled by the patient  the loaner equipment is returned to the warehouse sanitized and stored operating systems and controls pspc currently uses a combination of software for the daily business operations the main billing and patient information software is being phased out and being be replaced by a more current software we expect the new software to help reduce paper redundancies manhours mistakes and the potential loss of data while increasing the security of patients information our billing process will also be more efficient as secondary payers will be processed automatically and triggered at the earliest possible moment growth strategy the dollar amount and frequency companies are allowed to bill patients and their insurance providers is set by medicare and therefore our competitors in the same product categories must charge the same price margins can be increased by processing more patients and decreasing costs pspc has the ability to process more patients without increase overhead and labor cost additionally pspc intends to advertise its billing services to other medical companies around the country companies in the durable medical equipment industry use standard healthcare common procedure coding system hcpcs in order to submit their invoices electronically to the insurance providers other companies can benefit from not needing inhouse billing by hiring pspc to process their payments for a rate of  of the revenue competitive bidding area cba since pspc does not currently hold a winning bid for one of the competitive bidding as further explained below areas cbas it has the potential to significantly increase revenues by doing so pspc will also benefit from lower cost of goods because of the expected increase in volume there are several criteria used to determine a companys qualification and more than one company can awarded an area and product we plan to aggressively target products such as catheters that dont fall under cba in the areas currently serviced of southern california and las vegas page  of  current working relationships we employ several strategies to increase its revenue one approach is to increase the referrals from the insurance providers by building relationships based on positive patient feedback insurance providers will refer a maximum of patients at any given time equivalent to the number of loaner equipment in stock for example by us having  loaner power wheelchairs in stock each provider will refer up to  patients at a given time current patient database a patient qualifies for repairs on their power wheelchair or scooter every six months to one year depending on the part that is in need of repair or replacing and a brand new power wheelchair every five years the patient database is constantly being contacted to arrange for repair upon a prior successful eligibility check intellectual property we have no patents or trademarks or applications pending government regulations numerous federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations including the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act collectively hipaa govern the collection dissemination security use and disclosure of patients individuallyidentifiable health information as part of our provision of and billing for health care equipment and services we are required to collect and maintain such protected patientidentifiable health information new health information standards whether implemented pursuant to hipaa congressional action state legislative actions or otherwise could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle health care related data and communicate with payers moreover the cost of complying with these standards could be significant while we believe we comply in all material respects with hipaa and comparable state privacy and security requirements we cannot provide any assurance that governmental authorities will find that our business practices comply with current or future administrative or judicial interpretations of these regulations sanctions for failure to comply with these federal and state laws include significant civil and criminal penalties a violation could subject us to penalties fines or possible exclusion from the medicare or medicaid programs such sanctions could adversely impact our financial condition revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations the federal government has made a policy decision to significantly increase the financial resources allocated to enforcing the health care fraud and abuse laws private insurers and various state enforcement agencies also have increased their level of scrutiny of health care claims in an effort to identify and prosecute fraudulent and abusive practices in the health care area medicare and medicaid as part of the social security amendments of  congress enacted the medicare program which provides for hospital physician and other statutorily defined health benefits for qualified individuals including persons  and older and the disabled the medicaid program also established by congress in  is a joint federal and state program that provides certain statutorilydefined health benefits to financially needy individuals who are blind disabled aged or members of families with dependent children under existing medicare laws and regulations the sale and rental of our products is generally reimbursed by the medicare program according to prescribed fee schedule amounts calculated using statutorilyprescribed formulas significant legislation affecting home medical equipment hme reimbursement has been signed into law including the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the ppaca the medicare improvement for patients and providers act of  mippa the medicare medicaid and childrens health insurance program chip and changes to these programs and acts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations page  of  competitive bidding area cba the durable medical equipment prosthetics orthotics and supplies dmepos competitive bidding program was mandated by congress through the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  mma the statute requires that medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for selected durable medical equipment prosthetics orthotics and supplies dmepos items with a competitive bid process the intent is to improve the effectiveness of the medicare methodology for setting dmepos payment amounts which will reduce beneficiary outofpocket expenses and save the medicare program money while ensuring beneficiary access to quality items and services under the program a competition among suppliers who operate in a particular competitive bidding area is conducted suppliers are required to submit a bid for selected products not all products or items are subject to competitive bidding bids are submitted electronically through a webbased application process and required documents are mailed bids are evaluated based on the suppliers eligibility its financial stability and the bid price contracts are awarded to the medicare suppliers who offer the best price and meet applicable quality and financial standards contract suppliers must agree to accept assignment on all claims for bid items and will be paid the bid price amount the amount is derived from the median of all winning bids for an item the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms is required by law to recompete contracts under the dmepos competitive bidding program at least once every three years the round  and national mailorder program contract periods expire on june   the federal government awards contracts to companies in the durable medical equipment dme industry upon a successful bid to service the specific areas and products winners of bid reserve the right service the competitive bidding areas cbas for a period of two years after the two year period the contract holders lose their rights and the cba all interested dme companies as requested to submit a bid pspc does not currently hold a winning bid and has submitted a bid for round  recompete the antikickback statute due to high fraud in the industry companies such as ours that operate within the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to strict fraud and abuse laws often referred to as the antikickback statute at the federal level the antikickback statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing any remuneration including a bribe kickback or rebate directly or indirectly in return for or to induce the referral of patients or the furnishing recommending or arranging for products or services covered by federal health care programs federal health care programs have been defined to include plans and programs that provide health benefits funded by the federal government including medicare and medicaid among others violations of the antikickback statute may result in civil and criminal penalties including fines of up to  per violation civil monetary penalties of up to  per violation assessments of up to three times the amount of the prohibited remuneration imprisonment and exclusion from participation in the federal health care programs chap accreditation we are voluntarily part of the community health accreditation program chap which is an industry recognized accreditation meeting high standards covering compliance requirements as prescribed by state and federal bodies payers and patients appreciated chap as a nonbiased thirdparty approval of the company in the industry chap also keeps pspc uptodate with regulatory changes and provides ongoing education to staff to familiarize themselves on how to stay in compliance page  of  competition we operated in a highly competitive industry with few national competitors and several local small and medium sized businesses our biggest competitor is apria healthcare group inc which has local national offices local competitors include lincoln medical and westview medical management believes that the number of competitors will decrease over the long run because of decreasing profit margins due to the competitive bidding programs implemented by the government the nature of the competitive bidding encourages lower prices therefore forcing some companies out of businesses employees as of january   we have  full time employees our employees are not currently represented by a labor union of labor organization these employees are spread out into various departments including management billing sales and repair the billing sales and management are headquartered out of rancho cucamonga ca while anaheim ca serves as repair facilities with limited staff the las vegas office is the headquarters for nevada as well as it serves as a repair facility anaheim and las vegas each have outside sales staff all locations are required to be staffed for a minimum number of hours a week as required by state laws the sales department includes outside and inside sales people outside sales people host fall prevention seminars in order to generate leads the seminars are held at care facilities and during the presentation the repair technician provides equipment cleaning and onsite repair at no cost item a risk factors you should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this current report on form k as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings with the sec we believe these risks and uncertainties individually or in the aggregate could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity further additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our results and business operations risks associated with our business   we rely on contract manufacturing of our products our inability to secure production sources meeting our quality cost working conditions and other requirements or failures by our contractors to perform could harm our sales and reputation   we source our products from thirdparty manufacturers as a result we must locate and secure products that meet our demands we depend on our manufacturers to maintain adequate financial resources and maintain sufficient development and manufacturing capacity we do not have material longterm contracts with any of our manufacturers and these manufacturers generally may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time our dependence on contract manufacturers could subject us to a number of risks if these manufacturers do not meet our quality cost working conditions and other requirements or if they fail to materially perform any of which could seriously harm our sales and reputation further if we need to place greater demands on our current manufacturers due to increased customer demands or seek additional or replacement manufacturers we may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us if at all   violation of labor laws and practices by our manufacturers and suppliers could harm our business   we require our manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations while the company promotes ethical business practices we do not control our manufacturers or suppliers or their labor practices the violation of labor or other laws by any of our manufacturers or suppliers or divergence of their labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the local markets could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products damage our reputation or expose us to potential liability for their wrongdoings page  of    a privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationship with our customers expose the company to litigation risk and adversely affect our business   as part of our normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential patientscustomer information despite security measures we have in place our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers expose the company to risks of litigation and liability and adversely affect our business information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm the company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure any significant breakdown intrusion interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business we use electronic information technology it in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business despite our implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyber attack and other similar disruptions a material breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property andor confidential business information harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business we have from time to time experienced incidents related to our it systems and expect that such incidents will continue including malware and computer virus attacks unauthorized access systems failures and disruptions we have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access but we may not be able to prevent immediately detect or remediate such events medicare regulations medicare regulations and bylaws have a pattern of changing every two to four years changes typically include what equipment is covered by insurance what percentage of the equipment is covered and what dollar amount medicare will cover on behalf of the patient changes in federal government also have an impact on the industry because different governments have shown to allot different budgets for the industry any unforeseen change in these regulation could have a negative impact on our business the medicare industry is heavily regulated by state and federal rules and law and as such the company is subject to regular inspections and audits and needs to maintain compliance employees are subject to laws and regulations as well being governed by ethics and standards of conduct and violations can result in severe penalties we may be subject to sanction under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act of  hipaa governs the collection dissemination security use and disclosure of patients individuallyidentifiable health information as part of our regular business activity we are required to collect and store such information sanctions for failure to comply with these federal and state laws include significant civil and criminal penalties and could result in fines or possible exclusion from the medicare or medicaid programs such sanctions could adversely impact our financial condition revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations we transitioned to new web based software in march  the new software is hipaa compliant and will be used for recording transmitting and storing billing as well as patient information using the new software will relieve the company of some of the compliance responsibilities specifically the storage and transmission of sensitive information page  of  reliance on the internet our operations depend heavily on our access to our billing software which is completely internet based failure to be able to connect to the internet would cause disruptions in our business including the inability to obtain new patients loss of existing patients and delay in revenue collection potential decreasing profit margins the reimbursement amounts offered by state and federal governments may decrease in the upcoming years due to tightening federal and state budgets this could lead to decreases in price due to the competitive bidding program set forth by the federal government write off of intangible assets our intangible assets are evaluated every quarter for impairment of value if management determines that a significant impairment has occurred we would be required to writeoff the impaired portion of the unamortized intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the writeoff occurs our success relies on our continued relationships with physicians our success in part is dependent upon referrals and our ability to maintain good relations with physicians and other referral sources physicians and other medical personnel that refer patients to us are not our employees and are free to refer their patients to our competitors if we are unable to successfully cultivate new referral sources and maintain strong relationships with our current referral sources then our revenues may decline inadequate insurance coverage participants in the health care industry including us are subject to substantial claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business often involving large claims and significant defense costs as a result of the liability risks inherent in our lines of business we maintain liability insurance intended to cover such claims our insurance policies are subject to annual renewal the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate and we may not be able to obtain liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or at all in addition we have been advised by our insurance broker that our insurance premiums will be subject to increases in the future which increases may be material furthermore the losses that are insured through commercial insurance are subject to the credit risk of those insurance companies while we believe our commercial insurance providers are currently credit worthy there can be no assurance that such insurance companies will remain so in the future inadequate insurance coverage limits increases in our insurance costs or losses suffered due to one or more of our insurance carriers defaulting on their obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations potential litigation the nature of our business subjects us to investigations and litigation in the ordinary course of our business in addition we are from time to time involved in other legal proceedings while management does not believe that any lawsuit we are a party to if resolved adversely would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations investigations and litigation could arise in the future which could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and profitability lack of diversification pspc has diversification with patients but not products since the company is focused on a specific part of the medicare industry a hard change by the government would result in a large decrease in revenue for example if medicare were to stop allowing repairs of power wheelchairs proposed changes by the government we are aware that the federal government is considering changing the procedure to require companies in the industry to get authorization before starting the repair currently the industry standard to confirm coverage proceed with the repair and it is expected that payment will follow the governments purpose is to cut down on fraudulent billing any change in the current procedures could have a negative impact on our business page  of  barriers to expansion being in a heavily regulated industry there is a complicated process to setup new facilities and different states have different requirements some states such as nevada required pspc to have a full functioning and staffed facility before starting the licensing process the permits and licenses took  months which cost the company  months of overhead without the ability generate income business disruptions could affect our operating results a significant portion of our development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas a major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected risks relating to ownership of our securities   we do not currently have a class of securities registered under section  of the exchange act we do not currently have a class of securities registered under section  of the exchange act we are not currently required to file reports under section a or under section d of the exchange act and are a considered a voluntary filer with respect to the reports we do file under those sections we will not be required to file reports under section a or d of the exchange act until the earlier to occur of i our registration of a class of securities under section  of the exchange act which would be required if we list a class of securities on a national securities exchange or if we meet the size requirements set forth in section g of the exchange act or which we may voluntarily elect to undertake at an earlier date or ii the effectiveness of a registration statement under the securities act relating to our common stock however until we become subject to the reporting requirements under either section a or d of the exchange act we expect that we will voluntarily file the reports that we would be required to file if we were subject to those sections our stock price may be volatile which may result in losses to our shareholders   the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations and the market prices of companies listed on the otc quotation system in which shares of our common stock are listed have been volatile in the past and have experienced sharp share price and trading volume changes the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to many factors including the following some of which are beyond our control · variations in our operating results · changes in expectations of our future financial performance including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors · changes in operating and stock price performance of other companies in our industry · additions or departures of key personnel and · future sales of our common stock   domestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations as well as general economic and political conditions unrelated to our performance may adversely affect the price of our common stock our common shares may become thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all we cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for trading our common stock will be sustained although the trading volume of our common shares increased significantly recently it has historically been sporadically or thinlytraded meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at certain given time may be relatively small or nonexistent page  of  this situation is attributable to a number of factors including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts stockbrokers institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume even if we came to the attention of such persons those persons tend to be riskaverse and may be reluctant to follow purchase or recommend the purchase of shares of an unproven company such as ours until such time as we become more seasoned and viable as a consequence there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or nonexistent as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price we cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained or that current trading levels will be sustained the market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small company which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price you may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price if at all which may result in substantial losses to you shareholders should be aware that according to sec release no  the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse such patterns include  control of the market for the security by one or a few brokerdealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer  manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases  boiler room practices involving highpressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons  excessive and undisclosed bidask differential and markups by selling brokerdealers and  the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and brokerdealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of brokerdealers who participate in the market management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities the occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to our common shareholders we presently do not anticipate that we will pay dividends on any of our common stock in the foreseeable future if payment of dividends does occur at some point in the future it would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings if any capital requirements and general financial condition the payment of any common stock dividends will be within the discretion of our board of directors we presently intend to retain all earnings after paying the interest for the preferred stock if any to implement our business plan accordingly we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends for common stock in the foreseeable future   volatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation the market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility as compared to seasoned issuers and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future in the past plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities we may in the future be the target of similar litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert managements attention and resources the elimination of monetary liability against our directors officers and employees under nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights of our directors officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors officers and employees our articles of incorporation contains a specific provision that eliminates the liability of our directors and officers for monetary damages to our company and shareholders further we are prepared to give such indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided for by nevada law we may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers the foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers which we may be unable to recoup these provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions if successful might otherwise benefit our company and shareholders   page  of  our sole officer and director owns approximately  of our shares after the offering that permits her to exert influence over us or to prevent a change of control our sole director and officer ms michelle rico will beneficially own approximately  of our outstanding shares of common stock as a result of this stock ownership ms michelle rico will continue to influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders including the election of directors amendments to the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws and the approval of significant corporate transactions this consolidation of voting power could also delay deter or prevent a change of our control that might be otherwise beneficial to shareholders our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance   because our common stock is publicly traded we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded these entities including the public company accounting oversight board the sec and finra have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress most notably the sarbanesoxley act of  our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue resulting in increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities because new and modified laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices item  financial information managements discussion and analysis the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report the discussions of results causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that these results or trends will necessarily

this item page  of  critical accounting policies our financial statements are presented in united states dollars and are prepared using the accrual method of accounting and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  the accounting policies of an entity are the specific accounting principles and the methods of applying those principles are judged by the management of the entity to be the most appropriate in the circumstances to present fairly financial position cash flows and results of operations in accordance with us gaap and that accordingly have been adopted for preparing our consolidated financial statements   going concern our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which implies that we will continue to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business   during the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of  and had a working capital deficit of   the continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders the ability to raise capital through debt or equity financing and the attainment of profitable operations from our business  these factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern  our financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern   use of estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented we are required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate actual future results may be different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail the results could be materially different from our reported results revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies comply with fasb asc topic  revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the service has been provided the products have been shipped and billed to our customers insurance companies and government agencies and no other significant obligations exist and collectability is reasonably assured  our billings are subject to insurance company and government regulatory agency adjustments we revise the amount of revenue recognized when the insurance company and government regulatory adjustments are known to us  the adjustments to the amounts we can bill are changed approximately every five years when the government asks companies to submit a new bid there is approximately a one year delay between when we are notified of any price changes until the time the new amounts come into effect accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount that we expect to collect we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments past due balances over  days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate adversely affecting their ability to make payments additional allowances would be required based on managements assessment we provide for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance balances that remain outstanding after we have used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable we report patient accounts receivable net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts and adjustments patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and primarily consist of amounts due from medicare other thirdparty payers and patients our process for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections and trends in reimbursement  page  of  inventory we purchase inventory from third party vendors which consists of wheelchairs and scooters inventory when carried if at all represents finished goods which is stated at lower of cost or market we periodically review the value of items held in inventory and provides for writedowns or writeoffs based on its assessment of market conditions writedowns and writeoffs are charged to cost of goods sold  we generally purchases product when it has a firm sales or service order earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing our net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares during the period diluted earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing our net income loss by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during such period diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or common stock equivalent diluted earnings loss per share are the same as basic income loss per share due to no dilutive items having been issued by us recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  revenue from contracts with customers asu   which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the core principle of asu  is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services asu  defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and in doing so more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing us gaap the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein using either of the following transition methods i a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or ii a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting asu  recognized at the date of adoption which includes additional footnote disclosures early adoption is not permitted the

that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships limited liability corporations and securitization structures collateralized debt obligations collateralized loan obligations and mortgagebacked security transactions asu  is effective for periods beginning december   the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements early adoption is permitted   in september  the fasb issued asu no  business combinations topic    topic  requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination during the measurement period to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts the amendments in the update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined the acquirer is required to also record in the same periods financial statements the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects if any as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date  in addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in currentperiod earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date asu  is effective for fiscal years beginning december   the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements page  of  in november  the fasb issued asu no  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  the new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities along with any related valuation allowance be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet this update is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods the company does not anticipate the adoption of this asu will have a significant impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows   in february

make payments additional allowances would be required based on managements assessment the company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation

its assets then assets are written down first followed by other longlived assets of the operation to fair value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values depending on

to actual results   as used in this annual report the terms we us our the company and yanex mean yanex group inc unless otherwise indicated   all dollar amounts refer to us dollars unless otherwise indicated   overview we were founded in the state of nevada on november   as an early stage company operating within the concept architectural interior design project and related areas in germany initially our plan was to operate in various architectural fields and to be responsible for the concept architectural vision of future private and public buildings as well as municipal organized public areas also we intended to work with interior design view visualization and renderings after attempting to implement our business plan we have determined that it would be in the best interest of the company and our shareholders to seek out and identify potential acquisition partners joint ventures or other strategic alliances accordingly on june   the company entered into a share exchange agreement the share exchange with protoscript pharmaceuticals corp a california corporation pspc whereby the company acquired  of the issued and outstanding common stock of pspc in exchange for thirty million  restricted shares of the companys common stock accordingly pspc became a whollyowned subsidiary of the company and the business direction of the company has shifted to the business of pspc we are a development stage company our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern our common stock trades on the otc pink sheets under the symbol ynxg   we do not have any subsidiaries our principal office is located at  th street suite  rancho cucamonga california  our telephone number is   our fiscal year end is may    we have incurred losses since our inception we rely upon the sale of our securities to fund our operations we have not generated any revenues from november   date of inception to may   we are not involved in any bankruptcy receivership or similar proceedings who we are the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of california on june   under the name of protoscript pharmaceuticals corp the companys primary source of revenue comes from the repair and rental of power wheelchairs and scooters the company deals with federal state and private insurance providers such as medicare medical nevada care and blue cross among several others pspc has very limited dealings with noninsured cash patients we have tangible assets comprised of company delivery vehicles loaner wheelchairs office equipment and furniture inventory is purchased on an as needed basis typically when patientscustomers are approved for coverage by their insurance provider intangible assets comprise of its current patient list and working relationships with the various insurance providers who refer their clients to us for their repair and rental needs  competitive advantages we qualify as a small supplier as defined by the medicare competitive bidding program which we feel increases our changes of being awarded winning bids in the upcoming recompete rounds regulations stipulate that if  of winning companies do not fall under the small supplier category then more small suppliers must be added in essence making our changes one in three or better we are able to meet our service standards by buying product only on an as needed basis this prevents the company from having to output cash before a purchase order is made all patients are prequalified before products are ordered and as such there is a low risk of nonpayment when the insurance provider refuses payment it is typically due to an error on the part of the staff in entering andor submitting the claim upon reentry the claim is typically successful although we do a majority of our purchases from three different suppliers due to betternegotiated prices we are able to buy the parts and products needed from various local and out of state suppliers repair sales cycle our typical repair cycle is as follows  patient lead a new patient referral is sent to pspc b current patient is called c current patient calls in d new patient is obtained  patient information is gathered and insurance coverage eligibility is verified  upon verification a repair technician calls the patient for a preliminary telephone diagnosis  based on the repairs the technician believes is needed a second eligibility check is done to confirm the patient qualifies for those specific repairs  the office manager confirms a date and time range with the patient for the technician to pick up the equipment  routing information is passed on to the repair technician  repair technician sanitizes and loads a loaner wheelchair based on the patients specific needs and criteria  repair technician drops off the loaner chair picks up the patients equipment and fills out the necessary paperwork  the equipment is brought to the warehouse for a thorough diagnosis and forwarded to the office manager a if is typical upon full diagnostic testing the technician finds other parts in need of replacement or repair  eligibility is ran for a third and final time to confirm insurance coverage including any new parts that may be needed  the patient is contacted by the office manager to confirm the repairs that will be done and timeframe for expected delivery  upon complete repair of the equipment a head technician does a final inspection on the equipment b the paperwork is forwarded to the office manager to setup a date and time frame for equipment drop off  paperwork is forwarded to the billing department for processing  the patients equipment is sanitized and prepared for delivery  the equipment is delivered to the patient the loaner is picked up and paperwork is filled by the patient   the loaner equipment is returned to the warehouse sanitized and stored operating systems and controls the company currently uses a combination of software for the daily business operations the main billing and patient information software is being phased out and being be replaced by a more current software we expect the new software to help reduce paper redundancies manhours mistakes and the potential loss of data while increasing the security of patients information our billing process will also be more efficient as secondary payers will be processed automatically and triggered at the earliest possible moment growth strategy the dollar amount and frequency companies are allowed to bill patients and their insurance providers is set by medicare and therefore our competitors in the same product categories must charge the same price margins can be increased by processing more patients and decreasing costs pspc has the ability to process more patients without increase overhead and labor cost additionally the company intends to advertise its billing services to other medical companies around the country companies in the durable medical equipment industry use standard healthcare common procedure coding system hcpcs in order to submit their invoices electronically to the insurance providers other companies can benefit from not needing inhouse billing by hiring pspc to process their payments for a rate of  of the revenue competitive bidding area cba since the company does not currently hold a winning bid for one of the competitive bidding as further explained below areas cbas it has the potential to significantly increase revenues by doing so pspc will also benefit from lower cost of goods because of the expected increase in volume there are several criteria used to determine a companys qualification and more than one company can awarded an area and product we plan to aggressively target products such as catheters that dont fall under cba in the areas currently serviced of southern california and las vegas current working relationships we employ several strategies to increase its revenue one approach is to increase the referrals from the insurance providers by building relationships based on positive patient feedback insurance providers will refer a maximum of patients at any given time equivalent to the number of loaner equipment in stock for example by us having  loaner power wheelchairs in stock each provider will refer up to  patients at a given time current patient database a patient qualifies for repairs on their power wheelchair or scooter every six months to one year depending on the part that is in need of repair or replacing and a brand new power wheelchair every five years the patient database is constantly being contacted to arrange for repair upon a prior successful eligibility check intellectual property we have no patents or trademarks or applications pending government regulations numerous federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations including the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act collectively hipaa govern the collection dissemination security use and disclosure of patients individuallyidentifiable health information as part of our provision of and billing for health care equipment and services we are required to collect and maintain such protected patientidentifiable health information new health information standards whether implemented pursuant to hipaa congressional action state legislative actions or otherwise could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle health care related data and communicate with payers moreover the cost of complying with these standards could be significant while we believe we comply in all material respects with hipaa and comparable state privacy and security requirements we cannot provide any assurance that governmental authorities will find that our business practices comply with current or future administrative or judicial interpretations of these regulations sanctions for failure to comply with these federal and state laws include significant civil and criminal penalties a violation could subject us to penalties fines or possible exclusion from the medicare or medicaid programs such sanctions could adversely impact our financial condition revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations  the federal government has made a policy decision to significantly increase the financial resources allocated to enforcing the health care fraud and abuse laws private insurers and various state enforcement agencies also have increased their level of scrutiny of health care claims in an effort to identify and prosecute fraudulent and abusive practices in the health care area medicare and medicaid as part of the social security amendments of  congress enacted the medicare program which provides for hospital physician and other statutorily defined health benefits for qualified individuals including persons  and older and the disabled the medicaid program also established by congress in  is a joint federal and state program that provides certain statutorilydefined health benefits to financially needy individuals who are blind disabled aged or members of families with dependent children under existing medicare laws and regulations the sale and rental of our products is generally reimbursed by the medicare program according to prescribed fee schedule amounts calculated using statutorilyprescribed formulas significant legislation affecting home medical equipment hme reimbursement has been signed into law including the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the ppaca the medicare improvement for patients and providers act of  mippa the medicare medicaid and childrens health insurance program chip and changes to these programs and acts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations competitive bidding area cba the durable medical equipment prosthetics orthotics and supplies dmepos competitive bidding program was mandated by congress through the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  mma the statute requires that medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for selected durable medical equipment prosthetics orthotics and supplies dmepos items with a competitive bid process the intent is to improve the effectiveness of the medicare methodology for setting dmepos payment amounts which will reduce beneficiary outofpocket expenses and save the medicare program money while ensuring beneficiary access to quality items and services under the program a competition among suppliers who operate in a particular competitive bidding area is conducted suppliers are required to submit a bid for selected products not all products or items are subject to competitive bidding bids are submitted electronically through a webbased application process and required documents are mailed bids are evaluated based on the suppliers eligibility its financial stability and the bid price contracts are awarded to the medicare suppliers who offer the best price and meet applicable quality and financial standards contract suppliers must agree to accept assignment on all claims for bid items and will be paid the bid price amount the amount is derived from the median of all winning bids for an item the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms is required by law to recompete contracts under the dmepos competitive bidding program at least once every three years the round  and national mailorder program contract periods expire on june   the federal government awards contracts to companies in the durable medical equipment dme industry upon a successful bid to service the specific areas and products winners of bid reserve the right service the competitive bidding areas cbas for a period of two years after the two year period the contract holders lose their rights and the cba all interested dme companies as requested to submit a bid pspc does not currently hold a winning bid and has submitted a bid for round  recompete the antikickback statute due to high fraud in the industry companies such as ours that operate within the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to strict fraud and abuse laws often referred to as the antikickback statute at the federal level the antikickback statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing any remuneration including a bribe kickback or rebate directly or indirectly in return for or to induce the referral of patients or the furnishing recommending or arranging for products or services covered by federal health care programs federal health care programs have been defined to include plans and programs that provide health benefits funded by the federal government including medicare and medicaid among others violations of the antikickback statute may result in civil and criminal penalties including fines of up to  per violation civil monetary penalties of up to  per violation assessments of up to three times the amount of the prohibited remuneration imprisonment and exclusion from participation in the federal health care programs  chap accreditation we are voluntarily part of the community health accreditation program chap which is an industry recognized accreditation meeting high standards covering compliance requirements as prescribed by state and federal bodies payers and patients appreciated chap as a nonbiased thirdparty approval of the company in the industry chap also keeps the company uptodate with regulatory changes and provides ongoing education to staff to familiarize themselves on how to stay in compliance competition we operated in a highly competitive industry with few national competitors and several local small and medium sized businesses our biggest competitor is apria healthcare group inc which has local national offices local competitors include lincoln medical and westview medical management believes that the number of competitors will decrease over the long run because of decreasing profit margins due to the competitive bidding programs implemented by the government the nature of the competitive bidding encourages lower prices therefore forcing some companies out of

company these financial statements are presented in united states dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states b use of estimates the

amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported accounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowances the company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual results experienced by the company may differ materially and adversely from the companys estimates to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results future results of operations will be affected c cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents d financial instruments pursuant to asc  fair value measurements and disclosures an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value a financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement asc  prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value f  significant accounting policies continued d financial instruments continued level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets or modelderived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities the companys financial instruments consist principally of cash amounts due from related parties accounts payable and accrued liabilities pursuant to asc  and  the fair value of our cash is determined based on level  inputs which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets we believe that the recorded values of all of our other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations e income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with asc  income taxes the asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized f comprehensive loss asc  comprehensive income establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements as of may   and may   the company has no items that represent comprehensive income or loss and therefore has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements g loss per share the company computes net loss per share in accordance with asc  earnings per share asc  requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share eps on the face of the income statement basic eps is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders numerator by the weighted average number of shares outstanding denominator during the period diluted eps gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the ifconverted method in computing diluted eps the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time period specified in the secs rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer covered by this report we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of may   the evaluation date based upon the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the evaluation date the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is identified below which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures managements report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange rule af our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and our receipts and expenditures of are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of may   in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework based on its evaluation our management concluded that there is a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and management has concluded that the companys internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective as of may   a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the material weakness relates to the lack of segregation of duties in our financial reporting process and we utilize outside third party consultants we do not have a separately designated audit committee this weakness is due to our lack of excess working capital to hire additional staff to remedy this material weakness we intend to engage an internal accountant to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow klj  associates llp our registered independent public accounting firm was not required to and has not issued a report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of may   changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended may   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting  limitations on the effectiveness of controls our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management or board override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected   changes in internal control and financial reporting during the quarter ended may   there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
