eat peanuts and throw the shells on the floor everywhere you step there is peanut shellsthis is goodthey give y worst worst service  place is run by unethical rude manager i gave into all the hype and finally tonight with three friends went to the texas roadhouse all four of us are highly qualified professionals but we had a horrible experience fi judys book  other sources  write review steakhouse you dont have to worry about being messy at   dora w i love going to texas roadhousethis place is what a steakhouse should be like if youre going in for dinner prepare to wait a bit but while youre waiting endulge in the free peanuts you can just drop the shells on the ground cool huh the food is also great i personally like the ribs a lot more than the steak but the steak is great too they serve these delicious rolls before your meal i usually eat so many of them that i cant finish my actual meal be prepared to spend about  a person its worth it though more reply  report abuse  a mans meal   hoyi y texas roadhouse is the best place a man can go with free peanuts and free bread who can ask for more but wait it does get better with hearty meals like steak and chicken its not for people with a small stomach it will fulfill your needs if you are hungry the price is great too not that expensive only downfall is the line because its so good many people go there more reply  report abuse  lovely dining   rowena t texas roadhouse provides you a waiting area with peanuts so you dont need to wait outside like other restuarantsand if youre waiting long at least you wont starve i absolutely love the bread it is awesome a must try the workers are very kind and very amazing the waiter i had memorized everyones orders and made no mistakes we were a party of  and each person had a meal where it comes with  things like baked potatoes soup etc so it was very amazing how he didnt have to write anything down more reply  report abuse  good food at good prices   anson t they really have great bread i think the bread is so good that i will go there just for the bread they also have this cinnamon butter that is irresistable which even enhances the bread even more the steaks are awesome because when you ask for medium rare they really do give you a slab of juicy medium rare steak the service there is amazing and my food came almost instantly after i ordered more reply  report abuse  texas road house   alvin n texas road house is one of the worst place i have ever eaten at before the service is horriable i do not recommend anyone to come to this place because oh the poor service their ok food sure they may seem nice but if it takes  minutes to make a salads then theres a problem at the place now but if you want to try their food then go to another one maybe a one that you can find that is actually good and has some service more reply  report abuse   previous  next  menu for texas roadhouse please enable javascript to view this business menus summer discount   off
