january  ernesto zedillo a professor in the field of international economics and politics at yale university was president of mexico from  to  the mexican government has been courteous toward donald trump as both a candidate and now us president indeed mexican president enrique peña nieto has paid a high political cost at home for his being open to working constructively with president trump but peña nieto has done the right thing by putting the interests of mexico and the preservation of mutually beneficial relations with our neighbor above his personal popularity nevertheless the time has come to admit that the actions of the new administration have closed off at least for the foreseeable future the possibility of any agreement being achieved through dialogue and negotiation that could satisfy the interests of both parties this is an unfortunate and sad situation but the effort to accommodate president trump’s capricious wishes has proven worthless and should not be continued it is not useful for mexico or the united states zoeann murphythe washington post in retrospect the probability of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement on the topics on president trump’s mexico agenda was always small considering that his demands have defied legal and economic rationality all along for example president trump’s aspiration to renegotiate nafta stems from the incorrect idea that the trade balance between the two countries originates in mexican advantages built into nafta and that a trade balance if positive for mexico means the automatic transfer of jobs from the united states to its southern partner both concepts are mistaken equally erroneous is president trump’s failure to account for how modern transportation systems and information technology have changed international trade this progress has created sophisticated supply chains that deliver products and services including new ones at low prices given its amazing technological and entrepreneurial capacity the united states has been the main beneficiary of this new way of organizing international production and trade many american firms are able to compete successfully around the world with those from europe and asia and therefore can provide highquality goodpaying us jobs precisely because they are free to develop links along their supply chains in places such as mexico — in this case thanks to nafta that’s why it should have been evident from the start that it would be impossible to accommodate president trump’s objective of balancing the trade account with mexico by tweaking nafta alone if president trump remains obsessed with that wrongheaded objective mexico should take that as a wish to kill nafta which of course is something that he has the legal ability to do it would be a waste of time for the mexican government to play a naftatweaking game with the trump administration only if the us government submits a serious and clear agenda of naftarelated points consistent with the interests of the two countries should mexican authorities move to restart the dialogue at this point however such a scenario is most unlikely and the prudent thing would be to assume that president trump will kill nafta of course this would be costly for the two economies — and at least initially disproportionately so for mexico but such an outcome should not be cause for despair in my country nafta has been an excellent instrument but it is only one among many tools available to pursue the goals of economic growth and development unlike its northern neighbor mexico should reinforce its commitment to openness and sound economic policies we cannot afford to do otherwise mexico can create new conditions that will keep and even enhance our standing as a good place for global companies to produce for our own and other important markets not least the united states we should reassure global companies with concrete actions that mexico will remain open for business and that our government will not try to intimidate them or tell them what where and how to produce the current mexican administration which successfully launched incredibly ambitious economic reforms in its early years should return to this reformist impulse the end of nafta as disruptive and costly as it would be in the short term could be compensated for with the right set of policies of course as he has threatened president trump may wish to go beyond the cancellation of nafta and try to impose additional barriers on trade with mexico my country must be ready to use all legal instruments possible particularly those provided by the world trade organization to contest any arbitrary and illegal action president trump could even entertain the withdrawal of the united states from that central arbiter of international trade disputes at which point the mexican issue would become a global problem that would have to be confronted by the full international community as for president trump’s border wall obviously there is little the mexican government can do to encourage more enlightened us immigration policies these are strictly a domestic matter despite the consequences for other countries including mexico but it’s clear that if economics counts it is far better to make good laws than pernicious walls those laws must support a wellfunctioning us labor market without providing incentives for a black market of undocumented lowskilled workers of course repeating this to president trump would be beside the point the wall seems to be another of his obsessions visavis mexico and it’s none of mexico’s business if the us government wants to add to its national debt by building a white elephant on its own territory what we reject under any circumstances is any attempt to use a single inch of our territory to build such an abominable structure all mexicans are behind president peña nieto when he tells president trump that we will not pay for his extravagant offensive and useless project read more on this

american court is preparing to judge the man who brought democracy to mexico for war crimes the case looks like a settling of political scores sep st   mexico city add this article to your reading list by clicking this button tweet by the time the shooting had finished  men women and children lay dead or dying deep in the jungle the massacre at acteal a hamlet in chiapas was the worst single act of violence during the unrest that shook mexico’s far south in the s zapatista guerrillas had declared war on the federal government on new year’s day  the fighting was brief but sympathisers on each side then used the conflict to settle differences over land religion and much else the government’s supposed ties to the killers who on december nd  opened fire on acteal a place mainly sympathetic to the zapatistas have never been fully established nearly  years later the acteal murders could be tried in a court  miles away in connecticut ernesto zedillo who was mexico’s president from  to  is now a professor at yale university his residence in the state has given ten tzotzilspeaking indians who claim to be survivors of the  massacre an opportunity to sue him in a civil court in the united states they are seeking about m and a declaration of guilt against mr zedillo in this sectionthe trials of ernesto zedillo talking about talks a tragedy foretold reprints many people in mexico contend that rather than a search for justice the case looks like a settling of political scores by presiding over the full democratisation of his country mr zedillo angered sections of his institutional revolutionary party pri which for decades had a monopoly of power he broke two of the unwritten rules of the pri’s authoritarian regime he drove through reforms that allowed free and fair elections and quickly acknowledged the party’s defeat in  and he struck against his predecessor carlos salinas mr zedillo’s administration ordered the arrest of raúl salinas the previous president’s brother on charges of illicit enrichment and complicity in the murder of his exbrotherinlaw a pri official after he had spent ten years in jail he was absolved of all the charges although swiss authorities confiscated m they said had been obtained illicitly the plaintiffs in the acteal case allege that mr zedillo assisted or turned a blind eye to paramilitary groups of villagers organised by the army to suppress the zapatistas they say that during several mexican investigations into the massacre none of which has ever fingered mr zedillo he conspired to cover up the crimes mr zedillo’s lawyers say that the president had nothing to do with the atrocity for which scores of people including some lowlevel officials were convicted though mexico’s supreme court later quashed  of the convictions they also assert mr zedillo’s right to legal immunity for acts committed while carrying out his duties as head of state america’s state department must decide before september th whether to recommend immunity it is not clear which side it will come down on the obama administration has no particular desire to try a highly respected former president of a neighbouring country that is sensitive about its sovereignty mexico’s government has said that the united states has no business judging matters that took place outside its territory and do not involve americans the administration appears hesitant about the idea of universal jurisdiction in civil suits it said that a group of nigerians could sue shell an anglodutch oil group in an american court but later added that this did not apply to acts committed abroad after zedillo calderón the decision will doubtless be closely watched by felipe calderón mexico’s current president whose term ends on december st his sixyear war against mexico’s drug mobs has made him many dangerous enemies he is rumoured to be seeking a niche at an american university if the action against mr zedillo goes ahead somebody might try to sue mr calderón over the  or so deaths—some at the hands of federal forces—that have taken place during his crackdown on organised crime but if mr zedillo is granted immunity so might mr calderón be the case against mr zedillo has several odd features for a start the tzotzil indians have chosen to remain anonymous that is unusual and in mexico would not be allowed “i cannot remember an important humanrights case in which the plaintiffs are anonymous” says sergio aguayo an activist who has brought cases before the interamerican court of human rights the plaintiffs’ lawyer roger kobert argues that they “stand in great fear of reprisals” and that anonymity was granted in a similar civil suit over the murder in  of archbishop óscar romero in el salvador court papers say that all ten plaintiffs are residents of acteal but people in acteal suggest otherwise the victims of the  massacre were members of an indigenousrights group called las abejas “the bees” porfirio arias who heads las abejas says of the plaintiffs “for us these people do not exist” acteal is a hamlet of only about  families according to mr arias he is certain that none is involved las abejas are hardly prozedillo—in fact they would like to see him face a criminal trial that is one reason why they find the civil case strange “blood cannot be exchanged for money” says mr arias but he adds that there is no reason for anonymity “we are not afraid of the government…the survivors don’t hide their faces” it is unclear how ten tzotzil indians from mexico’s poorest state managed to bring the case in the first place they are not publicly supported by any of the many ngos that are devoted to such causes mr kobert’s law firm based in miami specialises in corporate law it does not advertise any experience in human rights or in mexico but mr kobert says he was instructed because of his “substantial experience in litigating foreign sovereign immunity issues” he says that the firm has taken the case on a nowin nofee basis it has also hired a publicrelations firm to publicise it accusers anonymous according to mr kobert the ten plaintiffs were introduced to him by mexican lawyers but they too want to remain anonymous he says those who work in mexico’s humanrights world are puzzled “i don’t know who these lawyers would be” says paulina vega a mexican vicepresident of the international federation for human rights a parisbased ngo “the case is a political battle between different factions of the pri” says mr arias juan collado carlos salinas’s lawyer has told the economist that he “has no participation in this matter” and that he “has no personal contact” with the plaintiffs’ lawyers mr kobert has told us he is aware of mr collado “in other contexts” but that he cannot comment as to whether he is connected to the case in an email mr salinas himself states that he doesn’t know the details of the case and that “i don’t know the lawyers for the parties” he says he hopes the case is “fully supported in law and doesn’t obey political interests” he also makes clear his disdain for his successor referring us to his memoirs in which he pins the blame for mexico’s economic crisis of december  on mr zedillo who took office on december st and accuses him of “treachery” the evidence marshalled against mr zedillo so far looks flimsy a website set up for the plaintiffs’ lawyers lists a dozen exhibits which include five press reports and a  briefing note from chase manhattan bank mr kobert says that he plans to call former federal officials as witnesses but that they too must remain anonymous for now the acteal website also includes a link to a report purportedly written by a chiapas special prosecutor that blames mr zedillo for the massacre strangely the report is undated after it was published on the plaintiffs’ website chiapas’s attorneygeneral issued a statement saying that the document “lacks authenticity” and that “its origins and the ends that it pursues are unknown” in any event state prosecutors have power to investigate federal officials only for wrongs committed in a private capacity “there’s something awry it doesn’t make sense” says jonathan freiman mr zedillo’s lawyer friends of mr zedillo say that he has nothing like m at his disposal he has already had to shell out for his legal fees his good name is also at stake “those who for one reason or another were politically opposed to the tremendous reforms that mr zedillo ushered in have reason to besmirch his reputation” says mr freiman he too does not name names it is surprising that a case based on tendentious and serially anonymous accusations has even got this far this article appeared in the the americas section of the print edition tweet submit to reddit view

parents moved to mexicali baja californiacitation needed in  at the age of  he returned to mexico city in  he entered the national polytechnic institute financing his studies by working in the national army and navy bank later known as banjército he graduated as an economist in  and began lecturing it was among his first group of students that he met his wife nilda patricia velasco with whom he has five children ernesto emiliano carlos formerly married to conductor alondra de la parra nilda patricia and rodrigo in  he pursued his masters and phd studies at yale university his

article mexican general election  vladimir putin and ernesto zedillo at the millennium summit  in  after colosios assassination zedillo became one of the few pri members eligible under mexican law to take his place since he had not occupied public office for some time the opposition blamed colosios murder on salinas although the pris presidential candidates were always chosen by the current president and thus colosio had originally been salinas candidate their political relationship had been affected by a famous speech during the campaign in which colosio said that mexico had many problems it is also notable that the assassination took place after colosio visited the members of the zapatista movement in chiapas and promised to open dialogue something the pri opposedcitation needed after colosios murder this speech was seen as the main cause of his break with the presidentcitation needed the choice of zedillo was interpreted as salinas way of bypassing the strong mexican political tradition of nonreelection and retaining real power since zedillo was not really a politician but an economist like salinas who clearly lacked the presidents political talent and influence
