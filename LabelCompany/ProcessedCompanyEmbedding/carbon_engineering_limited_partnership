carbon engineering co capture and the synthesis of clean transportation fuels carbon engineering is building technologies to capture co₂ directly from the atmosphere and to use that co in the synthesis of clean transportation fuels that displace crude oil our business is to provide the technology and facilities to synthesize globalscale quantities of clean fuels from air water and renewable power direct air capture is a technology we have developed that removes co₂ directly from atmospheric air at industrial scale our technology does this in a closed loop where the only major inputs are water and energy and the output is a stream of pure compressed co ready for use or storage our system runs on a flexible combination of natural gas or clean electricity co produced from any natural gas use is captured and delivered along with our atmospheric co so that new emissions are not incurred our air capture system pairs a wet scrubbing air contactor with a chemical regeneration cycle and combines equipment with deep industrial precedent with our own novel and proprietary innovations all of this results in a technology that has low scaleup risk and powerful economies of scale about air capture ce’s patented technology integrates two processes an air contactor and a regeneration cycle learn more co₂ from ambient air video this video produced by the globe  mail explains ce’s efforts on direct capture of co₂ from the atmosphere watch the video air to fuels is our technology that uses atmospheric co₂ captured using our dac process and combines it with renewably produced hydrogen to directly synthesize clean liquid transportation fuels air to fuels uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen from water and then combines the hydrogen with captured atmospheric co₂ to produce hydrocarbon fuels such as diesel gasoline and jeta air to fuels gives us a way to produce global scale quantities of fuels that are compatible with today’s transportation infrastructure and engines but add little or no fossil carbon emissions to the atmosphere about air to fuels air to fuels combines direct air capture technology with hydrogen generation and thermocatalytic fuel synthesis learn more media and publications read carbon engineering’s features in the media and our other published papers and articles read more carbon neutral fuels are needed to power st century transportation the world is transitioning to clean economies and clean fuels air to fuels allows us to produce globalscale quantities of dropin ready fuels like gasoline diesel and jeta without the use of crude oil these fuels are cleaner burning than fossil fuels can be carbon neutral on a lifecycle basis can be produced with x less land use than biofuels and are directly compatible with

technology now proven with successive prototype and pilot demonstrations can scale up to capture  tonnes of co₂ per year with each commercialscale facility that quantity of co₂ is equivalent to the annual emissions of  average cars at ce we have been developing our direct air capture technology since  we have  core patent families and we have proven the technology with a full endtoend pilot plant we have built our direct air capture dac technology upon established chemical processing industry equipment and techniques augmented by our own innovations and ip throughout our dac system has four major unit operations that comprise a closed chemical loop which continuously captures co from atmospheric air and delivers a purified compressed stream of co using only water and energy as inputs our dac process starts with a “wet scrubbing” air contactor which uses a strong hydroxide solution to capture co and convert it into carbonate this occurs within an air contactor structure modelled on industrial cooling tower design which effectively contains the liquid hydroxide solution our second step is called a “pellet reactor” which precipitates small pellets of calcium carbonate from the aqueous carbonate solution this calcium carbonate once dried is then processed in our third step a circulating fluid bed calciner which heats it to decomposition temperature breaking it apart into co and residual calcium oxide the calcium oxide is hydrated with our makeup water stream in our fourth step called a slaker and is returned into the pellet reactor to precipitate calcium carbonate and close the chemical loop in our baseline design our calciner is heated by oxyfired natural gas so that the calciner contains co originally captured from air and liberated by the pellets co from natural gas combustion and water vapour this gas stream is sent for clean up compression and water knockout in order to produce a stream of pure co this configuration avoids emission of co from natural gas usage and we also have technical variants that reduce or eliminate natural gas requirements by substituting biogas or clean electricity more process details are available in our papers and publications but this overall dac approach pairs a wet scrubbing air contactor with a calcium regeneration cycle similar to what is used by the pulp and paper industry the industrial precedent behind our choices of equipment and process chemistry means that we have a scaleable lowrisk air capture technology that is now ready for commercial deployment as we move to commercialization we envision industrialscale air capture facilities sited outside of cities and on nonagricultural land that supply co for fuel synthesis and eventually for direct sequestration to compensate for emissions that are too challenging or costly to eliminate at source at this large scale our technology will be able to achieve costs of  usd per tonne of co captured purified and

exclusively comes from the scrubbed gas description technical fieldthis document relates to carbon dioxide capture systems and methods including lowenergy sodium hydroxide recovery for co capture from atmospheric air this document relates to causticization processes which can be incorporated into carbon capture and storage strategiesbackgroundintroductionto avoid dangerous climate change the growth of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide must be halted and may have to be reduced the concentration of carbon dioxide the most important greenhouse gas has increased from about  ppm in the preindustrial age to more than  ppm and it is now increasing by more than  ppm per year driven by global co emissions that are now increasing at more than  per year canadell et al carbon capture and storage ccs technologies target co removal from large fixedpoint sources such as power plants dispersed sources however emit more than half of global co emissions direct capture of co from ambient air “air capture” is one of the few methods capable of systematically managing dispersed emissions therefore while air capture is more expensive than capture from large point sources it remains important as it will primarily compete with emission reductions from dispersed sources such as transportation which can be very expensive to mitigate air capturecarbon dioxide absorption from atmospheric air using alkaline solutions has been explored for half a century spector and dodge  tepe and dodge  large scale scrubbing of co from ambient air was first suggested by lackner in the late s lackner et al  in wet scrubbing techniques co is absorbed into a solution of sodium hydroxide naoh and is leaving behind an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate naco for this process the contactor as the component of the system that provides the contacts between co and sodium hydroxide has thus far been a point of contention large convective tower lackner et al  and packed scrubbing towers baciocchi et al  and zeman  are the most commonly suggested contactor designs a packed tower equipped with sulzer mellapak has been investigated by baciocchi et al  to absorb co from air with an inlet concentration of  ppm to an outlet concentration of  ppm using a m naoh solutionan alternative strategy suggested by stolaroff et al  is to generate a fine spray of the absorbing solution for providing large surface to the air flow through an open tower this strategy could have the potential to operate with a small pressure drop in air and avoids the capital cost of packing material stolaroff et al  studied the feasibility of a naoh spraybased contactor by estimating the cost and energy requirement per unit co captured water loss as a major concern in this design was addressed and it was found that the water loss could be managed by adjusting of the naoh concentration with temperature and humidity of air ie the higher the concentration of sodium hydroxide the lower the water loss eg using ˜m naoh at ° c and  relative humidity eliminates water loss caustic recovery for air captureconversion of sodium carbonate into sodium hydroxide socalled causticization is one of the oldest chemical processes in kraft pulping for paper making wood is digested using sodium hydroxide to liberate cellulose and produce pulp the remaining solution socalled “black liquor” consists of other mainly organic materials originating from the wood eg lignin along with sodium carbonate to convert sodium carbonate and recover naoh the conventional causticization process using lime caoh has been used on a continuous basis for more than  yearsin air capture processes the aqueous solution of sodium carbonate and concentrated sodium hydroxide must be converted to fresh sodium hydroxide and gaseous co to be used for disposal or fuels to convert sodium carbonate to sodium hydroxide and regenerate the reservoir solution a conventional causticization technique using lime caoii has thus far been addressed baciocchi et al  stolaroff et al  and zeman  in conventional chemical recovery naco is causticized with lime to form naoh and lime mud caco reaction  the conversion of naco to naoh and regeneration of lime is a series of liquidsolid reactions reactions  to  ie all involved calcium compounds are solids nacocaohnaohcaco δh° c− kjmol co  cacocaoco δh° c kjmol co  caohocaoh δh° c− kjmol co  conventional causticization would require ˜ kjmol co for drying and heating the reactant caco to the reaction temperature and  kjmol co for reaction  comparing the high temperature energy required to regenerate naoh using conventional causticization with the thermodynamic minimum required energy given by the enthalpy of the reaction for absorption of co from air into sodium hydroxide solution it can be seen that the required energy for conventional causticization is far beyond the thermodynamic minimum ie the enthalpy of the reaction for absorption of co from air into sodium hydroxide solution for a nominal  molar solution and at k and a pressure of  bar is − kjmol co which implies that to go from sodium carbonate to sodium hydroxide the thermodynamic minimum required energy is  kjmol co zeman and lackner as a tool for air capture conventional causticization has several major drawbacks including a comparatively large demand for hightemperature heata causticization efficiency limited to  andthe alkalinity of the regenerated naoh solution limited to about  moll methods introducing alternative causticization processes have been widely investigated in the pulp and paper industry autocausticization using borate direct causticization using iron oxide or titanium dioxide or partially auto or directcausticization has been addressed in a number of literature articles covey  hoddenbagh et al  kiiskilä a b nagano et al  maddern  palm and theliander  sinquefield et al  yusuf and cameron  and zou  the term “autocausticization” may be used when the reaction product is water soluble and the decarbonizing agent is carried out through the entire pulping and recovery cycle as a caustic solution in this process the caustic solution causticized itself during combustion or gasification the term direct causticization may be used when the reaction product is insoluble in a caustic solution and the decarbonizing agent is separated from the caustic solution and is not carried through the liquor cycle in this process the decarbonizing agent is added and subsequently removedthe most commonly proposed method for air capture is a wet scrubbing technique

be separated from the first aqueous solution as illustrated separating anhydrous sodium carbonate from the first aqueous solution may involve more than one step and may involve more than one solution referring to fig  one example of such separation is illustrated as being carried out in two crystallizers referring to fig  in a step c the anhydrous sodium carbonate is treated by causticization to

anhydrous sodium carbonate can be reacted with sodium trititanate to produce carbon dioxide gas and sodium pentatitanate in the fluidized bed reactor in a step c for example sodium hydroxide and sodium trititanate can be regenerated from the sodium pentatitanate in for example a leaching unitin some embodiments referring to fig  methods of making anhydrous sodium carbonate from a first aqueous solution containing sodium carbonate can comprise the steps of x and y the first aqueous solution may be obtained from for example a carbon dioxide capture system as illustrated in figs  and  in some embodiments step b may further comprise steps x and y in step x a hydrate of sodium carbonate can be separated from the first aqueous solution in some embodiments the first aqueous solution contains sodium hydroxide in step y the hydrate of sodium carbonate can be dissolved in a second aqueous solution and the second aqueous solution can be heated to a temperature at or above the transition temperature of monohydrate sodium carbonate and anhydrous sodium carbonate precipitation to produce the anhydrous sodium carbonate the second aqueous solution may initially be for example pure or trace contaminated water prior to any dissolution of sodium carbonate therein or the second aqueous solution may have other species present therein the dissolving and heating of step y may occur in any order for example heating and then dissolving or dissolving and then heating steps x and y can be carried out in the crystallizers for example the concentration of sodium carbonate in the first aqueous solution may be lower than the concentration of sodium carbonate in the second aqueous solution an example of this is illustrated in the schematic in fig  as the first aqueous solution has a concentration of  m naco and the second aqueous solution has a concentration of  or  m sodium carbonate in some embodiments the anhydrous sodium carbonate produced in step y is treated by causticization to generate carbon dioxide and sodium hydroxide causticization may comprise at least one of autocausticization and direct causticizationreferring to fig  in some embodiments the precipitation unit may be a twostage crystallizationprecipitation unit for precipitating anhydrous sodium carbonate from a concentrated alkaline aqueous solution eg the solution of steps x and y in the first crystallization stage sodium carbonate decahydrate for example may be crystallized from a concentrated alkaline aqueous solution and in the second stage anhydrous sodium carbonate can be precipitated from a saturated sodium carbonate aqueous solution simultaneously as the sodium pentatitanate is hydrolyzed at elevated temperature in other embodiments the hydrate may be a monohydrate heptahydrate or decahydrate or any mixtures thereof for example in some embodiments the hydrolysis of sodium pentatitanate can include the addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide to the solution which lowers the solubility of sodium carbonate forcing the precipitation of sodium carbonate and will be explained in greater detail below the solid anhydrous sodium carbonate may then be for example causticized using direct causticization with titanate in the causticization unit where co is liberated from sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide is regenerated and recycled to the contactorin some embodiments at temperatures above about ° c the precipitated sodium carbonate will be in the anhydrous form needed for the reaction with trititanate thus reducing the process energy requirements the sodium hydroxide can be regenerated by the hydrolysis of sodium pentatitanate and recycled to the contactor as a subsequent first aqueous solution and the solid anhydrous sodium carbonate may then be causticized using direct causticization with titanate in the causticization unit where co is liberated from sodium carbonateseparation of sodium carbonate from concentrated alkaline reservoir solutionif sodium carbonate is going to be converted to sodium hydroxide via a direct causticization process it may first be separated from concentrated alkaline solution in a relatively pure solid stream this is important because  the causticization reaction with titanium dioxide or recycled sodium trititanate is a solid state or solidsmelt state reaction and the presence of aqueous phase along with sodium carbonate can dramatically increase the energy demand due to evaporation  the presence of sodium hydroxide along with sodium carbonate in the causticization reactor can cause the formation of sticky particles and the vaporization of sodium metal which can lead to corrosion  the presence of sodium hydroxide can decrease the melting point of sodium carbonatebefore describing the process design a review of the solubility of sodium carbonate in water and in hydroxide is provided and an examination of the influence of temperature and hydroxide ion concentration on solubility is providedsolubility data for sodium carbonate—water systemthe solubility data solid phases and transition temperatures for sodium carbonatewater systems have been reviewed and collated sodium carbonate whose anhydrous and monohydrated forms dissolve exothermally shows a complex pattern of solubility in the region in which the equilibrium salt phase is anhydrous indicated by region  its solubility decreases with increasing temperature see fig  referring to fig  regions   and  refer to regions of monohydrate decahydrate and heptahydrate equilibrium salt phase respectively transition points in the sodium carbonatewater system are shown below in table  in which the temperature at the transition point between sodium carbonate monohydrate and sodium anhydrous carbonate is ° c with no secondary solute present the sodium carbonate in the second aqueous solution may have a concentration that is at or above the saturation concentration of sodium carbonate at the temperature the second aqueous solution is heated to the saturation concentration is understood to be a function of for example temperature pressure and secondary solute concentration see fig  as illustrated in fig  the concentration of sodium carbonate in the second aqueous solution may be equal to or less than  wttable temperature at transition points in naco—ho systemphasestemp °

sodium carbonate concentration the solution becomes supersaturated at t≧° c and the formation of sodium anhydrous carbonate crystals known as primary nucleation can start at this point the transition temperature between sodium carbonate monohydrate and anhydrous sodium carbonate is higher than the boiling point of a saturated sodium carbonate solution about  wt or  m for example see fig  and table different methods may be applied to produce anhydrous sodium carbonate from a pure aqueous solution operating under pressurized condition is one way to raise the boiling temperature which may be ° c above the transition temperature which may be ° c when no secondary solute is present the other way mostly presented in the literature is to crystallize sodium carbonate at lower temperatures either as sodium carbonate decahydrate nacoho or monohydrate nacoho and then calcine the hydrates the hydrates are calcined at ° c to ° c to obtain the anhydrous form the thermal dehydration of sodium carbonate hydrates is however considerably endothermic and the values of  and  kjmol ho have been cited for decahydrate and monohydrate respectively these values are appreciably greater than the heat of vaporization of liquid water at  k which amounts for  kjmol ho an alternative crystallization method may be used in which a suitable antisolvent is used to decrease the solubility of the salt and also to lower the water activity this means that the transition temperature is lowered and an anhydrate can be produced directly at lower temperatures even below the boiling point of the solution addition of ethylene glycol by  wt for example can increase the boiling point of the solution from ° c to ° c and lower the transition point from ° c to ° csolubility data for sodium carbonate—sodium hydroxide systemthe ternary system of naco—naoh—ho has been studied and the solubility of carbonate salts in general was found to drop in the presence of secondary solutes such as hydroxide ions fig  illustrates a summary of the data on solubility of sodium carbonate at different temperatures and concentrations of an naoh solution   and  corresponding to   and  m naohin some embodiments step y further comprises introducing at least one secondary solute to the second aqueous solution to lower the solubility of the anhydrous sodium carbonate in further embodiments the at least one secondary solute comprises sodium hydroxide as it is shown in fig  in general the solubility curve for sodium carbonate in the presence of sodium hydroxide in the solution follows the same pattern as the solubility curve for nacowater system and that at the higher concentration of naoh based on the solubility product rule the solubility of sodium carbonate can drop significantly referring to fig  the sodium hydroxide may be introduced to the second aqueous solution with the addition of sodium pentatitanate into the second aqueous solution sodium pentatitanate added into the second crystallizer as shown in fig  can hydrolyze into sodium hydroxide and sodium trititanate the increase in concentration of sodium hydroxide thus introduced can then lower the solubility of sodium carbonate according to the graph of fig  aiding in the separation of anhydrous sodium carbonate in the embodiment illustrated step y may further comprise producing the anhydrous sodium carbonate and sodium trititanate together this may be accomplished by removing a solid mass of sodium trititanate and anhydrous sodium carbonate together for example in further embodiments the produced sodium trititanate and anhydrous sodium carbonate may be produced in stoichiometric ratios for efficient completion of the causticization reactionreferring to fig  the transition temperature of sodium carbonate monohydrate and anhydrous sodium carbonate can be influenced by the concentration of a secondary solute such as sodium hydroxide addition of other soluble substances eg sodium hydroxide to a saturated aqueous solution of sodium carbonate can cause a reduction in its vapor pressure which results in an elevation of its normal boiling point and a reduction of the transition temperature from sodium carbonate monohydrate to anhydrous sodium carbonateprocess design for the separation of anhydrous sodium carbonate from alkaline solutionearlier studies on obtaining anhydrous sodium carbonate deal mostly with the separation of anhydrous sodium carbonate from crude sodium sesquicarbonate or brine solution the precipitation of anhydrous sodium carbonate from an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide has not been addressed in the literature in this document therefore disclosed is a method to precipitate  pure anhydrous sodium carbonate from a concentrated alkaline solution which may be used as the absorbent to capture co from ambient airin the disclosed process sodium carbonate may be precipitated as sodium carbonate decahydrate nacoho from a for example saturated solution of naco—naoh in the reservoir eg m naco in m naoh at ° c by means of a temperature swing eg from ° c to ° c the concentration of dissolved naco in the reservoir is a critical operational parameter table  illustrates a range of carbonate concentrations in the solution as a function of temperature in some embodiments step x further comprises adding at least one secondary solute for example sodium hydroxide to the first aqueous solution containing sodium carbonate in order to lower the solubility of the hydrate of sodium carbonate in this document secondary solute may be any solvent or solid for example sodium hydroxide that lowers the solubility of sodium carbonate in water as illustrated in some embodiments step x further comprisescooling the first aqueous solution to separate the hydrate of sodium carbonate from the first aqueous solution illustrated by for example dots a to b in fig  referring to fig  running the reservoir with carbonate close to saturation minimizes the energy required for the temperature swing but if the concentration is too close to saturation there may be carbonate precipitation in the monohydrate or heptahydrate regions for example in further embodiments step x further comprises cooling the first aqueous solution containing sodium carbonate to a temperature above ° c in some embodiments the hydrate of sodium carbonate is dissolved in the second aqueous solution in step y at elevated temperature the elevated temperature may be for example between  and ° c as illustrated in fig  the four labeled dots in fig  illustrate a schematic indication of sodium carbonate decahydrate precipitation although the separation process is illustrated only for the nacowater system the separation process for naco from naco—naoh—ho would follow the

process can require that crystals be grown to a large enough size that they can be cost effectively removed from solution with a minimum of solution carryover different crystallizer designs which use a cooling process are available for example a draft tube baffle dtb crystallizer from swenson crystallization equipment can be useful for crystallizing sodium carbonate decahydrate this crystallizer includes a baffle section surrounding a suspended magma of growing crystals from which a stream of mother liquor is removed containing excess fine crystals these fines can be destroyed by adding heat as in an evaporative crystallizer or by adding water or unsaturated feed solution the magma is suspended by means of a large slowmoving propeller circulator which fluidizes the suspension and maintains relatively uniform crystal growth zone conditions another design may be a pellet reactor type crystallizer which is called a “crystalactor” and may be made by dhv water ab for example a pellet reactor type crystallizer may also be a fluidized pellet reactor the crystalactor is filled with suitable seeding material and can be used to speed up the crystallization of sodium carbonate decahydrate the crystalactor has been used for metal and anion recovery from waste water this type of crystallizer has also been studied for precipitation of other metalcarbonates the fluidized bed provides a very large crystallization surface and in a fast controlled reaction almost all the anion crystallizes directly from the solution into the crystal lattice therefore pure almost alkalinefree salt with a moisture content of only  may be produced after atmospheric dryingafter separation of pure nacoho the crystals may be dissolved in warm water at temperatures above ° c for example to a total concentration of for example m  wt at a ph level of about  it should be mentioned that in some embodiments the ph level in the process units is high enough to reduce cocrystallization of any sodium bicarbonate crystals during the process ie sodium bicarbonate precipitates at ph between  and  while the ph level for the process is always kept above  therefore in some embodiments the ph of the first aqueous solution is high enough in step y to reduce cocrystallization of sodium bicarbonate in some embodiments the ph of the first aqueous solution is high enough in step b to reduce cocrystallization of sodium bicarbonate in order to precipitate anhydrous sodium carbonate from this aqueous solution the solution may be heated to temperatures above ° c however as stated earlier the boiling point of a  wt sodium carbonate solution is ° c to avoid boiling the system for example the container containing the solution might be pressurized in some embodiments the anhydrous sodium carbonate is produced in step y at elevated pressure pressurized operation can be economically feasible because pressures as low as  bar may suffice to prevent or reduce evaporation for example at ° c the minimum pressure to prevent evaporation of water may be  bar the  bar pressure may be the upper limit for naco—ho system because the boiling point of water in general increases by adding a salt to the system the boiling point of naco—ho solution would therefore be higher than the boiling point of water crystallization of anhydrous sodium carbonate can also be accomplished by removing water using an evaporative process or reverse osmosis alternatively it might be achieved by use of antisolvents however the addition of antisolvents is probably not applicable to an air capture process because of hazardous organic vapor emissions into air through the introduction of a few percent of organic antisolvents into the alkaline solution which is sprayed in the contactorin some embodiments an alternative process can include introduction of a secondary solute such as sodium hydroxide into the solution when the solution is heated to a temperature close to but below the boiling point referring to fig  this could drop the solubility and anhydrous naco could precipitate eg dropping the solubility from point d to e in fig  in one embodiment  wt naoh is added fig  illustrates the solubility of sodium carbonate at concentrations of    and  m naoh points dg illustrate the difference in solubility as the solution increases from  to m naoh at temperatures of about ° c in some embodiments the secondary solute addition may increase the boiling point of water in addition to or instead of reducing the saturation concentration of sodium carbonate referring to fig  the transition temperature between sodium carbonate monohydrate and anhydrous sodium carbonate can shift from ° c in nacowater solution to about ° c in a naco—naohwater system with a final concentration of about m of naoh the phase boundary of sodium carbonate can therefore shift to permit the crystallization to be carried out at atmospheric pressure while still growing crystals of anhydrous sodium carbonatein some embodiments a high concentration of naoh in a saturated solution of sodium carbonate at elevated temperature is provided and disclosed is a process in which anhydrous sodium carbonate can be precipitated simultaneously as the sodium pentatitanate from the decarbonization unit is hydrolyzed to leach sodium hydroxide see reaction  the leaching of sodium hydroxide from sodium pentatitanate is an endothermic reaction δh kjmol co and experimental data at temperatures of  and ° c has shown that the leaching rate at about ° c can be high enough to produce a maximum m aqueous solution of sodium hydroxidein some embodiments the proposed process can work as follows pentatitanate can be added to the ˜m saturated sodium carbonate solution at temperatures of ˜° c the sodium pentatitanate can hydrolyze releasing naoh which drives the sodium carbonate out of solution the leaching of sodium hydroxide can shift the solubility curve of sodium carbonate as well as the transition temperature of sodium carbonate monohydrate and anhydrous sodium carbonate precipitation a preliminary laboratory study for the simultaneous reactions was done successfully and is disclosed below more specifically sodium hydroxide was successfully leached out from sodium pentatitanate and the concentration controlled so that a  and m sodium hydroxide solution was produced and the anhydrous sodium carbonate was precipitated at a temperature of ° c the more detailed leaching kinetics study and the influence of dissolved sodium carbonate are being investigateddecarbonation of sodium carbonate via direct causticizationthermodynamics of the titanate reaction has been widely studied beginning as early as  by kiiskila the lower limit for reaction temperature is ° c in order to achieve sufficiently high reaction rates due to reaction  this reaction is endothermic meaning that the reaction rate is higher at higher temperature at temperatures above the melting point of sodium carbonate for example the enthalpy of reaction  was reported to be  kjmol co whereas at temperatures below the melting point and above ° c the enthalpy of reaction  is  kjmol co the enthalpy of fusion for naco is  kjmol which is approximately equal to the difference between the enthalpy of reaction  above and below the melting point so the net enthalpy of reaction is about the same in either case in some embodiments step c is carried out at temperatures at or above the melting point of anhydrous sodium carbonateafter a thorough thermodynamical analysis it may be found that although the reaction can be carried out in solid state at temperatures slightly above the melting point ˜° c the total energy requirement for heating the reactant and the reaction is  less than for temperatures below the melting point moreover at temperatures slightly above the melting point the total energy that can be recovered from cooling of the products is ˜ more than for the temperatures below melting point this would in turn lead to  more energy efficiency when causticization is carried out at temperatures slightly above the melting point the reaction rate is also higher at temperatures slightly above the melting point which is of great importance for the residence time in the fluidizedbed reactorthe parameters influencing the kinetics of reaction  are thought to be the particle size of both sodium carbonate and titanium dioxide and the molar ratio of titanium dioxide and sodium carbonate tionaco it has been found that all of the sodium carbonate is converted below its melting point ° c for particle sizes  μm and tionaco indicating that the reaction can be carried out successfully in the solid state however when larger particle sizes eg  μm or smaller molar ratios eg tionaco were used the causticization reaction was slower than the previous cases at temperatures below the sodium carbonate melting pointbesides the parameters discussed above the partial pressure of co in the reaction atmosphere seems to influence the reaction kinetics as well the mechanism is not yet clearly understood there may be a retarding effect of co partial pressure on reaction rate a thorough investigation of the mechanism for the influence of co partial pressure on titanate reaction may be required in order to separate a co stream at partial pressures of about  bar from the fluidized bed reactor this would simplify the compression of separated co to higher pressures of about  barin some embodiments the method may further comprise steps e and f in step e anhydrous sodium carbonate is separated from a subsequent first aqueous solution containing sodium carbonate the subsequent aqueous solution may be derived from the initial aqueous solution referring to figs  and  this is illustrated in the cycle of the process in step f the anhydrous sodium carbonate separated in step e is treated by causticization to generate carbon dioxide and sodium hydroxide the method may also further comprise a step d in which a subsequent gas containing carbon dioxide is scrubbed with the subsequent aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide to react the carbon dioxide to form the subsequent first aqueous solution containing sodium carbonate in other embodiments at least one of the first aqueous solution containing sodium carbonate and the subsequent first aqueous solution containing sodium carbonate may be derived from processes other than gas scrubbing referring to fig  in some embodiments step c further comprises hydrolyzing the sodium pentatitanate in the separation of anhydrous sodium carbonate in step e to regenerate sodium hydroxide and sodium trititanate in further embodiments such as the one illustrated in fig  step e further comprises producing the anhydrous sodium carbonate and sodium trititanate together in some embodiments the subsequent aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide can be formed with the sodium hydroxide generated in step cit should be understood that various modifications and variations may be made to the design and process engineering of the system for heating the mixed carbonatetitanate particles disclosed herein design alternatives that provide for heat and co recovery are providedfor example highly efficient kilns for heating fine particles to temperatures above that required here have been developed for lime caoh production the socalled ‘d’ kilns developed by the italian lime kiln manufacturer cimprogetti have demonstrated thermal efficiencies above  in largescale applications the efficiency comes from a counter flow design in which the particles drop through upward flowing gas in the upper section of the kiln the cool particles are heated by the hot exhaust gases creating a counter current heat exchanger the calcination reaction proceeds in the middle of the kiln in the lower section of the kiln the hot particles fall through the incoming air preheating it similar kiln designs may be readily adapted to drive the trititanate to pentatitanate reactionthe most conservative and lowest capital cost approach may be to use natural gas fired in air as an indirect heat source this approach would require minimal adaptation of existing kiln designs and would presumably carry a small technical risk the co released from natural gas combustion is only ˜⅙ of the co captured from air so one might simply ignore the co produced by combustion alternatively one could use a post combustion process such as amines or chilled ammonia from the exhaust gasesin some embodiments a more advanced and perhaps more costeffective design could use recirculating co into which heat introduced by an “oxyfuel” mixture of oxygen and natural gas or syngas the design of such systems could be adapted from the many design studies for oxyfuel coal fired power plants which are now being applied at scales of greater than  mw in this case the primary operating gas would be co at atmospheric pressure or above the presence of co at atmospheric pressure may however cause problems in the titanate kineticsin another embodiment the design could use indirect heat provided by a high temperature gas cooled reactor htgr the second generation of htgr reactors is currently being developed by several companies including pbmr ariva and general atomics the first commercial scale passivelysafe pbrm reactor is expected to start construction in  in these reactors the primary loop helium temperature is ˜° c and the secondary loop temperature can be above ° c it might therefore be practical to drive the titanate reactions using indirect heat provided by the secondary helium loop from an htgr in this design essentially the only gas inside the kiln would be co since no water would be introduced by combustion as is the case for oxyfuelhtgrs arguably could provide the lowest cost source of carbon neutral high grade heat if htgrs are the power source then the titanate process described here has another advantage other than energy efficiency over the calcination process because that titanate process can be operated at temperatures as low as ° c whereas the calcination process requires temperatures of ˜° c assuming atmospheric pressure co current htgr designs cannot practically supply heat at ° cenergy and exergy analysisa thermodynamical evaluation for the conventional causticization and the direct causticization using titanates has been carried out and it was determined that the process with highest potential from both energy and energy equality perspective is the titanate process it should be mentioned that in these studies solid sodium carbonate was used to perform a fair comparison between the two processesin this section the results of the energy and exergy analysis are shown for the recovery cycle using titanate in which sodium carbonate and lean sodium hydroxide enters the cycle and carbon dioxide and rich sodium hydroxide leaves the cycle as the products the other substances are recycled between the different units note that the starting point for sodium carbonate is the aqueous alkaline solution of naco—naoh from the reservoir solution the energy analysis for the co absorption section “contactor” can be found elsewhere in this document a total energy requirement of ˜ kjmol co is estimated for the recovery cycle using titanate as shown in table  the highest

exergy calculation is taken from thermochemical database software hsc chemistry v outotec research wwwoutoteccom the amount of energy required by the titanate process is compared with the energy requirement in the lime caoh cycle in fig  where enthalpy of change δh for titanate and lime processes at corresponding temperatures is illustrated in fig  the lime cycle is presented as a dashed line labeled by numbers whereas the titanate cycle is shown in solid lines labeled by letters as illustrated the required energy for the titanate process is about half of the required energy for the lime process ˜ as oppose to ˜ kjmol co in the lime cycle the calcinations reaction consumes the most energy and heat recovery from the calcination reaction products is poor in the titanate cycle however most of the energy consumed for heating the reactants can theoretically be recovered by cooling of the reaction products it should however be mentioned that because the energy requirement for heating and cooling of reactants and products are larger in the titanate process the requirement on the heat transfer is more stringenttitanate processes may supply rather high concentrations of regenerated sodium hydroxide solution ˜m for example compared to conventional causticization maximum m for example this is because in conventional causticization using lime caoh the alkalinity of the naoh solution produced due to reaction  is limited by the causticization reaction to m for an air capture system however a more concentrated hydroxide solution eg  or m might be required depending on relative humidity rh and ambient temperature another issue with causticizing a concentrated alkaline reservoir solution with lime is the coprecipitation of calcium hydroxide with calcium carbonate for these reasons the conventional causticization using lime might not be as efficient for the concentrated reservoir solution as it is for causticizing sodium carbonate from a more dilute solutionan energy efficient process for recovering sodium hydroxide for capturing co from ambient air is disclosed in this document in some embodiments the proposed process requires about half of the energy for the conventional causticization process using lime caoh the heat requirement of the proposed process is similar to the heat requirement for the sorbent regeneration for an aminebased co mea capture system for which an average of ˜ kjmol co has been reported for power plants the heat required for the use described herein may be high grade heat another potential advantage of this process over the conventional causticization process may be the lower temperature level ˜ to ° c which may allow the heat integration between a high temperature gas cooled reactor from nuclear plants and the decarbonation reactor moreover regeneration of concentrated sodium hydroxide may allow the contactor to significantly minimize the water lossreferring to fig  an embodiment of the method is illustrated fig  illustrates a schematic sketch of an embodiment of the proposed process for the regeneration step in capturing co from air a more detailed flow sheet is illustrated in fig  in the contactor co is absorbed into a concentrated naoh solution and converted to aqueous sodium carbonate the reservoir solution is sent to the regeneration step which is composed of precipitation and causticization stepsas it is shown in fig  in general the solubility curve for sodium carbonate in presence of sodium hydroxide in the solution follows the same pattern as the solubility curve for nacowater system the higher concentration of naoh as expected significantly lowers the solubility this allows for precipitation of anhydrous sodium carbonate below the boiling point of the solutionstudies of the direct causticization of sodium carbonate with titanium dioxide have been carried out depending on the feed molar ratio and temperature the reaction between naco and tio can lead to various sodium titanates as products it has been found that the main decarbonization reaction in the direct causticization based on tio is the reaction between naco and naotio ie reaction  naconaotionaotiocog  δh° cs kjmol co δh° c kjmol co the formed sodium pentatitanate naotio can then be hydrolyzed see equation  in a leaching unit at temperatures of about ° c to sodium hydroxide and sodium trititanate the latter of which is recycled to the causticization unit naotioshonaotiosnaohaq  δh° c kjmol co the kinetics of titanate reaction on a potassiumbased process has been investigated motivated by the possibility that that potassium carbonate might offer benefits over sodium carbonate in the pulping process such as the elimination of potassium buildup in sodiumbased pulping the kinetics of the reaction for absorbing co from air using potassium hydroxide is similar to a sodiumbased process and that the rate constant for capturing co from air using potassium hydroxide may in some conditions be approximately twice as large as that for sodium hydroxide thus in some embodiments the air capture process may be based on potassium hydroxidethe conventional titanate process cannot be directly applied to traditional air capture however because it requires pure and dry anhydrous sodium carbonate and it is not obvious how to extract solid sodium carbonate from the rich solution of sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate coming from the air capture contactor this solution would typically have  m naoh and less than  m of dissolved naco a major focus of this document therefore is on separation of anhydrous sodium carbonate from a concentrated alkaline reservoir solution and preparation of a wellmixed stream of solid sodium carbonate and sodium trititanate the latter is the reagent for decarbonizing of sodium carbonate via reaction  this is a necessary step for applying the titanate process to air capture after describing the process for recovering solid naco disclosed is an endtoend energy and exergy analysis for the regeneration of naoh via direct causticization using titanate as an alternative to conventional causticizationcrystallization of nacohoa  wt of sodium carbonate solution was prepared by dissolving  g anhydrous sodium carbonate into  g deionized water while stirring with a magnetic stirrer and was heated to about ° c to assure the complete dissolution of sodium carbonate the solution of sodium carbonate was left at room temperature −° c for a day the big chunk of crystal produced was weighed and analyzed by xrd shown in fig  the weight of the crystal was  g assuming this was decacrystal the weight would correspond to  g naco which means that  of initial sodium carbonate is precipitated referring to fig  the  is almost equal to expected changes in wt  from the solubility curve if the solution is cooled from ˜ to ˜° c  g of the crystal was then heated in an oven at ° c after which the weight change was  the weight change was identical to the amount of water which would be vaporized if all the  g was sodium carbonate decahydrate nacoho this is a fair simple analysis to illustrate that the crystal is nacohoreferring to fig  the crystal was also analyzed by xrd xray diffractometery the red bars represent the decacarbonate peaks the xrd also detected monohydrate structure it should be mentioned that the deca crystallizes at temperatures of ˜ to ° c and it has been reported that at temperature of about ° c the yield is more than leachingcrystallizationtwo trials were performed with naohfinalm naco initialm in the first trial and naohfinalm nacoinitialm in the second trial referring to fig  the solubility of naco in water and in naoh solution at different concentrations is illustrated note as the concentration of naoh increases the solubility curve shifts and so the solubility of naco decreases with increasing naohprecipitationleachingreferring to fig  the goal here was to precipitate nacos from nacoaq solution with the simultaneous leaching of naoh from sodium pentatitanate the leaching reaction can be illustrated as equation  above sodium pentatitanate was prepared by mixing a stoichiometric ratio of naco and tio and heating up to ˜° c to achieve a complete conversion according to equation  several leaching tests were then carried out anhydrous naco was precipitated when a total of m naoh was leached at t˜° c and anhydrous naco was precipitated when a total of m naoh was leached at t˜° cin the making of the pentatitanate the reaction temperature was ° c and the time was  hours the expected pentatitanate was  g and the amount produced was  gin the leaching experiment a reaction flask fitted with a condenser was filled with water and sodium carbonate which is dissolved in water at elevated temperature the reaction flask was heated in a hot oil bath to the desired temperature sodium pentatitanate was added at a temperature of ° c and the mixture was heated and stirred for  hours the condenser prevented water vapor from being removed from the systemfiltering filter cakethe suspension with white precipitate produced was then filtered and dried at ° c in an oven note that sodium carbonate monohydrate nacoho decomposes to anhydrous sodium carbonate naco and water at t˜° c referring to fig  the xrd for the filter cake from the leaching test where the final concentration of naoh is m is illustrated the light blue peak represents sodium trititanate the highest intensity is at theta of  it also shows that some sodium pentatitanate might be present the xrd certainly shows the presence of anhydrous naco referring to fig  the xrd for the filter cake from the leaching test where the final cons of naoh was m is illustrated the light blue peak represents sodium trititanate the highest intensity is at theta of  it also shows that some sodium pentatitanate might be present the xrd certainly shows the presence of anhydrous nacofiltrates from filtering the suspensionafter centrifuging the filtrate a titration was performed to analyze the concentration of dissolved carbonate anions as well as hydroxides referring to fig  an example of the titration data is illustrated as illustrated the measured values of hydroxide and carbonate  and  m respectively are very close to the expected values  and  m respectively the expected values may be derived from the solubility graph illustrated in fig  this demonstrates that the experiment has worked properly furthermore leaching of naoh can simultaneously proceed with the precipitation of nacoprocess design—descriptionmethod simultaneous leaching and crystallization as shown in fig  air contactor the component of the system that provides the contacts between co and sodium hydroxide in some embodiments it can absorb co with a concentration of ˜ ppm in air to ˜ ppm in the exit flow  capture rate reservoir contains a mixed solution of naoh and naco the concentration of naoh can vary from for example  to m and the corresponding concentration of naco can vary from for example m to m depending on the ambient temperature see table  note at low naoh concentrations the contactor loses water to the air and at sufficiently high concentrations it absorbs water therefore in some embodiments to minimize water loss one may vary the naoh concentration so as to minimize or eliminate the need for makeup waterhx heat exchangerheat pump note in practice for example a combination of heat exchanger and an ammonia type heat pump may be integrated so as to minimize energy and capital costs sodium carbonate decahydrate extraction in this unit sodium carbonate decahydrate nacoho can be separated from a closely saturated solution of naco—naoh by a temperature swing which forces crystallization of the decahydrate various types of crystallization units can be used including a draft tube baffle crystallizer or a fluidized pellet bed reactor known as a “crystalactor” pure almost alkalinefree salt can be produced with moisture content of only  after atmospheric drying note the size of the required temperature swing depends on  the reservoir operating temperature and  the reservoir operating carbonate concentration lower temperature swings are needed as the operating temperature rises running the reservoir with carbonate close to saturation minimizes the energy required for the temperature swing but if the concentration is too close to saturation there can be carbonate precipitation in the contactor dissolvingcrystallizationleaching this is a hybrid unit in which crystals of

alkali metal carbonate is treated by causticization to generate carbon dioxide and alkali metal hydroxide in some embodiments the alkali metal comprises at least one alkali metal in some embodiments the alkali metal hydroxide comprises potassium hydroxide this way for example a potassium system may be used instead of or in combination with a sodium system in some embodiments the alkali metal hydroxide comprises sodium hydroxide in some embodiments step c further comprises treating the anhydrous alkali metal carbonate by causticization with an alkali metal trititanate to generate carbon dioxide and alkali metal hydroxide the alkali metal of the alkali metal trititanate may comprise at least one alkali metal in some embodiments the alkali metal trititanate may comprise sodium trititanateinfluence of temperatureas shown in fig  at ° c a second weight loss is observed which according to literature is due to reaction  naconaotiosnaotioscog  as stated earlier zou  this reaction does not occur at temperatures below ° c in presence of co influence of steamthe effect of steam on decarbonization reaction  at ° c and ° c was studied in  and  steam in the reaction atmosphere these studies concluded that the presence of steam does not significantly affect the reaction fig  shows the effect of steam at ° c as is shown the presence of steam slightly lowers the temperature at which the reaction starts reports in the literature on the other hand have reported complete decarbonization conversion is possible under steam gasification of black liquor at ° c and in the presence of  or less co in the gas phase these studies therefore suggest implementation of a steam reformer in direct causticizationgasification processes to maintain a low concentration of co in the gas phasealthough the presence of steam lowers the temperature at which the reaction starts fig a it decreases the final conversion of reaction by about  at higher temperatures eg ° c as in fig b the presence of steam does not significantly change the temperature at which the reaction starts fig b however shows that the second weight loss due to reaction  at ° c is hindered in presence of steaminfluence of co as shown in fig a and b the effect of co on decarbonization reaction  at two different temperatures ° c and ° c is illustratedin the absence of co at ° c fig a the reaction starts at about ° c which is in agreement with earlier studies and it goes to completion within a few minutes as the temperature approaches about ° c in higher partial pressure of co however the reaction starts at higher temperature eg in  co the reaction starts at about ° c and in  co the reaction does not start until about ° c without being bound by theory this may imply that at higher concentrations of co dissociation reaction  naconaocog  is shifted to the left which makes sodium carbonate stable at higher temperatures depending on the concentration of co this temperature can vary from ° c to ° c in some embodiments causticization occurs in the presence of at least  co in some embodiments causticization occurs in the presence of between about  and about  co the processes
