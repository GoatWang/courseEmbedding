depression global insurance and benefits company metlife has been about a lot more than insurance industrial properties accounted for only  percent of metlifes real estate and real estate joint venture investments according to the companys latest k office properties represented just over  percent of the investments but metlifes latest push is logisticsoriented industrial real estate development with panattoni development co with major projects in seattle californias inland empire chicago and atlanta  and possibly other locations going forward metlife announced july  it will develop a new million largescale industrial distribution park on  acres in henry county  miles south of the hartsfieldjackson international airport and  miles from atlanta with californiabased panattoni the lambert farms distribution center will offer up to  million sq ft of distribution space and may accommodate up two facilities the construction of the park will take about three years and is expected to create about  fulltime construction jobs the two companies have plans for an initial portfolio of eight industrial facilities in four states totaling nearly  million sq ft on  acres in addition to the lambert farms project in atlanta they plan to build facilities in seattle chicago the inland empire market of california and in the northeast atlanta submarket at heraeus industrial park off i metlife and panattoni intend to develop in other major industrial markets throughout the united states as economic conditions permit said robert merck senior managing director and global head of real estate for metlife nationally we think the longterm growth factors for industrial markets in core cities are very positive and we are excited to have an experienced partner with national reach in panattoni development merck with metlife since  is responsible for managing the companys approximately billion commercial mortgage and equity real estate portfolio threequarters of it in commercial mortgages as well as its billion agricultural investments portfolio in this capacity merck oversees a staff of  investment professionals both domestic and international a trustee of the urban land institute he serves on the board of directors of the real estate roundtable in an interview he calls panattoni is one of the top players in the country and theyre very good at developing new properties we saw this as a good opportunity given their expertise and our desire to build up our equity portfolio and specifically to build up our industrial assets merck says the metlife team has always liked the industrial space as in distribution centers and warehouses weve found through the years and through our experience in real estate that that is really the better investment versus more specialized rd space where you have much more office buildout the company is trying to build up its industrial holdings but merck says its difficult because typical industrial property is not that big in terms of dollars for us with an almost billion portfolio it takes a lot to move the needle so how did the needle move toward the first batch of project locations with panattoni our focus is on topquality projects in toptier markets says merck with good highway port and airport access and given the changing dynamics in the retail market these days they have to be close to the major cities physical shift from virtual lift changing dynamics is code for ecommerce according to a report from jll released in may  percent of internet customers for brickandmortar retailers utilize instore fulfillment ie using the back room for distribution thus bringing retail store space and logistics space into overlap just as they were at the origins of retail itself contrary to the usual storyline bemoaning the loss of momandpop jll says the trend gives retailers that already have prime real estate in the form of brickandmortar stores a huge competitive advantage against etailers that are without a physical presence on our nations main shopping streets the entire supply chain figures to be reconfigured says jll depending on specific regional needs and the right it investment for inventory visibility a retailer may use a number of industrial and retail facilities said the report while all brickandmortar retailers replenish their store inventories from distribution centers dcs some will also invest in or tap into their efulfilment centers ecs other retailers will use existing store inventories to ship directly to shoppers in addition to their ecs while some may add a new type of facility such as an urban logistics center or crossdock metlife may be known for its airships but its just as interested in the logistics space those airships fly above such as the burgeoning northern new jersey submarket shown below and opposite robert merck inset senior managing director and global head of real estate for metlife says industrial markets in core cities across the united states show great promise photos courtesy of metlife as more retailers evolve their shipfromstore strategy said kris bjorson head of retailecommerce distribution at jll we anticipate growing demand for both industrial and retail space in the form of ecs with a broader inventory offering and up to  percent of fulfillment space inside traditional retail locations cbres july report on ecommerce and the changing us industrial landscape sounded similar notes in noting a surge in absorption during the first quarter of  virtually all us markets were buoyed by strong demand for distribution space from the ecommerce sector said scott marshall executive managing director for industrial services americas cbre supply chain demand was centered in major inland and coastal port markets resulting in strong absorption and shrinking availability in markets such as atlanta chicago miami and houston flagler station is south floridas largest business park with its own turnpike interchange and home to industry leaders such as ryder crowley and fedex the entire flagler station complex will comprise nearly  million sq ft of industrial space once the third and final phase is completed photo courtesy of flagler global logistics the upshot approximately  million sq ft of speculative development says cbre in response to active ecommerce requirements totaling  million sq ft and showing no signs of waning anytime soon more than  million sq ft of industrial facilities is under construction in californias inland empire in san bernardino and riverside counties accounting for approximately  percent of all industrial space being built in the us of the  projects currently under construction many are specifically designed to handle ecommerce order fulfillment by  online sales could account for more than onetenth of all us retail sales up from  percent in  said adam mullen head of supply chain services cbre among the companies rapidly growing its ecommerce distribution and fulfillment operations is department store belk inc which is investing  million at a former disney facility in jonesville sc in union county just south of spartanburg with reit cpaglobal chipping in  million total employment will now come to  after another expansion just announced in december  is slated to add  jobs the company reported percent growth in ecommerce sales during its fiscal year that ended feb  big or small being nimble is what counts as it relates to industrial properties our focus is on the primary industrial markets  lainland empire the bay area seattle dallas miami says robert merck of metlifes approach to real estate we also like mexico and in the industrial space we have a good number of investments there on the debt side in addition to mexico city and northern mexico metlifes global industrial portfolio includes multistory logistics facilities in and around tokyo and some industrial lending in the uk one of those markets metlife likes  dallasfort worth  is seeing more distribution construction than any other market in the us despite having some of the most logistics space already available houston likewise is seeing increased spec activity goaded in part by the port of houstons no  rank in  for waterborne foreign trade by metric tons and its reconfiguration of terminals and channels to accommodate the new generation of postpanamax container ships trammell crow co clarion partners and rosewood property co announced in august their plans for the twobuilding sqft trammell crow company jj lemmon distribution center in the southern dallas industrial submarket class a industrial space in the southern dallas market is scarce and demand remains strong due to the efficient network of highways including i i and i as well as the up intermodal said scott krikorian senior managing director with trammell crows dallasfort worth business unit since  trammell crow has developed more than  million sq ft spanning  class a industrial buildings in southern dallas with over  million in investment the inland port at i and i is dedicated to industrial projects just like this one said dallas mayor pro tem tennell atkins it is in the heart of america it will create jobs it will grow the tax base and it will be a magnet for other class a industrial projects in another of the markets metlifes robert merck likes  seattle  panattoni isnt waiting around in june the port of seattle commission approved a lease with panattoni to develop the acre des moines creek business park where the developer plans to construct up to  million sq ft of office flexindustrial distribution and light manufacturing space near seattletacoma international airport the project is projected to create more than  new jobs and cost between  million and  million to build out in phases if youre located near a major port and you have a good highway system and good rail system youre probably going to be a good logistics market metlife merck says some are smaller but still good  memphis is a good market its smaller by comparison but weve had investments in memphis in industrial and we like that market recent research from cbre corroborates mercks point about selected  even counterintuitive  smaller markets and therein lies an opportunity a large portion of the nations industrial real estate is devoted to holding goods as they move through the supply chain writes matthew ciampa economist with cbre econometric advisors inventories were drawn down during the financial crisis and recession but have come back strong he says currently inventories among wholesalersthe middle segment of the supply chain  are at a record level nearly  percent above the prior peak reached in mid he wrote in august even as owners and tenants have streamlined he writes
