masuda esteban s   june   toxicology and applied pharmacology spleen tyrosine kinase syk is a novel pharmaceutical target for treatment of allergic autoimmune and neoplastic disorders previous studies have indicated that syk signaling plays critical roles in regulating the lymphohematopoietic system these observations prompted us to investigate whether inhibition of syk would promote immunotoxicity in a series of studies rats were treated orally with r at dose levels up to and including  mgkgday or its prodrug r at dose levels up to and including  mgkgday reduced to  mgkgday for females as mtd was exceeded a potent syk inhibitor twice daily for  days in addition tomore » standard toxicological assessments immunophenotyping by flow cytometric analysis and a study of humoral immune response measuring antiklh igm and igg levels were undertaken other immunotoxicity studies included three host resistance models in female balbc mice to further ascertain effects of r on innate and acquired immunity following r treatment expected immunomodulating effects eg decreased thymic and spleen weight hypocellularity of bone marrow and reduced lymphocyte counts including t and b cells were observed in the rat studies these changes essentially resolved during a day treatmentfree recovery period a klh challenge in rats demonstrated no adverse effects on igg or igm response r administered orally at dose levels up to and including  mgkgday for  days did not affect bacterial or viral clearance in the listeria streptococcal or influenza host resistance mouse models respectively this correlated with previous in vitro macrophage and neutrophil function assays assessing migration phagocytosis oxidative burst and microbicidal activity which revealed that r did not adversely affect macrophage or neutrophil function in innate immune responses collectively these results demonstrate that r has minimal functional immunotoxicity notwithstanding its lymphocytopenic effect suggesting that inhibition of syk might not lead to unacceptable mechanismbased adverse effects« less « prev next » switch to detail view for this search some links on this page may take you to nonfederal

that modulate processes associated with isotype switching of b cells and ige production methods and kits for identifying such compounds and methods of using such compounds in a variety of contexts such as for the treatment or prevention of diseases associated with or characterized by production andor accumulation of ige including anaphylactic hypersensitivity or allergic reactions allergic rhinitis allergic conjunctivitis systemic mastocytosis hyper ige syndrome and ige gammopathies atopic disorders such as atopic dermatitis atopic eczema and atopic asthma and bcell lymphoma background of the invention  the immune system protects the body against invasion by foreign environmental agents such as microorganisms or their products foods chemicals drugs molds pollen animal hair or dander etc the ability of the immune system to protect the body against such foreign invaders may be innate or acquired  the acquired immune response which stems from exposure to the foreign invader is extremely complex and involves numerous types of cells that interact with one another in myriad ways to express the full range of immune response two of these cell types come from a common lymphoid precursor cell but differentiate along different developmental lines one line matures in the thymus tcells the other line matures in the bone marrow bcells although t and bcells differ in many functional respects they share one of the important properties of the immune response they both exhibit specificity towards a foreign invader antigen thus the major recognition and reaction functions of the immune response are contained within the lymph cells  a third cell type that participates in the acquired immune response is the class of cells referred to as antigenpresenting cells apc unlike the t and bcells the apc do not have antigenspecificity however they play an important role in processing and presenting the antigen to the tcells  while the t and bcells are both involved in acquired immunity they have different functions both t and bcells have antigenspecific receptors on their surfaces that when bound by the antigen activate the cells to release various products in the case of bcells the surface receptors are immunoglobulins and the products released by the activated bcells are immunoglobulins that have the same specificity for the antigen as the surface receptor immunoglobulins in the case of activated tcells the products released are not the same as their surface receptor immunoglobulins but are instead other molecules called cytokines that affect other cells and participate in the elimination of the antigen one such cytokine released by a class of tcells called helper tcells is interleukin il  the immunoglobulins produced and released by bcells must bind to a vast array of foreign invaders antigens all immunoglobulins share certain common structural features that enable them to  recognize and bind specifically to a unique structural feature on an antigen termed an epitope and  perform a common biological function after binding the antigen basically each immunoglobulin consists of two identical light l chains and two identical heavy h chains the h chains are linked together via disulfide bridges the portion of the immunoglobulin that binds the antigen includes the aminoterminal regions of both l and h chains there are five major classes of h chains termed α δ ε γ and μ providing five different isotypes of immunoglobulins iga igd ige igg and igm although all five classes of immunoglobulins may possess precisely the same specificity for an antigen they all have different biological functions  while the immune system provides tremendous benefits in protecting the body against foreign invaders particularly those that cause infectious diseases its effects are sometimes damaging for example in the process of eliminating an invading foreign substance some tissue damage may occur typically as a result of the accumulation of immunoglobulins with nonspecific effects such damage is generally temporary ceasing once the foreign invader has been eliminated however there are instances such as in the case of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions where the immune response directed against even innocuous agents such as inhaled pollen inhaled mold spores insect bite products medications and even foods is so powerful that it results in severe pathological consequences or symptoms  such hypersensitivity or allergic reactions are divided into four classes designated types iiv the symptoms of the type i allergic reactions called anaphylactic reactions or anaphylaxis include the common symptoms associated with mild allergies such as runny nose watery eyes etc as well as the more dangerous and often fatal symptoms of difficulty in breathing asthma asphyxiation typically due to constriction of smooth muscle around the bronchi in the lungs and a sharp drop in blood pressure also included within the class of type i allergic reactions are atopic reactions including atopic dermatitis atopic eczema and atopic asthma  even when not lethal such anaphylactic allergic reactions produce symptoms that interfere with the enjoyment of normal life one need only witness the inability of an allergy sufferer to mow the lawn or hike through the woods to understand the disruptive force even mild allergies have on everyday life thus while the immune system is quite beneficial it would be desirable to be able to interrupt its response to invading foreign agents that pose no risk or threat to the body  ige immunoglobulins are crucial immune mediators of such anaphylactic hypersensitivity and allergic reactions and have been shown to be responsible for the induction and maintenance of anaphylactic allergic symptoms for example antiige antibodies have been shown to interfere with ige function and alleviate allergic symptoms jardieu  curr op immunol  shields et al  int arch allergy immunol  thus release andor accumulation of ige immunoglobulins are believed to play a crucial role in the anaphylactic allergic response to innocuous foreign invaders other diseases associated with or mediated by ige production andor accumulation include but are not limited to allergic rhinitis allergic conjunctivitis systemic mastocytosis hyper ige syndrome ige gammopathies and bcell lymphoma  although iges are produced and released by bcells the cells must be activated to do so bcells initiallyproduce only igd and igm the isotype switching of bcells to produce ige is a complex process that involves the replacement of certain immunoglobulin constant c regions with other c regions that have biologically distinct effector functions without altering the specificity of the immunoglobulin for ige switching a deletional rearrangement of the igh chain gene locus occurs which results in the joining of the switch region of the μ gene sμ with the corresponding region of the ε gene sε  this ige switching is induced in part by il or il produced by tcells the il induction initiates transcription through the sε region resulting in the synthesis of germline or “sterile” ε transcripts that is transcripts of the unrearranged cε h genes that lead to the production of ige instead of igm  il induced germline ε transcription and consequent synthesis of ige is inhibited by interferon gamma ifnγ interferon alpha ifnα and tumor growth factor beta tgfβ in addition to the il signal a second signal also normally delivered by tcells is required for switch recombination leading to the production of ige this second tcell signal may be replaced by monoclonal antibodies to cd infection by epsteinbarr virus or hydrocortisone  generally traditional treatments for diseases mediated by ige production andor accumulation regulate the immune system following synthesis of ige for example traditional therapies for the treatment of allergies include antihistamines designed to modulate the igemediated response resulting in mast cell degranulation drugs are also known that generally downregulate ige production or that inhibit switching of but not induction of germline ε transcription see eg loh et al  j allerg clin immunol   although these treatments are often effective treatments that act to reduce or eliminate ige production altogether would be desirable by reducing or eliminating ige production the hypersensitivity or allergic response may be reduced or eliminated altogether accordingly the availability of compounds that are upstream modulators of ige production such as compounds capable of modulating and in particular inhibiting il receptormediated germline ε transcription would be highly desirable  the ability to screen for compounds capable of modulating ige production and in particular compounds that modulate il or il induced germline ε transcription typically involves screening candidate compounds in complex cellbased functional assays such as the functional assays described in us pat no  these assays typically involve contacting a cell comprising a reporter gene operably linked to a promoter responsive to or inducible by il with a candidate compound of interest in the presence of il and assessing the amount of reporter gene product produced the reporter gene is typically a gene that encodes a protein that produces an observable signal such as a fluorescent protein the il inducible promoter may be a germline ε promoter compounds that antagonize inhibit il induced transcription will yield reduced amounts of reporter gene product as compared to control cells contacted with il alone compounds that agonize il induced transcription will yield increased amounts of reporter gene product as compared to control cells contacted with il alone particularly useful functional assays for screening compounds for the ability to modulate il inducible germline ε transcription are described in us pat no  wo  and wo   although such functional screening assays are quite powerful and effective simpler assays that could be performed in cellfree systems andor that do not require a functional component such as simple binding assays with isolated proteins known to be involved in the il signaling cascade responsible for the production of germline ε transcripts and hence the production of ige would be beneficial summary of the invention  these and other objects are furnished by the present invention which in one aspect provides compounds referred to herein as cla compounds which are capable of modulating and in particular inhibiting the il receptormediated signaling cascade involved in bcell isotype switching to and consequent production of ige the cla compounds of the invention are generally  to  amino acid residue peptides or peptide

induced germline ε transcription in cellular assays as a consequence of this activity the cla compounds of the invention can be used to modulate the il receptormediated signaling cascade involved in isotype switching to and consequent production of ige in a specific embodiment the cla compounds may be used to inhibit il or il induced ige production as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment or prevention of diseases associated with characterized by or caused by ige production andor accumulation such as anaphylactic hypersensitivity or allergic reactions andor symptoms associated with such reactions allergic rhinitis allergic conjunctivitis systemic mastocytosis hyper ige syndrome and ige gammopathies atopic disorders such as atopic dermatitis atopic eczema and atopic asthma and bcell lymphoma  the cla compound of the invention can also be used in assays to identify other compounds capable of effecting the above activities as will be described in more detail below  in addition to their ability to inhibit il or il inducible germline ε transcription and hence il receptormediated ige production the cla compound of the invention also bind clld proteins in particular three cla compounds of the invention peptide cla wt amhghhgwpwgmeqgctplg seq id no peptide clalg amhghhgwpwgmeqgctpaa seq id no and peptide clagw amhghhaapwgmeqgctplg seq id no were found to bind human clld protein hclld in a yeast two hybrid interaction assay quite significantly the ability of these cla compounds to bind the hclld protein in this assay correlates with their observed ability to inhibit il or il induced germline ε transcription these observations provide the first evidence directly linking clld protein to the il receptormediated signaling cascade responsible for isotype switching to and consequent production of ige and in particular as being an effector of germline ε transcription hence these observations provide the first evidence directly linking clld protein to the upstream regulation of isotype switching andor ige production  this significant discovery enables the ability to use a clld protein as a “surrogate” analyte in screening assays to identify compounds that modulate or regulate the il receptormediated signaling cascade leading to the production of ige since induction of the ε promoter in response to il or il is the first recognizable step necessary for isotype switching and consequent production of ige inhibition of il or il induced transcription of the ε promoter should prevent bcells from switching to andor producing ige this significant discovery therefore permits the ability to use a clld protein as a surrogate analyte in simple binding assays to identify compounds having a variety of in vitro in vivo and ex vivo therapeutic uses  accordingly in another aspect the invention provides methods of identifying compounds that modulate and in particular inhibit the il receptormediated signaling cascade leading to the

definitions  as used throughout the instant application the following terms shall have the following meanings  “promoter” or “promoter sequence” refers to a dna regulatory region capable of initiating transcription of a downstream ′ direction coding sequence a promoter typically includes a transcription initiation site conveniently defined for example by mapping with nuclease si and protein binding domains responsible for binding proteins that initiate transcription  “tgfβ inducible promoter” refers to a promoter that initiates transcription when a cell comprising a nucleic acid molecule including such a promoter is exposed to or contacted with tgfβ while not intending to be bound by any particular theory of operation it is believed that contacting a cell comprising such a promoter with tgfβ causes the activation of a dnabinding protein that then binds the tgfβ inducible promoter and induces transcription of coding sequences downstream of the promoter  an “α promoter” or a “germline apromoter” is a tgfβ inducible promoter that when induced in a bcell leads to the production of iga immunoglobulins such germline α promoters are wellknown in the art such promoters may be endogenous to a cell or alternatively they may be engineered or exogenously supplied  “il inducible promoter” refers to a promoter that initiates transcription when a cell comprising a nucleic acid molecule including such a promoter is exposed to or contacted with il or il while not intending to be bound by any particular theory of operation it is believed that contacting a cell comprising such a promoter with il or il causes the activation of a dnabinding protein that then binds the il inducible promoter and induces transcription of coding sequences downstream of the promoter  an “ε promoter” or a “germline ε promoter” is an il inducible promoter that when induced in a bcell leads to the production of ige immunoglobulins such il inducible germline ε promoters are wellknown in the art such promoters may be endogenous to a cell or alternatively they may be engineered or supplied exogenously a specific example of a germline ε promoter is the  bp il inducible fragment of the human ε promoter depicted in fig  seq id no   a compound that “modulates an il inducible germ line ε promoter” or that “modulates il induced germline ε transcription” has the ability to change or alter expression downstream of the germline ε promoter induced by il or il the change in il induced downstream expression may occur at the mrna transcriptional level or at the protein translational level hence the change in il induced downstream expression may be monitored at the rna level for example by quantifying induced downstream transcription products or at the protein level for example by quantifying the amount or activity of induced downstream translation products the compound may act to modulate the il inducible germline ε promoter via any mechanism of action for example the compound may act to modulate the il inducible germline ε promoter by interacting with or binding a dna binding protein involved in the il induced transcription or by interacting with or binding the il inducible germline e promoterper se or by interacting with or binding to a molecule that functions in the signalling cascade triggered by il  a compound that “modulates il receptormediated ige

assessing il induced ige production that may be used to assay cla compounds of the invention is described in worm et al  int arch allergy immunol  generally a cla compound modulates il induced ige production if it yields an increase or decrease in measured ige levels of at least about  as compared to control cells ie cells activated with ilanticd mabs but not exposed to the cla compound cla compounds that increase il induced ige production are ige agonists whereas cla compounds that decrease il induced ige production are ige antagonists skilled artisans will appreciate that cla compounds that inhibit greater levels of il induced ige production for example on the order of      or even more as compared to control cells are particularly desirable thus while compounds that inhibit at least about  of il induced ige production as compared to control cells are active compounds that inhibit at least about   or even more il induced ige production as compared to control cells are preferred  in another embodiment cla compounds may be assayed for the ability to modulate il induced transcription of a germline ε promoter generally such assays involve administering a cla compound to an il induced cell comprising an il inducible germline ε promoter and assessing the amount of gene expression ie transcription downstream of the ε promoter depending upon the ability of the cla compound to traverse cell membranes it may be administered to the cell by contacting the cell with the compound or for peptide compounds via the retroviral transfection techniques described supra the amount of the downstream gene expression may be assessed at the mrna level for example by quantifying the amount of a downstream transcription product produced or at the translation level for example by quantifying the amount of a downstream translation product produced in one embodiment the germline ε promoter is operably linked to a reporter gene that encodes a protein that produces an observable andor detectable signal such as a fluorescent protein specific examples of suitable assays for assessing cla compounds for the ability to modulate germline ε transcription are described in

generally a cla compound modulates germline ε transcription if it yields an increase or decrease in measured downstream expression of at least about  as compared to control cells activated with il but not exposed to the cla compound cla compounds that increase downstream expression are il agonists whereas compounds that decrease ie inhibit downstream expression are il antagonists skilled artisans will appreciate that cla compounds that inhibit greater levels of il induced germline ε transcription for example on the order of      or even more as compared to control cells are particularly desirable thus while compounds that inhibit at least about  of il induced germline ε transcription as compared to control cells are active compounds that inhibit at least about   or even more il induced germline ε transcription as compared to control cells are preferred in one embodiment of the invention active cla compounds are those that exhibit a reporter ratio of ≧ in the at reporter line screening assay described in the examples section in general the “reporter ratio” is the ratio of the signal from a reporter under control of the ε promoter in the absence of a cla compound to that in the presence of the cla compound in particular for screening in the at reporter line that has been transformed with the inhibitor peptide vector the reporter ratio can be determined from the ratio of the gfp fluorescence of il stimulated cells in the presence of doxycycline or tetracycline ie when expression of the peptide is repressed to the gfp fluorescence of il stimulated cells in the absence of doxycycline or tetracycline  as mentioned previously bcells initially produce igd and igm immunoglobulins and when induced by the proper cytokines produce iges bcells can be induced to produce other types of immunoglobulins such as iggs and igas as well for example in the presence of the cytokine interleukin il bcells produce igg in the presence of a combination of il and tgfβ bcells produce iga in many situations it is desirable to selectively modulate increase or decrease the production of a single immunoglobulin isotype as such specificity permits the ability to treat or prevent diseases associated with the production andor accumulation of the specified immunoglobulin isotype without affecting the immune system generally thus in one embodiment the cla compounds specifically modulate il induced germline e transcription or il induced ige production andor accumulation by “specific” is meant that the cla compound modulates il induced ige production andor accumulation or il induced germline e transcription but does not significantly affect the production andor accumulation of another immunoglobulin or transcription of the promoter of another ig isotype in a particular embodiment a cla compound specifically inhibits il induced germline ε transcription or il induced ige production or accumulation such cla compound does not significantly inhibit production andor accumulation of another ig isotype or transcription of another ig isotype promoter if the observed inhibition of the other ig isotype in an appropriate assay is on the order of  or less as compared to control cells such specificity may be with respect to a single ig isotype or may be with respect to one or more ig isotypes for example a cla compound may be assessed for specificity by assaying its ability to inhibit for example iga production andor accumulation or to inhibit germline ε transcription in assays similar to those described above except that the cells are activated with effectors suitable for iga switching and synthesis and amount of iga produced or the amount of expression downstream of a germline ε promoter is assessed specific nonlimiting examples

by reference  recombinant synthesis of the cla compounds  if the cla compound is composed entirely of geneticallyencoded amino acids or a portion of it is so composed the peptide or the relevant portion may also be synthesized using conventional recombinant genetic engineering techniques  for recombinant production a polynucleotide sequence encoding the peptide is inserted into an appropriate expression vehicle ie a vector which contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted coding sequence or in the case of an rna viral vector the necessary elements for replication and translation the expression vehicle is then transfected into a suitable target cell which will express the peptide depending on the expression system used the expressed peptide is then isolated by procedures wellestablished in the art methods for recombinant protein and peptide production are well known in the art see eg sambrook et al  molecular cloning a laboratory manual cold spring harbor laboratory ny and ausubel et al  current protocols in molecular biology greene publishing associates and wiley interscience ny each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety  to increase efficiency of production the polynucleotide can be designed to encode multiple units of the peptide separated by enzymatic cleavage sites—either homopolymers repeating peptide units or heteropolymers different peptides strung together can be engineered in this way the resulting polypeptide can be cleaved eg by treatment with the appropriate enzyme in order to recover the peptide units this can increase the yield of peptides driven by a single promoter in a preferred embodiment a polycistronic polynucleotide can be designed so that a single mrna is transcribed which encodes multiple peptides ie homopolymers or heteropolymers each coding region operatively linked to a capindependent translation control sequence eg an internal ribosome entry site ires when used in appropriate viral expression systems the translation of each peptide encoded by the mrna is directed internally in the transcript eg by the ires thus the polycistronic construct directs the transcription of a single large polycistronic mrna which in turn directs the translation of multiple individual peptides this approach eliminates the production and enzymatic processing of polyproteins and may significantly increase yield of peptide driven by a single promoter  polynucleotides capable of generating or expressing certain cyclic peptide embodiments of the compounds of the

that correlates with their ability to inhibit il induced germline ε transcription in in vitro cellular assays  clld is a recently described human protein of unknown function that has been suggested to be involved in methylationmediated transcriptional repression mabuchi et al cancer res   the clld coding region was identified during an analysis of the q chromosomal region the region of the most common structural aberration in bcell chronic lymphocytic leukemia bcll mabuchi et al  supra clld protein contains a methylcpg binding domain mbd and a bifurcated set domain with adjacent cysteinerich region preset domain the set domain which was first identified in three drosophila chromosomal regulators is now known to be present in many transcriptional regulators from different species hobert et al mech dev   the set protein family is divided into four subgroups based on sequence identity within the set domains ez trx ashi and suvar clld belongs to the suvar subgroup showing highest sequence homology to the setdb protein harte et al cytogenet cell genet   in addition to clld this subgroup includes human ga milner et al  biochem j  and human suvh aagaard et al  embo j  and setdb harte et al cytogenet cell genet   the cellular function of the setdb protein is not yet known as clld has both a mbd and a set domain it is thought that it might be a histone methyltransferase that may be associated with methylationmediated transcriptional repression and has been suggested to have a role in leukemogenesis based on its postulated activity and its chromosomal location however no cellular activity for clld has yet been identified the present inventors are the first to discover a link between the human clld protein and modulation of the il signaling cascade involved in the production of ige and in particular to il induced isotype switching of bcells to produce ige  this significant discovery enables for the first time the ability to use a clld protein as a “surrogate” analyte in simple binding assays to screen for andor identify compounds involved in il induced ige regulation such compounds are useful in the treatment andor prevention of diseases caused by or associated with ige production andor accumulation such as anaphylactic hypersensitivity or allergic reactions andor symptoms associated with such reactions allergic rhinitis allergic conjunctivitis systemic mastocytosis hyper ige syndrome and ige gammopathies atopic disorders such as atopic dermatitis atopic eczema and atopic asthma and bcell lymphoma  thus the invention also provides methods and kits

peptideclagw or peptide clalg suitable fragments include clld proteins that are truncated at the n andor cterminus by one or more amino acids typically by about  to  amino acids although fragments truncated by more amino acids may be used provided the fragments bind an active cla compound additionally mutants or fragments that substantially retain one or more of the biological activities of the clld protein are useful in the assays and kits of the present invention by “substantially retain” is meant that the mutant or fragment has at least  of the biological activity of the clld protein as

invention such as peptide cla wt peptide clagw or peptide clalg or another compound that competitively binds a clld protein in the presence of an active cla compound of the invention these competitive binding assays can identify compounds that bind the clld protein at approximately the same site as the active cla compound myriad techniques for carrying out competitive binding assays are known in the art any of these techniques may be employed in the present invention  such binding experiments may be conducted wholly in solution or alternatively either the clld protein or the candidate compound may be immobilized on a solid support for example the clld protein or the candidate compound may be attached to a glass or other bead or a solid surface such as for example the bottom of a petri dish the immobilization may be mediated by noncovalent interactions or by covalent interactions methods for immobilizing myriad types of compounds and proteins on solid supports are wellknown any of these methods may be used to immobilize the clld protein andor candidate compound on solid supports  the binding assays may employ a purified clld protein or alternatively the assays may be carried out with nucleosol andor cytosol fractions from cells that express the clld protein either endogenously or recombinantly  whether carried out in solution or with an immobilized clld protein or candidate compound the clld protein and candidate compound are typically contacted with one another under conditions conducive to binding although the actual conditions used can vary typically the binding assays are carried out under physiological conditions the concentrations of clld protein and candidate compound used will depend upon among other factors whether the clld protein or candidate compound is immobilized or free in solution the binding affinities of candidate compounds etc actual concentrations suitable for a particular assay will be apparent to those of skill in the art  in many embodiments of the kits and assays of the invention it may be convenient to employ a labeled clld protein andor labeled candidate compound for example in one convenient embodiment binding is assessed by contacting an immobilized candidate compound with a labeled clld protein and assaying for the presence of immobilized label for such embodiments the label may be a direct label ie a label that itself is detectable or produces a detectable signal or it may be an indirect label ie a label that is detectable or produces a detectable signal in the presence of another compound the method of detection will depend upon the labeled used and will be apparent to those of skill in the art  examples of suitable direct labels include radiolabels fluorophores chromophores chelating agents particles chemiluminescent agents and the like suitable radiolabels include by way of example and not limitation h c p s cl co co fe y i i and re suitable fluorophores include by way of example and not limitation fluorescein rhodamine phycoerythrin texas red free or chelated lanthamide series salts such as eu and the myriad fluorophores available from molecular probes inc eugene oreg examples of

described by gribnau et al us pat no  and may et al wo  dyed latex such as those described snyder ep    and    and dyes encapsulated in liposomes as described by campbell et al us pat no  other direct labels that may be used will be apparent to those of skill in the art  examples of suitable indirect labels include enzymes capable of reacting with or interacting with a substrate to produce a detectable signal such as those used in elisa and emit immunoassays ligands capable of binding a labeled moiety and the like suitable enzymes useful as indirect labels include by way of example and not limitation alkaline phosphatase horseradish peroxidase lysozyme glucosephosphate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase and urease the use of these enzymes in elisa and emit immunoassays is described in detail in engvall  methods in enzymology  and us pat no   methods of labeling proteins and compounds with a variety of labels such as those described above are wellknown any of these methods may be used to label clld proteins andor candidate compounds for example a clld protein may be labeled with a fluorophore such as fluorescein by incubating the clld protein with for example fluorescein isothiocyanate using conventional techniques alternatively a clld protein or a candidate compound produced by recombinant techniques can be labeled metabolically by culturing cells that express the clld protein in the presence of culture medium supplemented with a metabolic label such as by way of example and not limitation smethionine one or more clabeled amino acids one or more nlabeled amino acids andor hlabeled amino acids with the tritium substituted at nonlabile positions  in one embodiment of the invention candidate compounds may be screened for the ability to bind a clld protein using an affinity chromatography technique for example a clld protein may be attached to a chromatography resin according to standard techniques to create a clld protein affinity resin and this clld protein affinity resin used to identify compounds that bind the resin alternatively the candidate compound could be bound to the resin and the resin used to determine whether it binds a clld protein in another alternative embodiment an active cla compound of the invention may by attached to the chromatography resin this cla affinity resin may then be used to bind a clld protein and the bound complex used to identify compounds that compete for binding the clld protein with the active cla compound typically by washing the resin with a candidate compound and determining whether the candidate compound disrupts the clld proteincla compound complex by assaying for the release of clld protein from the resin  although candidate compounds may be screened for the ability to bind a clld protein on a compoundbycompound basis it may be more convenient to screen large numbers of candidate compounds simultaneously using one of the many library screening methodologies known in the art one artknown approach uses recombinant bacteriophage to produce large libraries of peptides which can then be screened in a variety of formats for binding to a clld protein using such phage methods very large libraries of candidate peptides can be constructed eg  peptides and screened for binding with a clld protein methods for constructing and screening such “phage display” libraries are described

clld protein can be found at lebl  leblova dynamic database of references in molecular diversity internet httpwwwzcom see especially the diversity information pages at httpwwwzcomdivinfo  once a candidate compound that binds the clld protein has been identified further assays may be carried out to characterize the binding characteristics of the compound for example to determine its binding affinity dissociation constant kd on andor offrates etc using wellknown techniques for example binding affinities can be determined using saturation kinetics and scatchard analysis for saturation kinetics the binding assay can be performed with increasing concentrations of the candidate compound which is typically labeled with for example a radiolabel competitive binding experiments with an active cla or other active compound for example peptide cla wt peptide clagw or peptide clalg can be carried out with increasing concentrations of unlabeled candidate compound and a fixed concentration of labeled for example radiolabled active cla or other compound  an alternative method for characterizing receptorligand binding characteristics of a plurality of compounds in parallel that may be adapted for use in connection with the invention is described in us pat no   in one embodiment of the invention the candidate compounds identified will have a dissociation constant kd for clld protein on the order of  mm  μm  μm  μm  nm  nm  nm or even lower in another embodiment of the invention the candidate compounds identified will exhibit an ic in a competitive binding assay with an active cla compound of the invention or another compound that competes for binding a clld protein with an active cla compound of the invention on the order of  mm  μm  μm  μm  nm  nm  μm or even lower in this context the ic represents the concentration of candidate compound that displaces  of the bound cla or other compound suitable assays for measuring such ics are wellknown  if desired the ability of identified candidate compounds to modulate or regulate il induced ige production andor processes associated therewith can be confirmed in in vitro assays such as those previously described in connection with the cla compounds  knowledge of the interaction surface between a cla compound of the invention such as peptide cla wt peptide clagw andor peptide clalg and a clld protein and in particular the clld protein amino acids involved in binding the cla compound can also provide useful information for identifying compounds that bind a clld protein identification and screening of clld protein binding compounds is further facilitated by determining structural features of a clld proteincla compound complex eg using xray crystallography neutron diffraction nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry or any other techniques for structure determination these techniques provide for the rational design or in silico identification of compounds that bind a clld protein  candidate compounds identified using the screening assays of the invention may be agonists or antagonists of the clld protein thus the identified compounds may bind to the clld protein without activating it or may inhibit one or more biological activities of clld protein antagonist or alternatively the identified compounds may activate one or more biological activities of the clld protein agonists these functional assays also provide an indirect means of assessing whether a candidate compound binds a clld protein thus the method of the invention may employ functional assays of clld activity to determine whether a candidate compound binds clld protein observation of agonist or antagonist activity indicates the candidate compound binds the clld protein although the in vivo activity of the clld protein has not yet been determined based on the presence of the set and preset domains clld most likely has a methyltransferase activity clld protein also contains a methylcpg binding domain that is likely to mediate binding to methylated dna methyltransferase activity and methylated dna binding activity of the clld protein can thus be determined and used for a functional assay for identifying agonists and antagonists methyltransferase assays are well known in the art and can be carried out as described in for example res et al  nature  dna binding assays for example to methylated dna can be carried out by methods that are well known in the art for example as described in nan et al  nucleic acids res  and the references cited therein  kits  the invention also provides kits for carrying out the various screening assays and methods of the invention such kits will typically include a clld protein and a compound that competes for binding to the clld protein

the cla compounds and identified compounds  as discussed previously the active cla compounds of the invention andor the active clld proteinbinding compounds identified by the abovedescribed screening methods referred to collectively as “active compounds” can be used in a variety of in vitro in vivo and ex vivo applications to regulate or modulate processes involved with the production andor accumulation of ige for example the active compounds can be used to modulate and in particular inhibit any or all of the following processes in vitro in vivo or ex vivo ige production andor accumulation the il receptormediated signaling cascade leading to isotype switching andor production of ige il induced switching of bcells to produce ige il mediated ige production and il induced germline e transcription in a specific embodiment of the invention the active compounds may be used to treat or prevent diseases characterized by caused by or associated with production andor

transdermal etc  the active compound may be formulated in the pharmaceutical compositions per se or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein the expression “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” means those salts which retain substantially the biological effectiveness and properties of the active compound and which is not biologically or otherwise undesirable such salts may

plastic foil such as a blister pack the pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration  gene therapy  as will be recognized by skilled artisans active compounds that are peptides composed wholly of geneticallyencoded amino acids may be administered utilizing wellknown gene therapy techniques according to such techniques a gene encoding the active compound may be

barr virus ebv adenovirus adenoassociated virus aav and the like defective viruses which entirely or almost entirely lack viral genes are preferred  defective virus is not infective after introduction into a cell use of defective viral vectors allows for administration to cells in a specific localized area without concern that the vector can infect other cells for example in the treatment of the various diseases described herein lymphocyte bcells can be specifically targeted examples of particular vectors include but are not limited to a defective herpes virus i hsv vector kaplitt et al  molec cell neurosci  an attenuated adenovirus vector such as the vector described by stratfordperricaudet et al  j clin invest  and a defective adenoassociated virus vector samulski et al  j virol  samulski et al  j virol   preferably for in vitro administration an appropriate immunosuppressive treatment is employed in conjunction with the viral vector eg adenovirus vector to avoid immunodeactivation of the viral vector and transfected cells for example immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin il interferonγ ifnγ or anticd antibody can be administered to block humoral or cellular immune responses to the viral vectors see eg wilson  nat med  in addition it is advantageous to employ a viral vector that is engineered to express a minimal number of antigens  in another

mediated transfection can be used to prepare liposomes for in vivo transfection of a gene encoding a marker felgner et al  proc natl acad sci usa  mackey et al  proc natl acad sci usa  the use of cationic lipids may promote encapsulation of negatively charged nucleic acids and also promote fusion with negatively charged cell membranes felgner  ringold  science  the use of lipofection to introduce exogenous genes into the specific organs in vivo has certain practical advantages molecular targeting of liposomes to specific cells represents one area of benefit it is clear that directing transfection to particular cell types would be particularly advantageous in a tissue with cellular heterogeneity such as pancreas liver kidney and the brain lipids may be chemically coupled to other molecules for the purpose of targeting see mackey et al  supra targeted peptides eg hormones or neurotransmitters and proteins such as antibodies or nonpeptide molecules could be coupled to liposomes chemically  it is also possible to introduce the vector as a naked dna plasmid naked dna vectors for gene therapy can be introduced into the desired host cells by methods known in the art eg

dosages  the active compounds of the invention or compositions thereof will generally be used in an amount effective to treat or prevent the particular disease being treated the compounds may be administered therapeutically to achieve therapeutic benefit or prophylactically to achieve prophylactic benefit by therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated eg eradication or amelioration of the underlying allergy atopic dermatitis atopic eczema or atopic asthma andor eradication or amelioration of one or more of the symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that the patient reports an improvement in feeling or condition notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder for example administration of an active compound to a patient suffering from an allergy provides therapeutic benefit not only when the underlying allergic response is eradicated or ameliorated but also when the patient reports a decrease in the severity or duration of the symptoms associated with the allergy following exposure to the allergen therapeutic benefit also includes halting or slowing the progression of the disease regardless of whether improvement is realized  for prophylactic administration the active compound may be administered to a patient at risk of developing a disorder characterized by caused by or associated with ige production andor accumulation such as the various disorders previously described for example if it is unknown whether a patient is allergic to a particular drug the active compound may be administered prior to administration of the drug to avoid or ameliorate an allergic response to the drug alternatively prophylactic administration may be applied to avoid the onset of symptoms in a patient diagnosed with the underlying disorder for example an active compound may be administered to an allergy sufferer prior to expected exposure to the allergen active compounds may also be administered prophylactically to healthy individuals who are repeatedly exposed to agents known to induce an igerelated malady to prevent the onset of the disorder for example an active compound may be administered to a healthy individual who is repeatedly exposed to an allergen known to induce allergies such as latex allergy in an effort to prevent the individual from developing an allergy  the amount of active compounds administered will depend upon a variety of factors including for example the particular indication being treated the mode of administration whether the desired benefit is prophylactic or therapeutic the severity of the indication being treated and the age and weight of the patient the bioavailability of the particular active compound etc determination of an effective dosage is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art  initial dosages may be estimated initially from in vitro assays for example an initial dosage for use in animals may be formulated to achieve a circulating blood or serum concentration of active compound that inhibits about  or more of il induced ige production or a process associated therewith such as germline ε transcription as measured in an in vitro assay alternatively an initial dosage for use in animals may be formulated to achieve a circulating blood or serum concentration of active compound that is equal to or greater than the ic as measured in a clld protein competitive binding assay with an active cla compound of the invention such as peptide cla wt peptide clalg or peptide clagw calculating dosages to achieve such circulating blood or serum concentrations taking into account the bioavailability of the particular active compound is well within

mgkgday or  mgkgday but may be higher or lower depending upon among other factors the activity of the active compound its bioavailability the mode of administration and various factors discussed above dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active compounds which are sufficient to maintain therapeutic or prophylactic effect in cases of local administration or selective uptake such as local topical administration the effective local concentration of active compounds may not be related to plasma concentration skilled artisans will be able to optimize effective local dosages without undue experimentation  the compounds may be administered once per day a few or several times per day or even multiple times per day depending upon among other things the indication being treated and the judgement of the prescribing physician  preferably the active compounds will provide therapeutic or prophylactic benefit without causing substantial toxicity toxicity of the active compounds may be determined using standard pharmaceutical procedures the dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic or prophylactic effect is the therapeutic index active

binding clld protein identification of potential binding partners for peptide cla wt  potential binding partners for peptide cla wt were identified in a βgalactosidase yeast twohybrid yth assay using peptide cla wt as bait and a cdna library constructed from the at reporter cell line as prey binding was assessed by βgalactosidase quantification using betafluor novagen as a substrate a negative interaction control no cdna fused downstream of the gal activation domain sequence was also run a general outline of the yth assay is illustrated in fig a following clustering filtering to remove nonspecific bait hits eg gfp and bfp singletons and clusters recognized by  or more cdna baits based upon historical yth assays and prioritization  prey clones were identified as hits  potential targets identified in the yth assay were reconfirmed as generally outlined in fig  the cdna clones identified as hits in the yth assay were purified and rescreened for interaction with the cla wt peptide in a yth assay the hit clones were also screened in a control assay for interaction with the bfp using a vector pgbkt that contained only the bfp and not the cla peptide at this stage  putative target clones remained  in order to further discriminate among the putative targets functionalinteraction profile analyses were carried out as described in copending application ser no  entitled methods of identifying protein targets filed mar   attorney docket riglus  confirmation that peptide cla wt mediates its inhibitory action by binding clld protein  confirmation of colony claygbun— as the binding partner for peptide cla wt was confirmed using the profiling method described in copending application ser no  entitled methods of identifying protein targets filed mar   identified by attorney docket no riglus the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference the functional profile was obtained using the at reporter cell line and the interaction profiles were obtained using the yth assay and compared for correspondence the main concept underlying this profiling method is that mutants will tend to act the same way in both the functional assay and an interaction assay with the target polypeptide of the wildtype peptide that is a mutant that exhibits an increase in function as compared to the wildtype peptide in the functional assay will exhibit an increase in interaction as compared to the wildtype peptide in a yth assay with the target polypeptide of the wildtype peptide stated another way the target polypeptide will yield an interaction profile that corresponds closely to the functional profile when compared visually or by other means  a collection of cla mutants was generated by replacing single or double amino acid residues in the sequence of cla wt with a different amino acid typically an alanine or glycine as described in copending application ser no  entitled methods of identifying protein targets filed mar   attorney docket riglus the functional profiles for the mutants derived from cla wt was obtained by constructing and screening for activity in the at reporter cell line in the manner described above the activity of each mutant at the germline ε promoter is reflected in the reporter ratio as described above the reporter ratios were the functional values that were used to develop the functional profiles  table  depicts the amino acid sequences the dual alanine mutations are underlined of the mutants tested and the measured reporter ratios when screening in the at reporter line table

claamrahghhgwpwgmeqgctplgseq id no  the interaction of cla wt peptide and its mutants with the clones identified as potential targets for the peptide cla wt was then quantified in a βgalactosidase yth assay the yth assay was performed in the manner described above a general outline of this yth assay is illustrated in fig b for each clone tested an interaction profile was developed by comparing the βgalactosidase activity of each mutant to that of the wild type peptide as described above  comparison of the interaction and functional profiles was performed by categorizing the mutants of cla based on the functional and interaction assays based on the reporter ratio described in panel c of fig  each mutant was categorized into one of four functional categories  reduction of function rof  loss of function lof  increase of function iof or  functionally neutral n as compared to the activity of the wild type peptide here cla wt as mentioned previously cells expressing a peptide that inhibits germline ε transcription have reporter ratios of ≧ cells expressing a loss of function mutant have a reporter ratio of  an increase of function mutant iof shows a  increase in reporter ratio and a reduction of function of mutant shows a  decrease in reporter ratio functionally neutral mutants have reporter ratios that fall within ± of that of the cla wt peptide the  increase or decrease in reporter ratio is calculated after subtracting  from the individual ratios using these criteria peptides clalg seq id no clatp seq id no and claeq seq id no were designated as iof mutants peptide clalgw seq id no clahh seq id no clapw seq id no were designated as rof mutants peptides clahg seq id no and clagc seq id no were designated as neutral and peptide claam seq id no  was designated as a lof mutant  the interaction of these iof rof and lof mutants with different polypeptides encoded by the putative target clones were quantified using the yth assay described above based on the yth assay for each putative target a subset of the mutants representing each of the above functional categories when available were categorized into the following four interaction categories  reduction of interaction roi  loss of interaction loi  increase of interaction  and  interactionally neutral n by assessing the binding affinity ratio of the mutant peptide and the wild type peptide βgal activity of mutantwild type for the putative target for the yth interaction assay mutants clalg clagw and claam as well as the originally identified peptide cla wt were used the selection criteria for categorizing the interactions is shown in fig   based on these functional and interaction categorizations graphic profile representations for each potential target polypeptide were obtained using a weighted categorization process as depicted in fig  in fig  the functional profile reporter ratios of cla wt and three mutants is plotted along the xaxis and the interaction profile βgalactosidase signal from the yth assay for cla wt and its three mutants is plotted along the yaxis the xaxis is further categorized into l loss of function r reduction of function n functionally neutral and i increase of function based on the reporter ratios as described above similarly the yaxis is further categorized based on the criteria in fig  in such a graphic profile profiles that correspond closely have interaction values in this case βgalactosidase signal and functional values in this case reporter ratios that fall along a line with a positive slope also close correspondence is indicated when the mutants fall within the same category type using both the reporter ratio and the βgalactosidase signal ie a mutant categorized as a l based on the reporter ratio is also categorized as a l based on the βgalactosidase signal in this case the interaction and functional profiles for clone claygbun— fall along a line with a positive slope each of the three mutants also fall within the same respective categories based on both reporter ratio and βgalactosidase signal the profiles for the other putative target clones selected in the initial yth screen do not satisfy these criteria  based on the close correspondence observed between the interaction and functional profiles the polypeptide encoded by clone claygbun— was identified as a target for peptide cla wt the clone was sequenced and a sequence comparison using a blast search with default parameters with sequences in the ncbi genbank protein database was carried out from this sequence comparison clone claygbun— was identified as encoding human clld ncbi accession  np— also called clll nucleotide sequence at ncbi sequence database nm—  while the invention has been described by reference to various specific embodiments
