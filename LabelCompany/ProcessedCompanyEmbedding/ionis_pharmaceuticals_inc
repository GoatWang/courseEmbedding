commercialized severe  rare our severe and rare disease franchise is the largest franchise in our pipeline we believe that our antisense technology could offer effective therapies for patients with severe and rare diseases and neurological disorders that are lifethreatening or fatal and for which there are limited treatment options according to the national institutes of health or nih there are approximately  to  rare diseases many lifethreatening or fatal unfortunately patients with many of these severe and rare diseases have few effective therapies available since most severe and rare diseases are genetic or have a genetic component parents often pass the disease to their children creating a legacy of the disease and resulting in profound effects on the family ionissmnrx the most advanced neurological drug in our pipeline is now in two phase  studies for the treatment of infants and children with sma we are discovering and developing antisense drugs to treat severe and rare and neurological diseases for which there is a need for new treatment options we have established strategic alliances in drug development areas that are high risk or in which our partners have significant expertise and resources to allow us to expand our drug discovery and development efforts beyond what we would choose to do internally for example our strategic partnerships with biogen idec and roche have supported advancing five drugs for the treatment of neuromuscular or neurological diseases in our pipeline due to the severe nature of these diseases and the lack of available treatments there is an opportunity for more flexible and efficient development paths to the market this means that in some cases the studies necessary for us to demonstrate proofofconcept with a particular drug may also be the studies that complete our marketing registration package thereby providing us with a relatively rapid path to market for potential new treatments for devastating and often fatal diseasesdrugtargetpartnerindicationpppc spinraza® nusinersensmnbiogenspinal muscular atrophy in pediatric and adult patientsgeneration  antisense drug indication spinal muscular atrophy descriptionsummary spinraza is a generation  antisense drug approved in the us and eu for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy sma sma is a disease caused by mutations in the chromosome q that lead to smn protein deficiency due to a loss of or defect in the smn gene people with sma do not produce enough survival motor neuron smn protein which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons spinraza is designed to selectively bind to and alter the splicing of a single rna from the smn gene a gene that is nearly identical to smn in order to increase production of fulllength smn protein spinraza is administered via intrathecal injection which delivers therapies directly to the cerebrospinal fluid csf around the spinal cord where motor neurons degenerate in patients with sma due to insufficient levels of smn protein the most common adverse reactions reported for spinraza were upper respiratory infection lower respiratory infection and constipation serious adverse reactions of atelectasis were more frequent in spinrazatreated patients coagulation abnormalities and thrombocytopenia including acute severe thrombocytopenia have been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides renal toxicity including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides current status spinraza is approved in the us and eu for the treatment of sma in december  the us food and drug administration fda approved spinraza under priority review for the treatment of sma in pediatric and adult patients in june  the european commission ec granted marketing authorization for spinraza for the treatment of q sma the most common form of the disease representing approximately  of all sma cases spinraza is the first and only approved treatment for sma in the us and eu biogen licensed the global rights to develop manufacture and commercialize spinraza from ionis pharmaceuticals in august  and is now responsible for all development regulatory and commercialization activities and costs for spinraza biogen has submitted regulatory filings in japan canada australia brazil and switzerland and plans to initiate additional filings in other countries in  for more information on the fda and ec approvals of spinraza please see our press releases here and here for more information about spinraza and us prescribing information visit wwwspinrazacom for spinraza prescribing information in the eu please visit httpwwwemaeuropaeuema clinical data the safety and efficacy of spinraza has been evaluated from multiple clinical studies in more than  patients including two phase  studies endear a randomized controlled study evaluating spinraza in patients with infantileonset sma and cherish a randomized controlled study evaluating spinraza in patients with lateronset sma as well as openlabel studies in presymptomatic and symptomatic patients with or likely to develop types   and  sma both the endear and cherish studies demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy and a favorable benefitrisk profile of spinraza in the endear end of study analysis a statistically significant greater percentage of children with infantonset sma achieved improvement in motor milestones compared to untreated patients with some infants in the spinraza group achieving full head control the ability to roll sitting and standing additionally infants treated with spinraza demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in eventfree survival compared to untreated patients for more details see our press release here in the cherish prespecified interim analysis there was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in motor function in children with lateronset sma treated with spinraza compared to untreated children the end of study data were consistent with the interim analysis and presented at the american academy of neurology annual meeting in boston mass april  for more details see our press release here about spinal muscular atrophy spinal muscular atrophy sma is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness ultimately individuals with the most severe type of sma can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life like breathing and swallowing due to a loss of or defect in the smn gene people with sma do not produce enough survival motor neuron smn protein which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons the severity of sma correlates with the amount of smn protein people with type  sma the most severe lifethreatening form produce very little smn protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or live beyond two years without respiratory support people with type  and type  produce greater amounts of smn protein and have less severe but still lifealtering forms of sma spinraza is the first and only approved treatment for sma in the us and eu to support awareness and education in sma biogen has launched together in sma in the united states together in sma is a program created to provide

treatment period volanesorsentreated patients with the highest documented frequency of pancreatitis attacks suffered no attacks during the week treatment period a reduction in abdominal pain was observed in volanesorsentreated patients compared to placebotreated patients in the study there were no treatmentrelated liver adverse events including no increases in liver fat there were no treatmentrelated renal adverse events the most common adverse event in the volanesorsentreated group of patients was injection site reactions isrs which were mostly mild declines in platelet counts associated with decreases in triglycerides were observed in many patients these were generally well managed with dose adjustment in the volanesorsen phase  program there were infrequent serious platelet events grade  thrombocytopenia in three volanesorsentreated patients which resolved without incident following cessation of dosing in the entire volanesorsen clinical program  individuals

amyloidosis is a severe progressive and fatal disease with multiple overlapping clinical manifestations there are three forms of ttr amyloidosis fap fac and wtttr amyloidosis and all are caused by the inappropriate formation and aggregation of ttr amyloid deposits in various tissues and organs including peripheral nerves heart intestinal tract eyes kidneys central nervous system thyroid and bone marrow the progressive accumulation of ttr amyloid deposits in these tissues and organs leads to organ failure and eventually death although ttr amyloidosis is fatal therapeutic options for the treatment of patients with ttr amyloidosis are very limited and there are currently no diseasemodifying drugs available fap now referred to as hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy hattrpn is caused by the accumulation of misfolded mutated ttr protein in the peripheral nerves patients with hattrpn experience ongoing debilitating nerve damage throughout their body resulting in the progressive loss of motor functions such as walking these patients also accumulate ttr in other major organs which progressively compromise their function and eventually leading to death within five to fifteen years of disease onset there are an estimated  hattrpn patients worldwide ttrrelated cardiomyopathy is caused by the accumulation of misfolded ttr protein in the cardiac muscle patients experience ongoing debilitating heart damage resulting in progressive heart failure which results in death within  to  years from disease onset ttrrelated cardiomyopathy includes both the

cardiovascular disease franchise we recently reported phase  data on ionisfxirx showing that ionisfxirxtreated patients experienced a sevenfold lower incidence of venous thromboembolism and numerically fewer bleeding events compared to patients treated with enoxaparin a commonly used anticoagulant these data demonstrate that for the first time an anticoagulant ionisfxirx can prevent

designed to reduce the production of factor xi a clotting factor produced in the liver that is an important component of the coagulation pathway high levels of factor xi increase the risk of blood clot formation inside blood vessels thrombosis which can cause heart attacks and strokes alternatively individuals deficient in factor xi have a lower incidence of thrombosisrelated events and little to no increase in bleeding risk this makes factor xi an attractive target for an antithrombotic drug because of the potential to separate antithrombotic activity from bleeding risk although currently available anticoagulants reduce the risk of thrombosis these anticoagulants are associated with increased bleeding risk at therapeutic doses which can lead to major sometimes fatal bleeding events in clinical studies ionisfxirx has demonstrated dosedependent inhibition of factor xi activity which was associated with significant reductions in clotting events and no increase in major bleeding events these data coupled with data in humans with little to no factor xi activity provide evidence that ionisfxirx has the potential to be used broadly as an antithrombotic in different therapeutic settings for which additional safe and well tolerated antithrombotic drugs are needed especially in patient populations that are at high risk for thrombosis and are also at high risk for bleeding clinical data in november  we announced positive data from a phase  placebocontrolled study evaluating ionisfxirx in patients with endstage renal disease esrd on hemodialysis in this phase  study patients treated with ionisfxirx achieved statistically significant dosedependent reductions in factor xi activity in patients treated with  mg and  mg of ionisfxirx a mean percent reduction in fxi activity of  p and  p respectively was achieved at week  compared to a mean percent reduction of  for placebotreated patients furthermore a decrease in severe clots in the dialysis circuit after six weeks compared to baseline was observed ionisfxirx displayed a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this study there were no clinically meaningful reductions in platelet levels and no treatmentrelated major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events for more information on the results of this study please see our press release here in december  we presented positive data from a phase

results of this study please see our press release here current status we are currently preparing to conduct a phase b study evaluating ionisfxirx in approximately  patients with esrd on hemodialysis to finalize dose selection at the conclusion of this study our partner bayer will be responsible for all subsequent global clinical development activities as well as worldwide regulatory and commercialization activities for ionisfxirx for more information about the current status of this program please see our press release here about thrombosis thrombosis is the aberrant formation of blood clots inside blood vessels blood clots can obstruct blood flow to prevent sufficient oxygen flow to tissues and organs in addition clot fragments can break off from the blood clot and travel downstream to occlude other parts of the circulation thrombosis is responsible for many heart attacks and strokes and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide current antithrombotic treatments include anticoagulants such as warfarin factor xa inhibitors and thrombin inhibitors although these drugs are effective at lowering the risk of thrombosis these drugs place patients at significant risk of serious bleeding because they target factors required for normal coagulation factor xi is a clotting factor produced in the liver that is an important component in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation process factor xis role in blood coagulation is in clot stabilization and expansion and not in clot initiation people with high levels of factor xi have increased risk of thrombosis while those with deficient factor xi have a lower incidence of thromboembolic events and minimal risk of bleeding partner in february  we announced the advancement of ionisfxirx in clinical development under an existing exclusive agreement with bayer under this agreement ionis will also initiate development of the lica drug ionisfxilrx in conjunction with bayers decision to advance these

diabetes affects more than  million people in the united states or nine percent of the population with type  diabetes constituting  to  percent of those cases metabolic disease is a very large area of medical need and is another area in which we focus our drug discovery and development efforts our approach is to develop antisense drugs that doctors can add to existing therapies to treat diabetes one hurdle for traditional drug development is that most traditional drugs cannot selectively target a diseasecausing protein without also affecting closely related proteins which often results in unwanted side effects we design our antisense drugs to target the gene responsible for producing the diseasecausing protein while avoiding unwanted effects on closely related proteins thereby reducing the risk of side effects we have reported positive phase  data from ionisgcgrrx and ionisptpbrx the most advanced drugs in our metabolic franchise these two drugs and our third drug ionisgccrrx are

are further elevated in patients with hyperlipidemia especially those with elevated triglyceride levels the most common form of fatty liver disease is nafld which is associated with obesityrelated disorders even in patients who drink little or no alcohol and is characterized by the gradual accumulation of fat in the liver or steatosis one of the key causes of this condition is the western diet which is rich in processed foods with high fat and sugar content in the early stages of nafld patients typically experience steatosis that is slowprogressing over time a subset of these patients progress to steatohepatitis a more severe and progressive form of nafld characterized by chronic inflammation and livercell damage called nash over time the chronic inflammation caused by nash can lead to the formation of scar tissue in the liver known as fibrosis as scar tissue gradually replaces healthy liver tissue blood flow is restricted which can lead to the loss of normal liver function

sma sma is a disease caused by mutations in the chromosome q that lead to smn protein deficiency due to a loss of or defect in the smn gene people with sma do not produce enough survival motor neuron smn protein which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons spinraza is designed to selectively bind to and alter the splicing of a single rna from the smn gene a gene that is nearly identical to smn in order to increase production of fulllength smn protein spinraza is administered via intrathecal injection which delivers therapies directly to the cerebrospinal fluid csf around the spinal cord where motor neurons degenerate in patients with sma due to insufficient levels of smn protein the most common adverse reactions reported for spinraza were upper respiratory infection lower respiratory infection and constipation serious adverse reactions of atelectasis were more frequent in spinrazatreated patients coagulation abnormalities and thrombocytopenia including acute severe

there are three forms of ttr amyloidosis fap fac and wtttr amyloidosis and all are caused by the inappropriate formation and aggregation of ttr amyloid deposits in various tissues and organs including peripheral nerves heart intestinal tract eyes kidneys central nervous system thyroid and bone marrow the progressive accumulation of ttr amyloid deposits in these tissues and organs leads to organ failure and eventually death although ttr amyloidosis is fatal therapeutic options for the treatment of patients with ttr amyloidosis are very limited and there are currently no diseasemodifying drugs available fap now referred to as hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy hattrpn is caused by the accumulation of misfolded mutated ttr protein in the peripheral nerves patients with hattrpn experience ongoing debilitating nerve damage throughout their body resulting in the progressive loss of motor functions such as walking these patients also accumulate ttr in other major organs which progressively compromise their function and eventually leading to death within five to fifteen years of disease onset there are an estimated  hattrpn patients worldwide ttrrelated cardiomyopathy is caused by the accumulation of misfolded ttr protein in the cardiac muscle patients experience ongoing debilitating heart damage resulting in progressive heart failure which results in death within  to  years from disease onset ttrrelated cardiomyopathy includes both the genetic form of the disease fac now referred to as hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy hattrcm and the wildtype form of the disease wtttr amyloidosis now referred to as attrwt there are an estimated  hattrcm patients worldwide patients with hattrcm begin to experience symptom onset between  and  years

designed to reduce the production of transmembrane protease serine  or tmprss to treat anemia and iron toxicity in patients with betathalassemia a disease caused by mutations in the beta globin gene tmprss is a protein produced in the liver that plays an important role in the regulation of the bodys iron homeostasis through the control of the iron regulatory protein hepcidin inhibition of tmprss leads to increased production of hepcidin which results in more effective red blood cell production erythropoiesis in the bone marrow and reduced iron toxicity in the liver as a result of improved control of iron availability results from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that reducing levels of tmprss may be an effective strategy to control iron availability improve liver iron toxicity and increase red blood cell production under conditions of betathalassemia current status the ongoing phase  study initiated in june  is a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled doseescalation study

betathalassemia intermedia about betathalassemia betathalassemia is an inherited blood disorder caused by a genetic mutation in the beta globin gene resulting in defective red blood cell production patients with betathalassemia can experience severe anemia splenomegaly marrow expansion bone deformities as well as iron toxicity while the severity of anemia varies between patients iron toxicity is a common complication leading to high rates of mortality as a result of iron accumulation in major organs such as the heart and liver currently there are no effective therapies for patients with

states a common cause of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis or premature plaque buildup which occurs when cholesterol and inflammatory cells accumulate in blood vessels researchers have shown a strong correlation between high cholesterol levels and subsequent cardiovascular diseases as such lowering cholesterol is a key component in preventing and managing cardiovascular disease cardiovascular disease is an area of focus for us we have created a cardiovascular disease franchise comprised of drugs that target all the key components of cardiovascular disease including various atherogenic lipids inflammation and thrombosis an aberrant blood clot formation responsible for most heart attacks and strokes we have designed the majority of the drugs in our cardiovascular franchise to target cardiovascular risk factors these drugs make up our lipid franchise and include ionisapoarx and ionisangptlrx recent additions to our lipid franchise are our drugs that lower lpa and angiopoietinlike  protein or angptl lpa is another independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease angptl is a genetically validated target shown to play a significant role in regulating lipid levels humans who do not produce a functional angptl protein due to a genetic mutation have extremely low levels of cholesterol ldlc and very low levels of triglycerides and hdlcholesterol currently available lipidlowering therapies do not significantly lower apociii triglycerides lpa or angptl we believe that reducing levels of apociii lpa and angptl could provide a complimentary approach to lipidlowering therapies including kynamror we are also developing followon lica antisense drugs for the three drugs in our lipid franchise in order to maximize the value of our lipid franchise while also maintaining control over the development and commercialization of these assets we have created a wholly owned subsidiary akcea therapeutics akcea is focused on the development and commercialization of our lipid franchise drugs and their follow on compounds in addition to our lipid franchise drugs we have a promising anticoagulant agent ionisfxirx in development in our cardiovascular disease franchise we recently reported phase  data on ionisfxirx showing that ionisfxirxtreated patients experienced a sevenfold lower incidence of venous thromboembolism and numerically fewer bleeding events compared to patients treated with enoxaparin a commonly used anticoagulant these data demonstrate that for the first time an anticoagulant ionisfxirx can prevent clotting without increasing bleeding two biological events that were previously inseparable our latest drug to enter the franchise ionisagtlrx offers a novel approach to treating patients with high

designed to reduce the production of factor xi a clotting factor produced in the liver that is an important component of the coagulation pathway high levels of factor xi increase the risk of blood clot formation inside blood vessels thrombosis which can cause heart attacks and strokes alternatively individuals deficient in factor xi have a lower incidence of thrombosisrelated events and little to no increase in bleeding risk this makes factor xi an attractive target for an antithrombotic drug because of the potential to separate antithrombotic activity from bleeding risk although currently available anticoagulants reduce the risk of thrombosis these anticoagulants are associated with increased bleeding risk at therapeutic doses which can lead to major sometimes fatal bleeding events in clinical studies ionisfxirx has demonstrated dosedependent inhibition of factor xi activity which was associated with significant reductions in clotting events and no increase in major bleeding events these data coupled with data in humans with little to no factor xi activity provide evidence that ionisfxirx has the potential to be used broadly as an antithrombotic in different therapeutic settings for which additional safe and well tolerated antithrombotic drugs are needed especially in patient populations that are at high risk for thrombosis and are also at high risk for bleeding clinical data in november  we announced positive data from a phase  placebocontrolled study evaluating ionisfxirx in patients with endstage renal disease esrd on hemodialysis in this phase  study patients treated with ionisfxirx achieved statistically significant dosedependent reductions in factor xi activity in patients treated with  mg and  mg of ionisfxirx a mean percent reduction in fxi activity of  p and  p respectively was achieved at week  compared to a mean percent reduction of  for placebotreated patients furthermore a decrease in severe clots in the dialysis circuit after six weeks compared to

commercialization activities for ionisfxirx for more information about the current status of this program please see our press release here about thrombosis thrombosis is the aberrant formation of blood clots inside blood vessels blood clots can obstruct blood flow to prevent sufficient oxygen flow to tissues and organs in addition clot fragments can break off from the blood clot and travel downstream to occlude other parts of the circulation thrombosis is responsible for many heart attacks and strokes and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide current antithrombotic treatments include anticoagulants such as warfarin factor xa inhibitors and thrombin inhibitors although these drugs are effective at lowering the risk of thrombosis these drugs place patients at significant risk of serious bleeding because they target factors required for normal coagulation factor xi is a clotting factor produced in the liver that is an important component in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation process factor xis role in blood coagulation is in clot stabilization and expansion and not in clot initiation people with high levels of factor xi have increased risk of thrombosis while those with deficient factor xi have a lower incidence of thromboembolic events and minimal risk of bleeding partner in february  we announced the advancement of ionisfxirx in clinical

diabetes affects more than  million people in the united states or nine percent of the population with type  diabetes constituting  to  percent of those cases metabolic disease is a very large area of medical need and is another area in which we focus our drug discovery and development efforts our approach is to develop antisense drugs that doctors can add to existing therapies to treat diabetes one hurdle for traditional drug development is that most traditional drugs cannot selectively target a diseasecausing protein without also affecting closely related proteins which often results in unwanted side effects we design our antisense drugs to target the gene responsible for producing the diseasecausing protein while avoiding unwanted effects on closely related proteins thereby reducing the risk of side effects we have reported positive phase  data from ionisgcgrrx and ionisptpbrx the most advanced drugs in our metabolic franchise these two drugs and our third drug ionisgccrrx are

liver fat individuals with excessive fat accumulation in the liver also have elevated risk of developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome type  diabetes and cardiovascular disease these risks are further elevated in patients with hyperlipidemia especially those with elevated triglyceride levels the most common form of fatty liver disease is nafld which is associated with obesityrelated disorders even in patients who drink little or no alcohol and is characterized by the gradual accumulation of fat in the liver or steatosis one of the key causes of this condition is the western diet which is rich in processed foods with high fat and sugar content in the early stages of nafld patients typically experience steatosis that is slowprogressing over time a subset of these patients progress to steatohepatitis a more severe and progressive form of nafld characterized by chronic inflammation and livercell damage called nash over time the chronic inflammation caused by nash can lead to the formation of scar tissue in the liver known as fibrosis as scar tissue gradually replaces healthy liver tissue blood flow is restricted which can lead to the loss of normal liver function

disease because in the early stages of the disease patients generally feel well and are unaware they have the disease however as nash progresses scarring or fibrosis begins to accumulate in the liver ultimately cirrhosis of the liver develops and the liver can no longer function normally about  percent of nash patients are reported to develop cirrhosis and  to  percent of patients with nash cirrhosis experience liverrelated death  currently liver transplantation is the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis and liver failure because of the high prevalence of nash it has recently become the third most common indication for liver transplantation in the us  the exact cause of nash is not well understood but the development of fatty liver diseases has been linked to obesity as the number of people with obesity continues to rise globally a parallel increase in the incidence of nash has also been observed currently it is estimated that  to  percent of the general population have

industry biotechnology headquarters carlsbad united states products mipomersen nusinersen website wwwionispharmacom ionis pharmaceuticals nasdaq ions known as isis pharmeceuticals until december  is a publicly traded pharmaceutical company based in carlsbad california united states the company was founded in  by stanley crooke a former glaxosmithkline head of research with a goal to commercialize antisense therapy the company received its first fda approval for an investigational new drug application in  marking the first time any antisense drug was approved to be tested in humans the ind was for isis genital warts drug candidate the company and others founded to bring antisense drugs to market faced early failures isis lead compound for genital warts failed in clinical trials and isis terminated development in  by that time two other companies working on antisense gilead sciences and genta had left the field leaving isis hybridon and lynx therapeutics working in the field gilead sold the patents it had developed around antisense to isis in december  isis changed its name to ionis driven in part by the negative image of isis generated by the terrorist group islamic state of iraq and the levant commonly known as isil or isis drug pipelineedit the companys first marketed drug was fomivirsen vitravene which was used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis cmv in immunocompromised patients including those with aids it was discovered at the nih and was licensed and initially developed by isis which subsequently licensed it to novartis it was approved by the fda for cmv in aug  and was the first antisense drug that was approved novartis withdrew the marketing authorization in the eu in  and in the us in  the drug was withdrawn because while there was a high unmet need for drugs to treat cmv when the drug was initially discovered and developed due to the cmv arising in people with aids the development of haart dramatically reduced the number of cases of cmv the antisense field anticipated that the approval of fomivirsen marked the beginning of a new age of antisense drug treatments that would be similar to the uptake of monoclonal antibody therapy but the next fda approval of an antisense drug came in  part of what held up isis and other companies in the field was the way that the oligomers were chemically treated to make them into drugs which prevented some hydrolysis but also reduced affinity to the antisense molecules targets around  the field was shifting to second generation modifications clinical trials of antisense therapeutics by isis and others in the early s were also plagued by lack of efficacy and immune reactions to drug candidates isis had to cut its workforce by  in  due to weak sales of fomivirsen and lack of confidence by the market in antisense technology in  isis and alnylam pharmaceuticals which focuses on rna interference partnered to form a  joint venture regulus therapeutics to apply their intellectual property and knowhow around oligomer biotherapeutics to microrna targets in  isis and genzyme entered into a partnership agreement for the drug candidate mipomersen kynamro intended to treat homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and other drug candidates the deal included genzyme buying m of isis stock and paying a m license fee as well as milestone fees and royalties mipomersen was rejected by the european medicines agency in  and again in  it was approved by the fda in  in january  ionis terminated its arrangement with genzyme stating that the drug had been poorly marketed in may  ionis licensed the rights to mipomersen to kastle therapeutics kastle paid ionis  million upfront with another  million due in may  up to  million in milestones based on sales and royalties and ionis has to pay  royalty and  of noncash royalty it receives to genzyme as of december  mipomersen had still not been approved in europe and the drug had still been poorly marketed in december  ionis drug nusinersen spinraza was approved by the fda it had been discovered in a collaboration between adrian krainer at cold spring harbor laboratory and ionis then isis and preclinical work was done at university of massachusetts the drug was initially developed by ionis which partnered with biogen on development starting in  and in  biogen acquired an exclusive license to the drug for a  million license fee milestone payments up to m and tiered royalties between  and  thereafter biogen also paid for all development subsequent to taking the license the license to biogen included
