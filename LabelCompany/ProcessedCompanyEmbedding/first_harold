of history look around the site and find what inspires you kate kelly the inventors of crayons binney  smith binney  smith was an outgrowth of a company begun in peekskill new york in  by joseph w binney the father of the man who would become part of binney  smith the first product sold by binney’s company peekskill chemical works was known as lampblack it was ground and packaged charcoal that could be used as a coloring pigment in inks and paints  the chemical company was so successful that in  joseph decided to open a sales office in new york city at that time he was joined by his nephew c harold smith  who had recently emigrated from new zealand and one of his sons edwin  by this time the company was also selling a rustcolored paint that was made from iron oxide it was frequently used as a protective paint on barns and became known as “barn red” in  joseph retired and the two younger men formed their own partnership binney  smith to carry the company forward they were a perfect team smith was a very comfortable and successful salesman and binney enjoyed working with the chemists and experimenting with new products new pigment from natural gas in the s some businesses began marketing a new pigment known as “carbon black” which was a byproduct of the drilling for natural gas that was being done in western pennsylvania edwin binney was very taken with the possibilities and in  he received a patent for an apparatus that permitted the mass manufacture of carbon black soon binney  smith became one of the major producers of the pigment  in  edwin binney was honored posthumously by the national inventors hall of fame in recognition for his invention as a result of this business expansion part of the company relocated to western pennsylvania near easton and this location opened new business opportunities  there was a slate quarry near easton and binney had his inventors working on ways to use the waste from the slate removal process they ended up creating an excellent inexpensive slate pencil at the turn of the th century paper was expensive so children used slates like small twosided blackboards in school the students used slate pencils to write on these tablets and the softer the pencil the better the marks from a slate pencil are very much like markings of chalk and can be easily using a cotton cloth–or even a sleeve binney  smith selling to schools as binney  smith began to sell to the school market smith began listening for what else the teachers needed two requests came up again and again chalk that didn’t produce a dusty mess and inexpensive wax crayons children could use for artwork binney’s staff in pennsylvania continued experimenting with slate waste and began adding cement and talc which came from a mine near easton eventually they developed what binney named  anduseptic chalk a dustless chalk the binney  smith chalk won a gold medal at the  st louis world’s fair and teachers were delighted to do away with the chalk that left a residue on their fingers and clothes not to mention dust in the air in the classroom pigment division and crayola division in the meantime binney  smith was growing into a huge company as the school market began to heat up they opted to create two divisions the crayola division focusing on school products and the pigment division that created colors for industrial use the pigment division exploded first in  binney  smith got an order from bf goodrich for an annual supply of one million pounds of carbon black tire companies saw that black tires looked better but more important by adding the black pigment to their tires it greatly extended the life and durability of the tire crayola division grows wax crayons existed before binney  smith but most were for artists and were expensive some had toxic elements added to achieve certain colors for the school market binney  smith knew the product had to be safe for children to work with they had created their own marking crayon because they had needed a simple way to label barrels and boxes in their manufacturing plant the “staonal stayonall” marking crayon was a good product but had certain elements that needed to be removed for it be childfriendly  binney guided his team to work on substitutions for the toxic pigments by  they were satisfied and binney  smith produced their first box of eight colorful crayons for children the box cost a nickel and the crayons contained were red orange yellow green blue violet brown and black  each crayon was wrapped in paper and labeled as to color during the depression binney  smith hired farm families to handletter the papers and wrap the crayons this provided work in an economic downturn and over time certain farms became known for their color specialty binney  smith and the crayola name alice binney who was a former teacher is credited with coming up with the crayola name under which the crayons were released “craie” means chalk in french and “ola” was a shortened form of the french word “oléagineux” which means oily the crayola division continued to add products by  they had developed a more elegant crayon crayola rubens for the art student over time they added colored pencils and markers but the big seller has always been crayons in  the box was expanded to hold  colors placed in a box with “stadium seating” and in  the classic color box was introduced with a builtin sharpener  in  ninetysix colors were packaged into what they called the big box while companies are always cautious about changing a successful product crayola has been around for so many years that changes are inevitable the company has added colors and has also had to respond to public pressure on certain names  in  they renamed the “flesh” crayon “peach” in recognition that there are many colors of flesh the public also objected to “indian red” though the company explained it was a reference a red dye in india no matter the public wanted a new name indian red was changed to chestnut  teachers also pointed out that “prussian blue” was meaningless to children prussia had ceased to exist in  so they renamed the blue midnight blue involving the public the crayola company has long recognized the importance of public opinion and that has surely been part of their success in  they were bringing out some new colors so they ran a “name the new colors contest” that had almost  million entries  the oldest winner was an yearold woman who submitted “purple mountain’s majesty” for a new shade of purple and the youngest was  who submitted “razzmatazz” for the raspberry red crayon to read all the new color names and their winners click here eight years later the company wanted to know the most popular color in  they conducted the crayola color census and the undisputed winner was the color blue runnersup were various shades of blue the name crayola is recognized by  percent of american households and while crayons are still their primary product they now sell many forms of craft products  they also own manufacturing rights for magic markers and purchased silly putty in  in  the company became publicly held and  in  binney  smith became a whollyowned subsidiary of hallmark in  they changed their name to crayola llc as a wellknown consumer company crayola has capitalized on their popularity there are two museums the crayola experience dedicated to children and creativity one is in downtown easton near the factory the other is in orlando florida how are crayons made of course one question people always want to know is “how are crayons made” surprisingly the method used today is similar to what was used long ago but now it is automated  the factory can produce  crayons a minute there are some good youtube videos put out by the company that tell the story of crayon production the youtube video i would recommend is not the most recent but it’s short and succinct binney  smith the people as the founders became wealthy both made good use of their time and their money edwin binney who with his family had gravitated north of peekskill to make his home in old greenwich connecticut was a contributing member of that community as well as one in st lucie county florida eastern coast of florida north of boca raton where he spent winters in both communities he was wellrespected in greenwich there is a binney lane that runs right down to the water and in st lucie county he is credited with having had the vision to turn fort pierce into a port now called port lucie harold smith stayed in the new york city area and he was active in many civic organizations including the union league club of new york the transportation club the upton club and the hudson river country club for another interesting

harold adams innis november   – november   was a professor of political economy at the university of toronto and the author of seminal works on canadian economic history and on media and communication theory he helped develop the staples thesis which holds that canadas culture political history and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur fish wood wheat mined metals and fossil fuels harold inniss classic study the fur trade in canada  draws sweeping conclusions about the complex and frequently devastating effects of the fur trade on aboriginal peoples about how furs as staple products induced an enduring economic dependence among the european immigrants who settled in the new colony and about how the fur trade ultimately shaped canadas political destiny contents  the fur trade in canada  introduction  fur trade history  furs culture and technology  economic effects of staple products  canada as a marginal colony  concept of cyclonics  politics and the staples trade  assessment  notes the fur trade in canadaedit introductionedit harold innis begins the fur trade in canada with a brief chapter on the beaver which became a much desired fur due to the popularity of the beaver hat in european society he remarks that it is impossible to understand the developments of the fur trade or of canadian history without some knowledge of the beavers life and habits biographer john watson notes that innis was following an analytical approach he had learned during his postgraduate work at the university of chicago in such case studies innis had been taught it was necessary to understand the nature of a commodity or staple product and to adopt a comprehensive view of it by studying its geography since first nations cultures and ways of life are intrinsically tied to landscape it was their techniques of hunting and preparation coupled with geography that essentially determined the development of the fur trade  in the case of the beaver the techniques for creating the best quality of beaver pelt hats included the age of the animal and what time of year the beaver was killed thus innis notes that the most valuable beaver fur was to be found north of the st lawrence river especially in the deciduous forests of the precambrian shield with its abundance of waterways he suggests that beaver fur could be carried long distances because the pelt of the average adult weighed less than two pounds the animal itself was a good source of food innis points out that the beaver migrates very little and travels over land very slowly although beavers reproduce prolifically it takes them more than two years to mature these biological characteristics made their destruction in great numbers inevitable especially after indian hunters acquired european axes that could chop through beaver lodges and dams european guns knives and spears also made the sedentary beaver easy prey innis concludes his introduction by noting that as beaver populations were destroyed in eastern areas traders were forced to push north and west in search of new sources of supply the problem of the fur trade he writes became one of organizing the transport of supplies and furs over increasingly greater distances in this movement the waterways of the beaver areas were of primary importance and occupied a vital position in the economic development of northern north america fur trade historyedit the neutrality of this article is disputed relevant discussion may be found on the talk page please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met july  learn how and when to remove this template message harold innis meticulously traces the fur trade over more than four centuries from the early th century to the s it is a story filled with military conflict between french and english imperial forces and among warring indian tribes it is also a tale of shrewd barter and commercial rivalry yet innis the economic historian tells the story in  pages of dry eurocentric and dense prose packed with statistics ruperts land the territory controlled by the hudsons bay company under its royal charter of  the company eventually ruled an area stretching from labrador to the pacific innis begins by chronicling the first contacts between european fishing fleets and eastern native tribes in the early th century after the founding of the french settlement at quebec in  by samuel de champlain the colony known as new france depended on furs for its economic survival champlain joined forces with the huron confederacy and its tribal allies against the iroquois confederacy in the long struggle to control the fur trade as new france grew french colonists first known as coureurs de bois and later voyageurs travelled north and west from montreal in search of new supplies while their british rivals set up northern trading posts run by the hudsons bay company the commercial rivalry continued after the british conquest of new france in  with the establishment of the north west company by a group of bilingual scottish gaelicenglishspeaking montreal merchants who had come to british north america from the scottish highlands in the wake of the defeat of the jacobites at the battle of culloden and the incipient beginnings of the highland clearances the two companies built trading posts far west of lake superior and hudson bay but the norwesters were more aggressive as they travelled north to the arctic ocean via the mackenzie river and west to the pacific the fierce competition ended in  with the amalgamation of the companies into a hudsons bay company monopoly the company finally surrendered its northwestern empire when it sold its land to canada in  following the decrease in profits and demand for furs innis rounds out the story by documenting the decline of the fur trade monopoly as silk hats and fancier fox fur displaced beaver the coming of steam boats to the west and the building of railways brought increasing competition from independent traders and new companies from the american west as well as firms from winnipeg edmonton and vancouver improved transportation also brought increased control of the trade and cheaper goods increased control led to more inspections better accounting conservative policies decreased aggression and expansion of districts problems that arose included the difficulty in monitoring large districts and policies that were sometimes too rigid the increase in agriculture also brought competition through decreased reliance on game for food innis ends by noting that in  the hudsons bay company announced it had invested in two fox farms in prince edward island making the outlook for the trade in wild fur increasingly uncertain the time would appear to have arrived innis writes for a competent survey of the problems of the trade looking to the conservation of one of canadas important natural resources indeed in the end there was an abundance of goods and a lack of furs suggesting the trade was no longer a major part of the economy furs culture and technologyedit inniss account of the fur trade as the history of contact between two civilizations the european and the north american focuses on the radical effects of new techniques and technologies the trade became important in the late th century when the beaver hat a new style of waterproof headgear became popular among welldressed european gentlemen innis stresses however that the trade was propelled by native peoples intense demand for european manufactured goods a beaver felt hat the importance of iron to a culture dependent on bone wood bark and stone can only be suggested the cumbersome method of cooking in wooden vessels with heated stones was displaced by portable kettles work could be carried out with greater effectiveness with iron axes and hatchets and sewing became much less difficult with awls than it had been with bone needles to the indians iron and iron manufactures were of prime importance the french were the gens du fer muskets knives and metal spears also made hunting easier and more efficient but innis points out that the convenience of european manufactured goods came at a high price the native peoples became dependent on european traders for fresh supplies ammunition and spare parts more efficient hunting with guns led to the extermination of the beaver and the need to push into new hunting territories in search of more furs this competition led to outbreaks of fighting wars between tribes which with bows and arrows had not been strenuous innis writes conducted with guns were disastrous everything was made worse because native peoples had no immunity to european diseases such as smallpox which continually ravaged their communities decimating whole populations finally european rum brandy and strong wine brought illness conflict and addiction again and again innis draws attention to what he sees as the disastrous and catastrophic effects of the contact between a more technologically advanced european civilization and traditional native societies he writes that the aboriginal peoples dependence on the trade in beaver pelts to secure european iron goods disturbed the balance which had grown up previous to the coming of the european decades later innis would return to this concept of balance in his communications writings just as aboriginal peoples depended on imported manufactured goods european traders relied for their survival on native tools and techniques birchbark canoes enabled traders to travel in spring summer and fall snowshoes and toboggans made winter travel possible while indian corn pemmican and wild game provided sustenance and clothing equally important innis notes was the natives thorough knowledge of woodland territories and the habits of the animals they hunted biographer john watson argues that in his study of the fur trade innis broke new ground by making cultural factors central to economic development in watsons terms the fur trade in canada is a complex analysis of three distinct cultural groups metropolitan european customers who bought expensive beaver hats colonial settlers who traded beaver fur for goods from their home countries and indigenous peoples who came to depend on european ironage technologies also innis notes the dependence of traders on first nations peoples and suggests their dominance in early trading when he writes the trade in furs was stimulated by french traders who rapidly acquired an intimate knowledge of the indians language customs and habits of life  the trader encouraged the best hunters exhorted the indians to hunt beaver and directed their fleets of canoes to the rendezvous alliances were formed and wars were favoured to increase the supply of fur goods were traded that would encourage the indian to hunt beaver innis writes that the french used christianity to make first nations more amenable to trade they encouraged war or promoted peace as ways of winning first nations support he notes these policies led to an increase in the overhead costs of trade that decreased profits and encouraged the growth of monopolies economic effects of staple productsedit canada as a marginal colonyedit inniss page conclusion to the fur trade in canada explains the significance of staple products such as furs to colonial development it also explores the effects of the staples trade on the more technologically advanced home countries of france and britain fundamentally the civilization of north america is the civilization of europe innis writes and the interest of this volume is primarily in the effects of a vast new land area on european civilization he notes that european settlers in north america survived by borrowing the cultural traits of the indigenous peoples but also sought to maintain european standards of living by exporting goods not available in the home country in exchange for manufactured products in canadas case the first such goods were the staples cod fish and beaver fur later staples included lumber pulp and paper wheat gold nickel and other metals innis maintains that this twoway trade had significant effects the colony put its energies into producing staples while the mother country manufactured finished products thus the staples trade promoted industrial development in europe while the colony remained tied to the production of raw materials as time passed colonial agriculture industry transportation trade finance and government activities tended to be subordinated to the production of staple commodities for industrial britain and later for the rapidly developing united states this cumulative dependence on staples relegated canadians to the status of hewers of wood and drawers of water the economic history of canada has been dominated by the discrepancy between the centre and margin of western civilization innis concludes for him as biographer donald creighton points out canadas economic axis began as a great competitive eastwest trading system founded on the st lawrence river and the great lakes one end of which lay in the metropolitan centres of western europe and the other in the hinterland of north america it was a transoceanic as well as a transcontinental system concept of cyclonicsedit innis argued that a country dependent on the export of staple products would always be vulnerable both to disruptions in the sources of supply and to the whims of export markets in the case of beaver fur for example a slight change in fashion in sophisticated metropolitan centres like london and paris could have devastating effects in a marginal backwoods colony dependent on exporting staples innis developed the concept of cyclonics to explain the disruptions that occurred when new technologies led to the rapid exploitation and then exhaustion of staple commodities europeanmade guns for example increased the efficiency of beaver hunting but led to the animals rapid extermination forcing traders into costly longdistance searches for new sources of supply later the decline of the white pine a vital commodity in the lumber trade forced the shift to pulp and paper production based on abundant spruce shifts from one staple to another led to constant economic cyclones canadians have exhausted their energies innis wrote in  in opening up the west in developing mines hydroelectric power and pulp and paper mills of the canadian shield in building transcontinental railways grain elevators and cities harold innis argues that the need to pay for costly railways led to canadian confederation in  for innis imported industrial techniques led to rapid resource exploitation overproduction waste depletion and economic collapse these were the problems of economically marginal staplesproducing countries like canada politics and the staples tradeedit innis famously writes that canada emerged not in spite of geography but because of it the countrys boundaries roughly coincide he argues with the furtrading areas of northern north america certainly the increased demand for furs such as beaver resulted in increased exploration westward innis maintains that the shift from furs to lumber led to european immigration and the rapid settling of the west the coffin ships that carried the lumber to europe brought back emigrants as a return cargo the export of lumber and later wheat required improvements in transportation  the construction of canals and the building of railways the costs of these transportation improvements were largely responsible he writes for the act of union joining upper and lower canada in  and the political confederation of ontario quebec new brunswick and nova scotia in  economic reliance on staples production in a vast country led to the development of centralized banking a strong federal government and the combination of government ownership and private enterprise which has been a further characteristic of canadian development through the encouragement of the monopoly of the hudsons bay company is born centralized control use of military aggression and hints of nationalism  innis concludes that the maintenance of ties with france and britain encouraged a diversity of institutions and greater tolerance adding that canada has remained fundamentally a product of europe assessmentedit historian carl berger notes that it took  years to sell the first thousand copies of the fur trade in canada yet he writes the book is one of the few in canadian historical literature that deserves to be described as seminal according to berger innis showed that canada was far from a fragile political creation and that its existence represented the triumph of human will and determination he replaced this old and familiar truism with the idea that river systems and the canadian shield imposed a geographic unity and that confederation was in a sense a political reflection of the natural coherence of northern america berger adds that in exploring the links between economic changes and political developments inniss insights pointed to a general reinterpretation of canadian history innis also placed indian culture at the centre of his study of the fur trade and was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of native society under the thrust of european capitalism unlike other historians innis emphasized the contributions of first nations peoples we have not yet realized he writes that the indian and his culture were fundamental to the growth of canadian institutions berger refers to the sense of fatalism and determinism in inniss economic history adding that for innis material realities determined history not language religion or social beliefs his history as history was dehumanized berger adds biographer john watson argues however that the fur trade in canada is more complex more universal and less rigidly deterministic than commonly accepted watson points for example to inniss central concern with the role of culture in economic history and his awareness of cultural disintegration under the impact of advanced technologies innis never uses the staple as anything more than a focusing point around which to examine the interplay of cultures and empires he writes notesedit  easterbrook wt and watkins mh  the staple approach in approaches to canadian economic history ottawa carleton library series carleton university press pp   innis harold

biographer john watson notes that innis was following an analytical approach he had learned during his postgraduate work at the university of chicago in such case studies innis had been taught it was necessary to understand the nature of a commodity or staple product and to adopt a comprehensive view of it by studying its geography since first nations cultures and ways of life are intrinsically tied to landscape it was their techniques of hunting and preparation coupled with geography that essentially determined the development of the fur trade  in the case of the beaver the techniques for creating the best quality of beaver pelt hats included the age of the animal and what time of year the beaver was killed thus innis notes that the most valuable beaver fur was to be found north of the st lawrence river especially in the deciduous forests of the precambrian shield with its abundance of waterways he suggests that beaver fur could be carried long distances because the pelt of the average adult weighed less than two pounds the animal itself was a good source of food innis points out that the beaver migrates very little and travels over land very slowly although beavers reproduce prolifically it takes them more than two years to mature these biological characteristics made their destruction in great numbers inevitable especially after indian hunters acquired european axes that could chop through beaver lodges and dams european guns knives and spears also made the sedentary beaver easy prey innis concludes his introduction by noting that as beaver populations were destroyed in eastern areas traders were forced to push north and west in search of new sources of supply the problem of the fur trade he writes became one of organizing the transport of supplies and

conflict between french and english imperial forces and among warring indian tribes it is also a tale of shrewd barter and commercial rivalry yet innis the economic historian tells the story in  pages of dry eurocentric and dense prose packed with statistics ruperts land the territory controlled by the hudsons bay company under its royal charter of  the company eventually ruled an area stretching

against the iroquois confederacy in the long struggle to control the fur trade as new france grew french colonists first known as coureurs de bois and later voyageurs travelled north and west from montreal in search of new supplies while their british rivals set up northern trading posts run by the hudsons bay company the commercial rivalry continued after the british conquest of new france in  with the establishment of the north west company by a group of bilingual scottish gaelicenglishspeaking montreal merchants who had come to british north america from the scottish highlands in the wake of the defeat of the jacobites at the battle of culloden and the incipient beginnings of the highland clearances the two companies built trading posts far west of lake superior and hudson bay but the norwesters were more aggressive as they travelled north to the arctic ocean via the mackenzie river and west to the pacific the fierce competition ended in  with the amalgamation of the companies into a hudsons bay company monopoly the company finally surrendered its northwestern empire when it sold its land to canada in  following the decrease in profits and demand for furs innis rounds out the story by documenting the decline of the fur trade monopoly as silk hats and fancier fox fur displaced beaver the coming of steam boats to the west and the building of railways brought increasing competition from independent traders and new companies from the american west as well as firms from winnipeg edmonton and vancouver improved transportation also brought increased control of the trade and cheaper goods increased control led to more inspections better accounting conservative policies decreased aggression and expansion of districts problems that arose included the difficulty in monitoring large districts and policies that were sometimes too rigid the increase in agriculture also brought competition through decreased reliance on game for food innis ends by noting that in  the hudsons bay company announced it had invested in two fox farms in prince edward island making the outlook for the trade in wild fur increasingly uncertain the time would appear to have arrived innis writes for a competent survey of the problems of the trade looking to the conservation of one of canadas important natural resources indeed in the end there was an abundance of goods and a lack of furs suggesting the trade was no longer a major part of the economy furs culture and technologyedit inniss account of the fur trade as the history of contact between two civilizations the european and the north american focuses on the radical effects of new techniques and technologies the trade became important in the late th century when the beaver hat a new style of waterproof headgear became popular among welldressed european gentlemen innis stresses however that the trade was propelled by native peoples intense demand for european manufactured goods a beaver felt hat the importance of iron to a culture dependent on bone wood bark and stone can only be suggested the cumbersome method of cooking in wooden vessels with heated stones was displaced by portable kettles work could be carried out with greater effectiveness with iron axes and hatchets and sewing became much less difficult with awls than it had been with bone needles to the indians iron and iron manufactures were of prime importance the french were the gens du fer muskets knives and metal spears also made hunting easier and more efficient but innis points out that the convenience of european manufactured goods came at a high price the native peoples became dependent on european traders for fresh supplies ammunition and spare parts more efficient hunting with guns led to the extermination of the beaver and the need to push into new hunting territories in search of more furs this competition led to outbreaks of fighting wars between tribes which with bows and arrows had not been strenuous innis writes conducted with guns were disastrous everything was made worse because native peoples had no immunity to european diseases such as smallpox which continually ravaged their communities decimating whole populations finally european rum brandy and strong wine brought illness conflict and addiction again and again innis draws attention to what he sees as the disastrous and catastrophic effects of the contact between a more technologically advanced european civilization and traditional native societies he writes that the aboriginal peoples dependence on the trade in beaver pelts to secure european iron goods disturbed the balance which had grown up previous to the coming of the european decades later innis would return to this concept of balance in his communications writings just as aboriginal peoples depended on imported manufactured goods european traders relied for their survival on native tools and techniques birchbark canoes enabled traders to travel in spring summer and fall snowshoes and toboggans made winter travel possible while indian corn pemmican and wild game provided sustenance and clothing equally important innis notes was the natives thorough knowledge of woodland territories and the habits of the animals they hunted biographer john watson argues that in his study of the fur trade innis broke new ground by making cultural factors central to economic development in watsons terms the fur trade in canada is a complex analysis of three distinct cultural groups metropolitan european customers who bought expensive beaver hats colonial settlers who traded beaver fur for goods from their home countries and indigenous peoples who came to depend on european ironage technologies also innis notes the dependence of traders on first nations peoples and suggests their dominance in early trading when he writes the trade in furs was stimulated by french traders who rapidly acquired an intimate knowledge of the indians language customs and habits of life  the trader encouraged the best hunters exhorted the indians to hunt beaver and directed their fleets of canoes to the rendezvous alliances were formed and wars were favoured to increase the supply of fur goods were traded that would encourage the indian to hunt beaver innis writes that the french used christianity to make first nations more amenable to trade they encouraged war or promoted peace as ways of winning first nations support he notes these policies led to an increase in the overhead costs of trade that decreased profits and encouraged the growth of monopolies economic effects of

the effects of the staples trade on the more technologically advanced home countries of france and britain fundamentally the civilization of north america is the civilization of europe innis writes and the interest of this volume is primarily in the effects of a vast new land area on european civilization he notes that european settlers in north america survived by borrowing the cultural traits of the indigenous peoples but also sought to maintain european standards of living by exporting goods not available in the home country in exchange for manufactured products in canadas case the first such goods were the staples cod fish and beaver fur later staples included lumber pulp and paper wheat gold nickel and other metals innis maintains that this twoway trade had significant effects the colony put its energies into producing staples while the mother country manufactured finished products thus the staples trade promoted industrial development in europe while the colony remained tied to the production of raw materials as time passed colonial agriculture industry transportation trade finance and government activities tended to be subordinated to the production of staple commodities for industrial britain and later for the rapidly developing united states this cumulative dependence on staples relegated canadians to the status of hewers of wood and drawers of water the economic history of canada has been dominated by the discrepancy between the centre and margin of western civilization innis concludes for him as biographer donald creighton points out canadas economic axis

vulnerable both to disruptions in the sources of supply and to the whims of export markets in the case of beaver fur for example a slight change in fashion in sophisticated metropolitan centres like london and paris could have devastating effects in a marginal backwoods colony dependent on exporting staples innis developed the concept of cyclonics to explain the disruptions that occurred when new technologies led to the rapid exploitation and then exhaustion of staple commodities europeanmade guns for example increased the efficiency of beaver hunting but led to the animals rapid extermination forcing traders into costly longdistance searches for new sources of supply later the decline of the white pine a vital commodity in the lumber trade forced the shift to pulp and paper production

fur trade  wikipedia harold innis and the fur trade from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search main article harold innis harold adams innis november   – november   was a professor of political economy at the university of toronto and the author of seminal works on canadian economic history and on media and communication theory he helped develop the staples thesis which holds that canadas culture political history and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur fish wood wheat mined metals and fossil fuels harold inniss classic study the fur trade in canada  draws sweeping conclusions about the complex and frequently devastating effects of the fur trade on aboriginal peoples about how furs as staple products induced an enduring economic dependence among the european immigrants who settled in the new colony and about how the fur trade ultimately shaped canadas political destiny contents  the fur trade in canada  introduction  fur trade history  furs culture and technology  economic effects of staple products  canada as a marginal colony  concept of cyclonics  politics and the staples trade  assessment  notes the fur trade in canadaedit introductionedit harold innis begins the fur trade in canada with a brief chapter on the beaver which became a much desired fur due to the popularity of the beaver hat in european society he remarks that it is impossible to understand the developments of the fur trade or of canadian history without some knowledge of the beavers life and habits biographer john watson notes that innis was following an analytical approach he had learned during his postgraduate work at the university of chicago in such case studies innis had been taught it was necessary to understand the nature of a commodity or staple product and to adopt a comprehensive view of it by studying its geography since first nations cultures and ways of life are intrinsically tied to landscape it was their techniques of hunting and preparation coupled with geography that essentially determined the development of the fur trade  in the case of the beaver the techniques for creating the best quality of beaver pelt hats included the age of the animal and what time of year the beaver was killed thus innis notes that the most valuable beaver fur was to be found north of the st lawrence river especially in the deciduous forests of the precambrian shield with its abundance of waterways he suggests that beaver fur could be carried long distances because the pelt of the average adult weighed less than two pounds the animal itself was a good source of food innis points out that the beaver migrates very little and travels over land very slowly although beavers reproduce prolifically it takes them more than two years to mature these biological characteristics made their destruction in great numbers inevitable especially after indian hunters acquired european axes that could chop through beaver lodges and dams european guns knives and spears also made the sedentary beaver easy prey innis concludes his introduction by noting that as beaver populations were destroyed in eastern areas traders were forced to push north and west in search of new sources of supply the problem of the fur trade he writes became one of organizing the transport of supplies and furs over increasingly greater distances in this movement the waterways of the beaver areas were of primary importance and occupied a vital position in the economic development of northern north america fur trade historyedit the neutrality of this article is disputed relevant discussion may be found on the talk page please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met july  learn how and when to remove this template message harold innis meticulously traces the fur trade over more than four centuries from the early th century to the s it is a story filled with military conflict between french and english imperial forces and among warring indian tribes it is also a tale of shrewd barter and commercial rivalry yet innis the economic historian tells the story in  pages of dry eurocentric and dense prose packed with statistics ruperts land the territory controlled by the hudsons bay company under its royal charter of  the company eventually ruled an area stretching from labrador to the pacific innis begins by chronicling the first contacts between european fishing fleets and eastern native tribes in the early th century after the founding of the french settlement at quebec in  by samuel de champlain the colony known as new france depended on furs for its economic survival champlain joined forces with the huron confederacy and its tribal allies against the iroquois confederacy in the long struggle to control the fur trade as new france grew french colonists first known as coureurs de bois and later voyageurs travelled north and west from montreal in search of new supplies while their british rivals set up northern trading posts run by the hudsons bay company the commercial rivalry continued after the british conquest of new france in  with the establishment of the north west company by a group of bilingual scottish gaelicenglishspeaking montreal merchants who had come to british north america from the scottish highlands in the wake of the defeat of the jacobites at the battle of culloden and the incipient beginnings of the highland clearances the two companies built trading posts far west of lake superior and hudson bay but the norwesters were more aggressive as they travelled north to the arctic ocean via the mackenzie river and west to the pacific the fierce competition ended in  with the amalgamation of the companies into a hudsons bay company monopoly the company finally surrendered its northwestern empire when it sold its land to canada in  following the decrease in profits and demand for furs innis rounds out the story by documenting the decline of the fur trade monopoly as silk hats and fancier fox fur displaced beaver the coming of steam boats to the west and the building of railways brought increasing competition from independent traders and new companies from the american west as well as firms from winnipeg edmonton and vancouver improved transportation also brought increased control of the trade and cheaper goods increased control led to more inspections better accounting conservative policies decreased aggression and expansion of districts problems that arose included the difficulty in monitoring large districts and policies that were sometimes too rigid the increase in agriculture also brought competition through decreased reliance on game for food innis ends by noting that in  the hudsons bay company announced it had invested in two fox farms in prince edward island making the outlook for the trade in wild fur increasingly uncertain the time would appear to have arrived innis writes for a competent survey of the problems of the trade looking to the conservation of one of canadas important natural resources indeed in the end there was an abundance of goods and a lack of furs suggesting the trade was no longer a major part of the economy furs culture and technologyedit inniss account of the fur trade as the history of contact between two civilizations the european and the north american focuses on the radical effects of new techniques and technologies the trade became important in the late th century when the beaver hat a new style of waterproof headgear became popular among welldressed european gentlemen innis stresses however that the trade was propelled by native peoples intense demand for european manufactured goods a beaver felt hat the importance of iron to a culture dependent on bone wood bark and stone can only be suggested the cumbersome method of cooking in wooden vessels with heated stones was displaced by portable kettles work could be carried out with greater effectiveness with iron axes and hatchets and sewing became much less difficult with awls than it had been with bone needles to the indians iron and iron manufactures were of prime importance the french were the gens du fer muskets knives and metal spears also made hunting easier and more efficient but innis points out that the convenience of european manufactured goods came at a high price the native peoples became dependent on european traders for fresh supplies ammunition and spare parts more efficient hunting with guns led to the extermination of the beaver and the need to push into new hunting territories in search of more furs this competition led to outbreaks of fighting wars between tribes which with bows and arrows had not been strenuous innis writes conducted with guns were disastrous everything was made worse because native peoples had no immunity to european diseases such as smallpox which continually ravaged their communities decimating whole populations finally european rum brandy and strong wine brought illness conflict and addiction again and again innis draws attention to what he sees as the disastrous and catastrophic effects of the contact between a more technologically advanced european civilization and traditional native societies he writes that the aboriginal peoples dependence on the trade in beaver pelts to secure european iron goods disturbed the balance which had grown up previous to the coming of the european decades later innis would return to this concept of balance in his communications writings just as aboriginal peoples depended on imported manufactured goods european traders relied for their survival on native tools and techniques birchbark canoes enabled traders to travel in spring summer and fall snowshoes and toboggans made winter travel possible while indian corn pemmican and wild game provided sustenance and clothing equally important innis notes was the natives thorough knowledge of woodland territories and the habits of the animals they hunted biographer john watson argues that in his study of the fur trade innis broke new ground by making cultural factors central to economic development in watsons terms the fur trade in canada is a complex analysis of three distinct cultural groups metropolitan european customers who bought expensive beaver hats colonial settlers who traded beaver fur for goods from their home countries and indigenous peoples who came to depend on european ironage technologies also innis notes the dependence of traders on first nations peoples and suggests their dominance in early trading when he writes the trade in furs was stimulated by french traders who rapidly acquired an intimate knowledge of the indians language customs and habits of life  the trader encouraged the best hunters exhorted the indians to hunt beaver and directed their fleets of canoes to the rendezvous alliances were formed and wars were favoured to increase the supply of fur goods were traded that would encourage the indian to hunt beaver innis writes that the french used christianity to make first nations more amenable to trade they encouraged war or promoted peace as ways of winning first nations support he notes these policies led to an increase in the overhead costs of trade that decreased profits and encouraged the growth of monopolies economic effects of staple productsedit canada as a marginal colonyedit inniss page conclusion to the fur trade in canada explains the significance of staple products such as furs to colonial development it also explores the effects of the staples trade on the more technologically advanced home countries of france and britain fundamentally the civilization of north america is the civilization of europe innis writes and the interest of this volume is primarily in the effects of a vast new land area on european civilization he notes that european settlers in north america survived by borrowing the cultural traits of the indigenous peoples but also sought to maintain european standards of living by exporting goods not available in the home country in exchange for manufactured products in canadas case the first such goods were the staples cod fish and beaver fur later staples included lumber pulp and paper wheat gold nickel and other metals innis maintains that this twoway trade had significant effects the colony put its energies into producing staples while the mother country manufactured finished products thus the staples trade promoted industrial development in europe while the colony remained tied to the production of raw materials as time passed colonial agriculture industry transportation trade finance and government activities tended to be subordinated to the production of staple commodities for industrial britain and later for the rapidly developing united states this cumulative dependence on staples relegated canadians to the status of hewers of wood and drawers of water the economic history of canada has been dominated by the discrepancy between the centre and margin of western civilization innis concludes for him as biographer donald creighton points out canadas economic axis began as a great competitive eastwest trading system founded on the st lawrence river and the great lakes one end of which lay in the metropolitan centres of western europe and the other in the hinterland of north america it was a transoceanic as well as a transcontinental system concept of cyclonicsedit innis argued that a country dependent on the export of staple products would always be vulnerable both to disruptions in the sources of supply and to the whims of export markets in the case of beaver fur for example a slight change in fashion in sophisticated metropolitan centres like london and paris could have devastating effects in a marginal backwoods colony dependent on exporting staples innis developed the concept of cyclonics to explain the disruptions that occurred when new technologies led to the rapid exploitation and then exhaustion of staple commodities europeanmade guns for example increased the efficiency of beaver hunting but led to the animals rapid extermination forcing traders into costly longdistance searches for new sources of supply later the decline of the white pine a vital commodity in the lumber trade forced the shift to pulp and paper production based on abundant spruce shifts from one staple to another led to constant economic cyclones canadians have exhausted their energies innis wrote in  in opening up the west in developing mines hydroelectric power and pulp and paper mills of the canadian shield in building transcontinental railways grain elevators and cities harold innis argues that the need to pay for costly railways led to canadian confederation in  for innis imported industrial techniques led to rapid resource exploitation overproduction waste depletion and economic collapse these were the problems of economically marginal staplesproducing countries like canada politics and the staples tradeedit innis famously writes that canada emerged not in spite of geography but because of it the countrys boundaries roughly coincide he argues with the furtrading areas of northern north america certainly the increased demand for furs such as beaver resulted in increased exploration westward innis maintains that the shift from furs to lumber led to european immigration and the rapid settling of the west the coffin ships that carried the lumber to europe brought back emigrants as a return cargo the export of lumber and later wheat required improvements in transportation  the construction of canals and the building of railways the costs of these transportation improvements were largely responsible he writes for the act of union joining upper and lower canada in  and the political confederation of ontario quebec new brunswick and nova scotia in  economic reliance on staples production in a vast country led to the development of centralized banking a strong federal government and the combination of government ownership and private enterprise which has been a further characteristic of canadian development through the encouragement of the monopoly of the hudsons bay company is born centralized control use of military aggression and hints of nationalism  innis concludes that the maintenance of ties with france and britain encouraged a diversity of institutions and greater tolerance adding that canada has remained fundamentally a product of europe assessmentedit historian carl berger notes that it took  years to sell the first thousand copies of the fur trade in canada yet he writes the book is one of the few in canadian historical literature that deserves to be described as seminal according to berger innis showed that canada was far from a fragile political creation and that its existence represented the triumph of human will and determination he replaced this old and familiar truism with the idea that river systems and the canadian shield imposed a geographic unity and that confederation was in a sense a political reflection of the natural coherence of northern america berger adds that in exploring the links between economic changes and political developments inniss insights pointed to a general reinterpretation of canadian history innis also placed indian culture at the centre of his study of the fur trade and was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of native society under the thrust of european capitalism unlike other historians innis emphasized the contributions of first nations peoples we have not yet realized he writes that the indian and his culture were fundamental to the growth of canadian institutions berger refers to the sense of fatalism and determinism in inniss economic history adding that for innis material realities determined history not language religion or social beliefs his history as history was dehumanized berger adds biographer john watson argues however that the fur trade in canada is more complex more universal and less rigidly deterministic than commonly accepted watson points for example to inniss central concern with the role of culture in economic history and his awareness of cultural disintegration under the impact of advanced technologies innis never uses the staple as anything more than a focusing
