follow their ancestors lead proclaim the authors of this update to their bestselling original for hundreds of thousands of years the human diet consisted of unrefined foods that were high in fiber low in sugar and low on the glycemic index eating similarly nowavoiding white flour white potatoes white rice sugar soft drinks and highly processed foods in general the basic principles of a diet thats been fieldtested by the human digestive system throughout the eonswill help people lose weight and keep it off the authors argue their reasoning is sound high blood sugar triggers the release of insulin the fatstorage hormone and the ceo of metabolism the less the body lives in fat storage mode the better and the lifestyle they propose is simple though it goes beyond just chucking the lb bag of domino into the trash try eating six small meals a day dont eat after  pm read the labels of all breads and cereals to find the hidden sugars and stock your refrigerator with vegetables and lean meats the authors say in chapters that are straightforward and focused the authors consider childhood obesity and diabetes discuss artificial sweeteners and alcohol offer recipes from restaurants

control weight lossrecipes read an excerpt introductionsince sugar busters cut sugar to trim fat was first published in  confirmations of the suc cess and wisdom of this way of eating have continued to be documented in clinical studies testimonials and the nutritional literature large numbers of doctors all over the country are not only following the sugar busters lifestyle but recommending it to their patients medical studies are proving that highfiber lowglycemic diets like the sugar busters lifestyle recommends are good for weight control and control of many medical maladies the lowsugar lowglycemic highfiber diet helps or in some cases even prevents problems such as obesity diabetes cardiovascular diseases and many others that will be discussed later in this bookyou may have heard the statistic that obesity has risen as much in the last ten years as in the previous four decades combined while we cannot prove or disprove these statistics we do know that obesity is rising so rapidly that it is about to replace smoking as the numberone killer in the united states ten years ago smoking killed  people a year and obesity killed  a year smokingrelated death rates are going down but obesityrelated rates are still climbingfortunately both smoking and becoming obese are lifestyle choices all smokers can quit and over  percent of obese or overweight individuals can better control their weight with just two steps finding a safe and easy way to accomplish that goal and giving it a shot pounds cannot be “thought” off we will tell you how to lose weight and just as important how to keep it off unlike so many diets that put you through a crash phase or deprivation phase and then an adjusted phase the sugar busters lifestyle gets you to “start out like you can hold out” yes that you can maintain for the rest of your life since you will not be deprived of normal amounts of foods this will be much easier than you might imaginewhat is the secret that makes the sugar busters lifestyle so simple easy effective and inexpen sive let us boil all this down to its essence in one sentence we are recommending that you eat like your ancestors ate until very recently because they ate zero refined sugar and only wholegrain and unrefined foods that is what god and mother nature provided that is the eating plan that got us here it was a highfiber lowglycemicload diet that contained no refined sugar see chapter  a little honey was available for the chiefs or royalty or for those who braved the bees but not for the general population of the time sugar and the sweet tastes of the day came from natural fruits and vegetableswhat do anthropologists tell us about these ancestors of ours they tell us that obesity diabetes and heart disease appear to have been quite rareremember that the numbertwo killer soon to be number one at the dawn of the twentyfirst century is obesity what two diseases are strongly associated with obesity you are right diabetes and heart disease to further get you in the mood to absorb the way of eating recommended in this book think about the following dr thomas farley chair of the department of community health sciences at tulane university’s school of public health and tropical medicine recently wrote that in the forty years between  and  the number of americans diagnosed with diabetes rose  percent of course more people are being screened for diabetes today but the increase in diabetes is still tremendous according to the government diabetes alone is costing the united states over  billion a year that is hundreds of dollars apiece for the average taxpayer to treat something that as you will see is largely preventablein addition to diabetes obesity can cause you who are obese and your children the following problems heart disease high blood pressure stroke kidney failure cancer colon breast and prostate gallstones poor circulation amputations arthritis pregnancy complications menstrual irregularities stress incontinence and depression diabetes can also lead to blindnessthirty years ago following the  olympics the country went on a fitness kick and a larger percent of the population started exercising this lasted about a decade in that same decade we were advised to shift to a lowfat highcarbohydrate diet we did and the rate of obesity increased even more as we will discuss later when it comes to refined and processed foods low fat is usually synonymous with high sugar during the succeeding decades according to government statistics the consumption of fat has dropped about  percent while the consumption of calories has remained about the same meanwhile obesity has continued to climb according to the national center for health statistics sixtyfive percent of americans are overweight and  percent of us are obese obesity not just overweight is now claiming  percent of our childrenwhat have been the most dramatic diet and lifestyle changes in the last thirty to fifty years• tremendous rise in refined sugar consumption• tremendous rise in lowfat foods with in most cases fats being replaced with added sugars• tremendous rise in carbohydrate intake as dietary fat and protein were cut• significant decrease in physical activity• tremendous rise in obesity and related illnesses• tremendous rise in diabetes and related illnesses• tremendous rise in individual dollars spent on pills potions and treatments• an insignificant amount of dollars being spent on preventionhello anybody out there we are astonished that the government and many nutrition professionals continue to recommend highcarbohydrate lowfat diets as you read this book see if you don’t believe the sugar busters lifestyle will cure many of these problems without pills or potions and their associated expensesby the way we do not consider sugar busters a lowcarbohydrate lifestyle it is simply a correct carbohydrate lifestyle in our earlier fourteenday meal plan  percent of calories came from carbohydrate and we have told people that they can probably maintain or even lose weight if they get up to  percent of calories from the lowglycemicindex carbohydrates according to the chairman of the department of epidemiology at m d ander son hospital the number one rated cancer research hospital in the united states the highfiber lowglycemicindex carbohydrates like we recommend in our sugar busters books are those that are high in antioxidants and are exactly what m d anderson recommends that their patients should eatsince the sugar busters way of eating is roughly  percent carbohydrates  percent protein and  percent fat it is a balanced diet according to the us department of agriculture a moderatefat diet is most likely to be nutritionally adequate because it allows a healthy mix of foods from all food groups this provides a balance that does not require supplements sound familiarbesides knowing that our digestive systems developed on a highfiber lowglycemic diet over the millennia what makes the sugar busters lifestyle tick controlling which in this case means lowering our body’s insulin requirement is the key to having our body lean and healthytoday’s sugary highly processed foods cause a rapid rise in blood sugar which immediately create a big demand for the hormone insulin insulin is required to regulate the blood sugar level in your body it does this by signaling the cells to be receptive to the storage of fats circulating in the blood almost any doctor in america will tell you that insulin is known as the “fat storage hormone” accordingly if you consume foods that do not create this big need for insulin you don’t put the body in a fat storage mode neither do you subject the body to other problems caused by too much circulating insulin as will be described further in chapter if you enjoy eating this is a goodnews book if you choose to eat out frequently or if your employment requires it this is a goodnews book if you want your blood chemistry to improve while you continue to eat savory foods this is a goodnews book if you are diabetic this is a goodnews book if you want your children to grow up slim and healthy this is a goodnews book in addition to all these benefits you will feel and function better in the process we propose a way of eating that will allow you to eat most foods in normal quantities—possibly even in larger quantities than you presently consumeyou can have three full meals a day and even appropriate snacks if you want to eat six small meals or snacks that’s fine too there will be only a few fruits and vegetables plus products containing added sugars and highly processed grains flours that you cannot eat these are the foods that require the secretion of large amounts of insulin to regulate your blood sugar by simply avoiding these foods you can get slimmer and healthier simultaneouslythere are other books that recommend a much lower percentage of carbohydrate in one’s diet many miss one of the most important factors in successful longterm weight loss which is that only certain carbohydrates cause a dramatic increase in your body’s need for insulin eliminating most carbohydrates in the diet means missing out on many of the very important vitamins minerals antioxidants and other nutrients that our bodies need to function properlyis sugar toxic not inherently but we say that refined sugar in large quanities is certainly toxic to many human bodies particularly diabetics an it helps make many people obese significant quantites of sugar are also derived in our digestive systems from carbohydrates in general fruits vegetables and grains but only certain of these sugars cause a strain on the health of our body probably the mind and certainly the waistline fructose the sugar in fruit normally will not hurt you but eaten at the wrong time or in the wrong combinations it can create digestive and sometimes metabolic problems therefore what we are recommending is a lowsugar lowglycemic diet that cannot be achieved by simply putting away your sugar canisterthe essence of the sugar busters lifestyle which will be covered much more thoroughly in succeeding chapters is that the only things you cannot eat on this diet are the carbohydrates that cause an intense insulin secretion you must virtually eliminate white potatoes white rice bread from highly refined flour corn products beets and of course all refined sugars such as sucrose table sugar corn syrup molasses and honey also sugared soft drinks and beer are not allowed beyond that the list of foods allowed on the sugar busters lifestyle is extensive and will delight you by its length and varietyremember that all carbohydrates are broken down to glucose sugar in our body and this raises our blood sugar level insulin is then secreted by the pancreas to lower our blood sugar but too much insulin promotes the storage of fat elevation of cholesterol levels and possibly the deposition of plaque in our coronary arteries insulin also inhibits the breakdown of previously stored fat not fancy but fact the charts in figure  page zzz from williams textbook of endocrinology speak to this in a beautifully simple fashionby the way some people are insulin resistant and require large quantities of insulin to regulate their blood sugar level we have found nothing good about high average levels of insulin in the body insulin not only causes the body to store excess sugar as fat but inhibits the mobilization of previously stored fat even if one is on a rather skimpy but highglucosegenerating diet insulin also can stimu late the liver to make more cholesterolnow you might accept the connection between insulin and overweight but wonder about the link between insulin and cholesterol consider the experience of one of this book’s authorsafter beginning to eat steak lamb chops cheese eggs and so on for the first time in fifteen years and seeing his cholesterol drop  percent and triglycerides drop by  percent he told his doctor and coauthor that the only thing that seemed to make sense was that insulin must be causing the liver to make additional cholesterol because the main difference his lowsugar lowglycemic diet was causing was a lower daily average level of insulin circulating in his body our doctor paused about three seconds and said “you know you are right when borderline diabetics get to where they cannot control their diabetes with pills diet and exercise and we have to give them insulin injections we know the first major side effect will be that their cholesterol will become elevated and as the insulin shots continue the type  diabetics also will start adding more fatty tissue”our doctor immediately recognized a frequently overlooked connection between insulin and cholesterol in addition our endocrinologist and coauthor verified that his type  diabetic patients that require insulin have significantly higher total cholesterol and triglycerides than the average populationalthough we are in the twentyfirst century few appreciate the insulincholesterol connection fortunately more and more are recognizing the link every day many of our friends or patients who have gone on our lowglycemic lowsugar lifestyle have written to us that they had lowered their cholesterol by an average of  percent without either exercise or pills how could they have increased their fat intake and seen their cholesterol triglyceride and weight levels fall it is the effect of lower average levels of insulin in their bloodsound too simple well it really is simple but it’s important to understand why the sugar busters lifestyle works once you do you will be confident it is not another gimmicky diet which means you will be more likely to follow its guidelines and enjoy the maximum benefits so please don’t just jump to chapter  start the diet and then not be able to tell anybody why you lost the weight and how you got that spring back in your step learn how it works and you’ll better understand the benefits and enjoyment it can bring you for life—most probably a longer and healthier lifecalories are not the only answer to weight gain or loss lavoisier first used the term calorie in the s subsequently in the th century a caloric theory developed that explained weight gain or loss although this theory was later declared flawed by the authors nutritionist ignored this correctionwe have been misled for decades by peddlers of the calorieincalorieout theory who either did not know better or had other obvious motives the scientific data have been available in america for years waiting for a logical researcher to come to this same conclusion americans alone spend  billion a year trying to lose weight an additional  billion on medical costs directly related to problems caused by obesity and  billion on time lost while away from the workplace because of the same problems scientific ameri can aug  unfortunately for some this is an incentive to ignore a way of eating that creates no profits so get ready—you have a lot of mis information misconceptions and propaganda to overcomewhat motivates three doctors to tell you about something that will cost you only a few additional dollars each year on your grocery bill and save you the expense and time of going so often to the doctor’s office the effects of a lowglycemic diet will actually take patients away from many doctors but doctors are in the business of saving lives the message in this book can prolong lives and significantly improve the quality of lifewhat’s wrong with losing weight in other ways some diets are in essence partial starvation depleting the body of essential proteins vitamins and minerals and making you miserable by depriving you of normal quantities of food of course a whole industry is built on providing at a price vitamins and supplements in any quantity you might conceivably want but did you ever taste a pill you really liked instead of having to swallow a pill why not eat a plateful of savory fruits vegetables and meats and lose weight in the processwhat a waste of money to spend billions of dollars a year trying to lose weight we’ll show you how to replace the most notorious insulinstimulating carbohydrates with wholesome foods that you can buy at nearly any grocery store watch out at the grocery store however—manufacturers have added some form of refined sugar to most packaged products even foods like chili because they know that if it does not have a sweet flavor it may not compete well with other brandswe have harped on insulin’s bad effects but we will now describe the benefits of another of the body’s secretions glucagon also shown on figure  page zzz is released from the pancreas into the bloodstream in significant quantities following the consumption of a proteinrich meal glucagon helps promote the mobilization of previously stored fat so as you burn food reserves for your energy requirements between meals high level of glucagons will help allow that energy to be derived from that spare tire around your waist the glucagon chart also shows that once the glucagon levels is raised it will remain elevated for quite some time so you can keep on burning that mobilized fatremember insulin inhibits the mobilization of previously stored fat because a highprotein meal does not stimulate significant amounts of insu lin secretion the fat mobilization inhibitor is not present but a high level of glucagon the fat mobilizer is presentthe chart also shows that carbohydraterich meals actually suppress glucagon secretion so the storedfat mobilizer is absent but the hormone to promote storage insulin is present in significant amounts when fat gets stored we all know where it goesready for more good news following the pattern of eating we recommend can greatly relieve many common stomach maladies one of this book’s authors went from rolaids or alkaseltzer twice a week to none after beginning to eat steak lamb chops cheese and eggs for the first time in fifteen years the only other alteration beyond a lowsugar lowglycemicload diet that he made was the substitution of red wine for other alcoholic beverages he used to consumeto drink or not to drink you can find arguments both ways but we believe as do most american doctors that if you consume modest amounts of alcoholic beverages it will help raise your hdl or “good” cholesterol and that the alcoholic beverage that benefits you most is red wine populations in countries with a higher relative consumption of red wine to other spirits definitely experience a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease researchers believe it is primarily the polyphenols including flavonoids in red wine that provide the cardiovascular benefits see chapter one thing is for certain alcohol itself has calories so consuming it does not help you lose weight however with reasonably comfortable adjustments in eating habits significant quantities of weight can be lost even if you continue to drink modest amounts of alcohol such as red winehow about exercise exercise is a definite plus in overall body fitness and health especially if done regularly and in moderate amounts see chapter  nevertheless a moderate amount of exercise will not significantly affect weight loss if you continue to eat foods that create a constant need for high levels of insulin in your bloodstreamone of this book’s authors lost twenty pounds and has kept it off for almost ten years he’s not proud that he does not take the time to exercise but the fact is that he doesn’t so the twentypound weight loss did not come from exercise or a lowcalorie diet it came from a lowglycemic lowsugar highfiber diet he is not necessarily an example we want you to imitate—we definitely believe exercise is good for you in combination with the lifestyle we recommend it should help achieve a general improvement in body weight control and overall healthone word of caution if you are a marathon runner or an exercise fanatic this diet may not be exactly right for you high levels of exercise require foods that generate large quantities of glucose to fuel your engine but research is showing that it is the lowglycemicindex carbs that provide the best endurance capacitydoes every person’s body react to and process metabolize foods in exactly the same way no but understanding the messages in this book will help you understand not only why these differences exist but also what you can do to positively influence your own body’s reaction to various foods and combinations of foodssome women have found it more difficult than men to lose weight on any diet this can be explained in part by the fact that a female’s metabolic rate on an ageadjusted basis is usually  to  percent lower than that of a male this makes it easier to put on weight and more difficult to lose weight hormonal influences present in both premeno pausal and postmenopausal women also may be responsible for difficulties in losing weight hormone therapy in the form of either birth control pills or estrogen and synthetic progesterone supplements may further aggravate this problem chapter  addresses in more detail the problems some women have experienced with weight loss because of hormonal intakealso please be aware that even some of the most common overthecounter preparations can cause fluid retention increased appetite and other changes that can lead to weight gain however all individuals especially women should be cautions about taking or discontinuing any type of medication without prior consultation with their physicianshow about “fat burner” supplements that are supposed to boost your metabolism even in the absence of exercise according to the tufts university health and nutrition letter of may  almost all contain ephedra which can increase your metabolism but can also cause irregular heartbeat high blood pressure chest pain and even stroke heart attack seizures and death ephedra is marketed as a dietary supplement rather than a drug and supplements are not regulated unlike prescription drugs so buyer bewarefrom the
