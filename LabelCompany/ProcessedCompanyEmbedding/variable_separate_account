variable life insurance policy is a form of permanent life insurance variable life insurance provides permanent protection to the beneficiary upon the death of the policyholder this type of insurance is generally more expensive than term insurance because it allows the insured to allocate a portion of the premium dollars to a separate account comprised of various instruments and investment funds within the insurance companys portfolio such as stocks bonds equity funds money market funds and bond funds next up universal life insurance life insurance adjustable life insurance whole life insurance policy breaking down variable life insurance policy because of investment risks variable policies are considered securities contracts and are regulated under the federal securities laws therefore they must be sold via a prospectus as a securities product fund performance may lead to declining cash value or death benefit over timevariable life insurance policies have certain tax benefits made available to policyholders such as the ability to utilize cash value on a taxbenefited basis as long as premiums are paid and the policy remains in force policyholders can access the cash value through a taxfree loan against the policy should cash value be withdrawn instead of borrowed the policyholder faces tax implications on any realized earnings any loans taken out that are not repaid have the potential to decrease the death benefit paid to beneficiaries at the time the insured passes awayvariable life insurance flexibilityone of the aspects of variable life insurance that makes it stand out among other permanent life insurance policies is the flexibility it provides policyholders in terms of premiums paid and cash value accumulation premiums paid to a variable life insurance policy are not fixed as they are with traditional whole life insurance or term insurance instead they can be shifted up or down over time within certain limits based on the insureds needs for example an insured with a variable life insurance policy may decide to reduce monthly premium payments from  to  because a major expense may have impeded cash flow for a period of time the cash value within the policy can be used to make up the shortage in premium payments during the time lower premium payments are made when cash flow returns to a comfortable level the insured has the option to increase premiums back to the initial  per monthdownsides of variable life insuranceunlike fixed life insurance products variable life insurance may require policyholders to add premiums over time to ensure the death benefit remains guaranteed to a certain age paying more than the minimum cost of insurance for a variable life insurance policy is one method to ensure guarantees remain intact additionally investment risks within the cash value of a variable life insurance policy fall completely on the policyholder not the insurance company as such there are no guarantees as to how well the cash value may perform over time making it difficult to plan for using accumulated earnings in the future like most life insurance policies individuals are required to undergo full medical underwriting to obtain a variable life insurance policy related terms universal life insurance a type of flexible permanent life insurance offering the lowcost  life insurance a protection against the

federal securities laws for investmentlinked variable annuities although it took many years the application of separate accounts has dramatically expanded beyond this simple product design product development has resulted with an array of “hybrid” products—products that overlay traditional insurance company guarantees eg mortality morbidity etc being allocated to the separate account investment portfolio the use of separate accounts by insurers has evolved rapidly over the past  years in response to recommendations to clarify information pertaining to separate account products and related separate account assets detailed information is available in the statutory financial statements distinct filings for separate products that are “insulated” or “not insulated” from the general account creditors when completing the insulated separate account filing the reporting entity is only to include those assets that are legally insulated by state law or statute in which the state law provides

contributions into various subaccounts of a separate account based upon the risk appetite of the annuitant the contributions can be invested in stocks bonds or other investments income payments in the annuitization phase can be fixed or fluctuate with the investment performance of the underlying subaccounts of the separate account in contrast to fixed annuities policyholders assume all of the investment risk with variable annuities because they are separate account products that are valued at market every day additionally variable annuities are registered as securities with the securities and exchange commission sec overview insurers began marketing variable deferred annuities in the late s in response to rising interest rates and equity markets unlike the fixed deferred annuities insurers mostly sold up until this time variable annuities offered investors the ability to hedge against this rising inflation because variable annuities are backed by assets held in an insurers separate accounts their income benefits fluctuate with the investment performance of the underlying separate account investments originally variable annuities underlying investment funds primarily consisted of corporate common stock but as time went on insurers expanded their fund offerings to include bonds indices mutual funds and other securities this enabled policyholders to move funds between various subaccounts to achieve a certain investment strategy to boost sales insurers began offering variable annuity products with guarantees about a decade ago since then there have been a plethora of guarantees introduced to the market with most insurers now offering various minimum guarantees these guarantees can ensure the policyholder receives minimum death benefits guaranteed living benefits accumulation benefits minimum credited interest rates and income benefit or withdrawal benefit amounts variable annuities with guarantees provide an important differentiation to other alternative investments such as mutual funds which is their biggest competitor sales of both group and individual variable annuities rose in the s demand for annuities in general increased significantly after the tax reform act of  reduced the tax advantages of qualified retirement plans individual variable annuities became particularly popular a cipr study on the state of the life insurance industry notes that by the mids growth in individual annuities had resulted in insurers overall product mix becoming almost evenly distributed between annuity considerations and traditional insurance products by the end of the century annuity products led by variable annuity sales had become so popular their sales volumes outpaced those of traditional life insurance the result would be an historic shift in life insurers overall product mix toward annuities however low interest rates and equity market volatility of the past decade have placed pressure on the returns for variable annuity products it has also hurt insurers ability to support variable annuities many of which were issued with minimum guarantees insurers have responded by reducing their guarantees and crediting rates to accommodate the new environment despite these economic pressures variable annuities continue to be in demand particularly as aging consumers seek savings vehicles designed to help them manage their longterm needs as such sales of variable annuities will remain an important source of revenue for insurers in the future status state insurance regulators monitor the solvency of insurance companies offering annuities and have strict rules in place some of which are derived from naic model laws and regulations the naic encourages states to adopt model laws and regulations designed to inform and protect annuity consumers the naic annuity disclosure model regulation establishes standards for the disclosure of certain information about annuity contracts to protect consumers and

background variable life insurance variable life insurance is similar to traditional life insurance except that the cash value andor death benefit vary based on the investment performance of the assets in which the premium payments are invested under a traditional life insurance policy premium payments are allocated to an insurers general account and invested consistent with state law requirements to enable the insurer to meet its death benefit and cash value guarantees the investment return on assets in the general account has little or no direct effect on the cash value or the death benefit received premium payments under a variable life policy in contrast are invested in an insurance company separate account which generally is not subject to state law investment restrictions a variable life policyholder typically is offered a variety of investment options eg equity bond and money market mutual funds death benefits and cash values are directly related to performance of the separate account although typically there is a guaranteed minimum death benefit variable life insurance was introduced in the early s during the years from the end of world war ii to the late s there was a significant decline in the share of savings dollars invested with life insurance companies in an effort to counteract this trend insurers began to offer a greater variety of products including equitybased products such as variable life insurance in recent years variable life insurance has become an increasingly important segment of the insurance industry by  variable life insurance accounted for  of first year individual life insurance premiums and  of total individual life insurance premiums since the early s assets in variable life products have grown substantially from  billion in december  to  billion in november  current forms for variable life insurance registration a separate account funding a variable life insurance policy most commonly is registered as a unit investment trust under the investment company act separate accounts registered as unit investment trusts are divided into subaccounts each of which invests in a different openend management investment company or mutual fund portfolio company both separate account unit investment trusts and the portfolio companies in which they invest are registered as investment companies under the investment company act and their securities are registered under the securities act investors in variable life insurance policies receive the prospectuses for both the separate account unit investment trust and the portfolio companies portfolio companies as mutual funds use form na to register under the investment company act and to register their shares under the securities act variable life separate accounts as unit investment trusts register under the investment company act on form nb and register their securities under the securities act on form s forms nb and s were designed for nonseparate account unit investment trusts and were adopted before the establishment of the first separate account to fund variable life insurance policies while much of their required disclosure is useful the forms request some information that is not typically of consequence to a buyer of variable life insurance more importantly many matters that would be significant to a buyer of a variable life insurance policy are not addressed at all by the forms another shortcoming of forms nb and s is that they do not reflect fundamental improvements that we have made to other investment company registration forms such as form n for variable annuities and form na for mutual funds which facilitate clearer and more concise disclosure to investors as a result variable life insurance prospectuses have often been unnecessarily lengthy and complex form n to address these shortcomings the commission issued a release proposing form n for public comment proposing release unlike the current forms proposed form n was specifically tailored to variable life insurance the proposed requirements of the form focused on information that is essential to a decision to invest in a particular variable life insurance policy and the form was intended to enhance the comparability of information about variable life insurance policies the proposal sought to promote more effective communication of information about variable life insurance policies all commenters expressed strong support for proposed form n commenters stated that proposed form n would improve the disclosure that investors receive about variable life insurance commenters indicated that proposed form n would require disclosure of essential information in the prospectus in a concise and userfriendly format and thus would facilitate decision making by investors commenters also recommended changes to proposed form n to improve disclosure we are adopting proposed form n substantially as proposed with modifications that reflect our consideration of commenters suggestions form n will promote effective disclosure to variable life insurance investors providing the following benefits tailored registration form form n will eliminate requirements in the current registration forms that are not relevant to variable life insurance form n also will include items that are specifically addressed to variable life insurance products such as descriptions of contractual provisions relating to premiums death benefits cash values surrenders and withdrawals and loans plain english the commissions plain english rule will apply to the front and back cover pages and the riskbenefit summary in the variable life insurance prospectus this should result in better clearer disclosure to investors reducing complex and lengthy prospectus disclosure form n will streamline variable life prospectus disclosure by adopting a twopart format consisting of a simplified prospectus designed to contain essential information that assists an investor in making an investment decision and a statement of additional information sai containing more extensive information and detailed discussion of matters included in the prospectus that investors could obtain upon request standardized fee information form n will require variable life insurance registrants to provide a uniform tabular presentation of fees and charges in order to improve the disclosure to investors of the often complex charges associated with variable life insurance policies and increase the comparability of charges among policies integrated disclosure document form n will provide variable life insurance registrants with an integrated form for investment company act and securities act registration eliminating unnecessary paperwork and duplicative reporting the adoption of form n is the latest commission action reflecting our longstanding commitment to improve the quality of disclosure available to investment company investors during the s the commission introduced the innovative twopart disclosure format for mutual funds and variable annuities and adopted uniform fee tables for mutual funds and variable annuities we have taken significant steps in the past few years including the comprehensive revision of form na the mutual fund disclosure form to provide a standardized riskreturn summary at the beginning of every mutual fund prospectus require mutual funds to prepare disclosure documents using plain english and eliminate prospectus clutter that obscures information that is helpful to investors making an investment decision last year we adopted amendments to our rules and forms to improve the disclosure that mutual funds provide about their independent directors and to require mutual funds to disclose aftertax returns form n is designed to promote more effective communication of information about variable life insurance policies todays adoption of form n represents a significant step toward our goal of better clearer more concise disclosure for all investors ii discussion we discuss below the significant comments that we received on proposed form n and the items that we have modified in response to comments a part a  information in the prospectus  riskbenefit summary benefits and risks item  we are adopting with modifications the requirement that a riskbenefit summary be included at the beginning of every prospectus the riskbenefit summary will provide key information about a policy including its risks and benefits and is intended to respond to investors strong preference for summary information in a standardized format it is designed to assist investors in evaluating and comparing variable life insurance policies by providing them with key information about a policy in a standardized easily accessible place commenters generally supported inclusion of the riskbenefit summary in the prospectus with suggested modifications several of which we are adopting today as proposed the riskbenefit summary would have been required to contain specified information in a required order and would not have been permitted to contain additional information some commenters expressed the view that providing registrants greater flexibility in describing policy features would result in more useful and understandable disclosure we agree and have modified the proposed requirement to permit the inclusion of additional information and to eliminate the ordering requirements of item  as adopted item  requires a concise plain english description of the policy including the benefits and principal risks we have eliminated the proposed requirement to disclose that part of the policy premium is allocated to insurance coverage part of the premium is invested and part of the premium is used to pay sales loads and other charges commenters noted that this disclosure may be inaccurate in some cases eg charges may be deducted from cash value rather than premium payments we agree in addition we believe that this disclosure is unnecessary because the investment and cost aspects of the policy are adequately covered elsewhere in the prospectus one commenter recommended that registrants be required to discuss the risk of replacing one policy with another which may include substantial deferred sales charges on the surrendered policy an additional medical examination and higher insurance charges item  as proposed and adopted requires disclosure that variable life insurance policies are unsuitable as shortterm savings vehicles and we would expect this disclosure to include a discussion of the adverse consequences of early surrender such as the payment of deferred sales charges we have however determined not to require a separate discussion of replacement risks because the risks of a replacement transaction including the risk that a replacement may be unsuitable are not risks of a particular policy and we believe that the prospectus should focus on the policy itself we are concerned however that replacement transactions associated with variable life insurance policies may not in all cases be in the best interests of investors these transactions create a potential for sales practice abuses through which contract owners may be induced to make disadvantageous exchanges that result in the payment of additional sales charges and broker compensation we note that replacement transactions involving variable insurance products have been the object of increasing regulatory scrutiny in recent years we remind brokerdealers of their obligation to recommend replacement transactions only when they are suitable we also urge life insurance companies to monitor replacement activity with respect to their policies on an ongoing basis proposed form n contemplated that risks associated with portfolio companies would be addressed in the portfolio companies prospectuses not the variable life insurance prospectus policies frequently offer numerous portfolio companies as investment options and the commission continues to believe that a variable life insurance prospectus may become too long and complex if it includes risk information specific to each portfolio company as a result investors are better served by consulting the portfolio company prospectus for risk information relating to the particular portfolio companies in which they are interested at the suggestion of commenters however we have modified item  to expressly permit the inclusion of information about the portfolio companies whether or not a registrant elects to include information about the portfolio companies item  will require a statement to the effect that a comprehensive discussion of the risks of each portfolio company may be found in the portfolio companys prospectus we have added an instruction to make it clear that if the riskbenefit summary includes information that responds to the requirements of other form items the information need not be repeated elsewhere in the prospectus this could for example permit a registrant that includes information about the portfolio companies in the riskbenefit summary to modify or omit discussion of the portfolio companies in the body of the prospectus as these modifications to proposed form n suggest we believe that it is appropriate to accord registrants broad flexibility to include a narrative summary that is most useful to their investors we are however concerned that this flexibility would permit a registrant to include excessively detailed information in the summary with the result that other important information that is not required by item  particularly the fee table required by item  would not be prominently located in the prospectus in order to provide registrants broad flexibility to design the narrative summary while ensuring that policy costs will receive the prominence they deserve we have modified proposed form n to require that the fee table must precede the information required by item  if the information provided in response to item  exceeds five pages in length  riskbenefit summary fee table item  fee table required we are adopting substantially as proposed the requirement that a variable life insurance prospectus include a fee table immediately following the summary of risks and benefits required by item  for the first time variable life insurance prospectuses will include a fee table similar to those long required for both mutual funds and variable annuities our goal is to promote to the greatest extent possible uniformity simplicity and comparability in fee disclosure commenters were divided in their views on the requirement to include a tabular presentation of fees and charges at the beginning of all variable life insurance policy prospectuses commenters that supported the fee table noted that it would facilitate comparisons among variable life insurance policies and bring variable life insurance fee disclosure into general parity with variable annuities and mutual funds commenters that objected to the requirement asserted that the proposed fee table would not provide useful disclosure for a prospective investor seeking to evaluate a variable life insurance policy or to compare several variable life insurance policies because of the complexity of variable life insurance fees and charges these commenters recommended alternatives that would permit issuers to provide disclosure of fees and charges in a format of their choosing which could include tabular presentations flow charts and narrative descriptions as outlined in the proposing release we agree with commenters that the fees and charges associated with variable life insurance policies often are quite complex for several reasons first the structure of fees often differs from one policy to another making comparisons among products difficult second fees typically are imposed at several levels within a variable life insurance policy making it difficult to assess the aggregate effect of charges for example management and other expenses may be deducted at the portfolio company level assetbased charges such as a mortality and expense risk charge may be deducted against separate account assets and other charges such as cost of insurance may be assessed against a policyholders individual cash value third some variable life charges particularly cost of insurance ie the charge imposed for death benefit coverage vary based upon the individual characteristics of the purchaser and change over the life of a policy the complexity of variable life insurance fees and charges makes it more difficult to prescribe a standardized disclosure format than for mutual funds or variable annuities we continue to believe however that the complexity of variable life insurance fees and charges makes it particularly important that investors receive clear understandable disclosure about this essential aspect of the investment decision as we noted in the proposing release the importance of this disclosure has been heightened since the passage of the national securities markets improvement act of  nsmia nsmia amended sections  and  of the investment company act to replace specific limits on the amount type and timing of charges that applied to variable insurance contracts with a requirement that aggregate charges be reasonable in relation to the services rendered the expenses expected to be incurred and the risks assumed by the insurance company the increased flexibility to structure variable life insurance charges given to insurers by nsmia increases the need for clear understandable disclosure of charges although we acknowledge the complexities associated with designing a fee table for variable life insurance we agree with those commenters who believe that it will facilitate comparison among variable life insurance policies as we noted in the proposing release in recent years the commission has observed that a number of variable life insurance registrants on their own initiative have added relatively simple tabular presentations of fees and charges to their prospectuses including fee tables that conform generally to the format we proposed the commission believes that these registrants efforts represent a significant step towards enhanced communication with investors about fees and charges and that it is appropriate at this time to extend these efforts to the industry as a whole by requiring variable life insurance prospectuses to include a fee table fee table format the fee table consists of three separate sections the first section shows policyholder transaction fees such as sales loads surrender charges and transfer fees the second section shows annual charges excluding annual portfolio company operating expenses the third section shows annual portfolio company operating expenses including management fees distribution fees and other expenses we are modifying the proposed fourcolumn format that would have required a registrant to identify each charge when the charge is deducted the amount of the charge and whether the charge is deducted from all policies or only certain policies commenters generally questioned the need for the fourth column identifying whether the charge is deducted from all policies or only certain policies we agree and the fee table as adopted does not include this column registrants that desire to indicate that a charge is not applicable to all policies may do so through footnotes to the fee table or some similar means we are also changing the format of the portfolio company operating expenses section of the fee table in response to commenters suggestions so that the presentation of portfolio company fees and expenses will more closely resemble the presentations required by forms na and n under proposed form n portfolio company operating expenses would have been disclosed in a format similar to that prescribed for charges assessed by an insurer under the terms of a variable life insurance policy we agree with a commenter who argued that the use of this format would tend to obscure the important differences between portfolio company charges and charges assessed under a variable life insurance policy such as the fact that portfolio company expenses are not contractual and may vary from year to year the commission believes that the format used for mutual fund expenses in forms na and n has provided uniformity simplicity and comparability in fund fee disclosure and that presentation of portfolio company expenses in this format in form n will facilitate understanding of portfolio company expenses requirement to disclose all fees and charges we are adopting as proposed the requirement that registrants disclose all fees and charges whether or not a specific caption is provided for a charge in the fee table a number of commenters objected to the proposal to require disclosure of all fees and charges particularly charges for riders in the fee table these commenters noted that rider charges generally apply to a limited number of policyholders are not considered significant features of a policy and could dominate a fee table and detract from the information about the base policy some commenters recommended instead that the commission limit the disclosure required in the fee table to fees and charges that are relevant to most policies or that may be charged to a typical investor we share commenters concern that investors not be overwhelmed by information of limited relevance at the same time however we do not believe that it is feasible to distinguish between charges for optional features that ought to be included in the fee table because they are expected to be selected by most or a majority of investors or by typical investors and charges for optional features that are expected to be less popular and hence should be omitted from the fee table we note that in recent years insurers have increasingly offered variable insurance products with a variety of socalled unbundled optional features each of which has a specific charge insurers maintain that these unbundled products are advantageous for investors because they allow investors to elect and pay for only those features that they want however this trend toward unbundling of features and charges would make the task of separating out those optional features that will be selected by a typical investor much more difficult consequently we are adopting the requirement as proposed we note however that a registrant may readily ensure that disclosure of rider charges does not overwhelm disclosure of base contract charges by for example disclosing rider charges at the end of the second section of the fee table under a caption that indicates that the charges are for optional features cost of insurance we are modifying the proposed requirement that registrants disclose in the fee table the minimum and maximum cost of insurance charges that may be imposed under a variable life insurance policy cost of insurance generally is a significant expense item for variable life insurance policyholders for that reason the commission believes that it is important for investors to receive information about the level of this charge the commission also recognizes however that this charge varies from policyholder to policyholder based on individual characteristics such as age gender and risk classification so that the charge does not readily lend itself to quantification in a table that applies to all policyholders commenters uniformly opposed the proposed requirement to disclose a range of the cost of insurance charge arguing that this approach would result in the presentation of numbers that would have little relevance to many investors commenters however were far from uniform in their recommendations to address this issue some commenters suggested that the commission require separate cost of insurance tables that disclose a range of cost of insurance rates for various issue ages rate classes genders and policy years noting that the added complexity of a more detailed presentation is outweighed by the benefit of more precise information about this charge which often represents the largest cost of a policy another commenter recommended disclosure of the cost of insurance charge for a policyholder with characteristics that are fairly representative of purchasers of a policy which we had identified in the proposing release as a possible alternative approach to disclosure of cost of insurance other commenters preferred a requirement to provide narrative disclosure about the cost of insurance such as disclosure of the factors that affect the cost of insurance charge and how the cost of insurance charge increases over the life of the policy we continue to believe that fee table disclosure of the cost of insurance can serve as a flag to prospective investors that this is a significant charge which bears further investigation we are also persuaded that disclosure of the range of cost of insurance will more effectively demonstrate the significance of this charge if it is coupled with disclosure of the cost of insurance paid by a hypothetical representative policyholder while the cost of insurance that will be paid by a prospective investor will likely differ from that shown for the representative policyholder disclosure of the cost of insurance for the representative policyholder together with disclosure of the minimum and maximum cost of insurance should give prospective investors a general understanding of the range of cost of insurance charges therefore we are requiring that registrants include in the fee table the cost of insurance charge that would be paid by a purchaser of the policy with characteristics eg sex age and rating classification that are fairly representative of actual or expected purchasers of the policy in addition to the minimum and maximum charges that may be imposed the requirements for the characteristics of the representative policyholder would be similar to the requirements for the characteristics of policyholders used in hypothetical illustrations and the registrant would be required to describe these characteristics in a subcaption for the charge to further address commenters concerns that the specific numerical cost of insurance information in the fee table would have limited relevance to any particular investor we are also requiring narrative disclosure i that the cost of insurance varies based on individual characteristics ii that the cost of insurance charge or other charge shown in the table may not be representative of the charge that a particular policyholder will pay and iii how a policyholder may obtain more information about the particular cost of insurance or other charges that would apply to him or her further we are permitting registrants to supplement this disclosure of the range of cost of insurance and the cost of insurance for a representative policyholder with additional disclosure concerning the cost of insurance immediately following the fee table this disclosure might include for example an explanation of the factors that affect the cost of insurance or tables showing the cost of insurance for a spectrum of representative policyholders permitting this additional disclosure responds to commenters concerns that simple numerical disclosure in the fee table may not be adequate to explain the cost of insurance to investors allowing additional disclosure will also permit registrants to experiment with different approaches which may over time assist us in developing a better approach to disclosure of cost of insurance charges requirement to disclose maximum charges the proposed fee table would have required disclosure of the maximum guaranteed charge for each item unless a specific instruction directs otherwise eg cost of insurance commenters that expressed views on this requirement recommended that the form permit registrants to disclose current charges along with the guaranteed charges arguing that placing current charge information in a footnote will not adequately disclose variations between current and guaranteed charges and that disclosing only the guaranteed charge may significantly overstate the amount of a charge to address commenters concerns the commission has revised item  to permit but not require registrants to disclose current charges in the fee table so long as the current charge disclosure is no more prominent than and does not obscure or impede understanding of the required maximum guaranteed charge disclosure captions in the fee table we are making some technical changes to address commenters concerns regarding the fee table captions we are modifying the instructions to the fee table to allow a registrant to modify or add captions if the captions shown do not provide an accurate description of its fees and expenses this modification recognizes that following the enactment of nsmia insurers have increased flexibility to structure variable life insurance charges subject to a requirement that those charges be reasonable in the aggregate the commission also has revised item  to require the heading periodic charges instead of annual charges at the beginning of the second section of the fee table this reflects the fact that some charges under variable life insurance policies may be assessed at intervals other than annually eg a monthly deduction for the cost of insurance charge portfolio company fees and charges we are adopting as proposed the requirement that for a registrant that offers multiple portfolio companies the fee table require disclosure of the range of expenses for all of the portfolio companies commenters were divided regarding how portfolio company expenses should be disclosed some commenters recommended that form n require registrants to include a complete presentation of the fees and charges for each portfolio company other commenters either supported the commissions proposal to require disclosure of the range of the expenses for all of the portfolio companies or recommended that the commission permit issuers to determine how to disclose portfolio company expenses as we stated in the proposing release we are concerned that because variable life fees and charges are complex and because policies frequently offer numerous portfolio companies as investment options investors could be overwhelmed by information if the fees and charges for each portfolio company were required to be separately stated in the fee table for this reason we have determined not to require a complete presentation of the fees and charges for each portfolio company to address the concerns of some commenters however that the particular fees and charges of a specific portfolio company are more important to investors than the range of fees and charges for all portfolio companies we are permitting but not requiring registrants to include disclosure of the fees and expenses for each portfolio company in addition to the disclosure of the range of expenses for the portfolio companies this will provide registrants the flexibility to include this detailed information when they determine that it would be helpful and not overwhelming to investors in addition we are revising form na to require the prospectus of a mutual fund that offers its shares as investment options for variable insurance products to include a fee table the fee table in form n contains a statement referring investors to the portfolio company prospectuses for more detail concerning portfolio company fees and expenses this will ensure that investors in variable life insurance policies have access to complete information about portfolio company fees and expenses we are also adopting as proposed the requirement that portfolio company operating expenses be disclosed before expense reimbursement and fee waiver arrangements expenses after reimbursement or waiver could be disclosed in a footnote this approach is consistent with form na we have deleted the instruction to the portfolio company expenses section of the fee table that would have required separate disclosure of the portion of other expenses that represents distribution or similar expenses deducted from a portfolio companys assets other than pursuant to a rule b plan this disclosure will be found in the prospectus for any portfolio company that deducts expenses of this nature and we do not believe that disclosure of the range of such expenses for all portfolio companies will be particularly meaningful  general description of registrant depositor and portfolio companies item  we are adopting as proposed item  which requires a concise discussion of the organization and operation of the registrant including a discussion of the rights of policyholders to instruct the insurance company depositor on the voting of portfolio company shares one commenter recommended consistent with proposed item  that a brief discussion of voting rights be included in the prospectus with more technical aspects disclosed in the sai another commenter suggested that all information about voting rights be included in the sai consistent with the approach of form na for mutual funds we have decided to retain the requirement that the variable life insurance prospectus concisely discuss policyholders rights with respect to voting portfolio company shares unlike an investor in a mutual fund the owner of a variable life insurance policy does not hold legal title to the shares of the underlying portfolio companies and a policyholders rights to vote on matters affecting the portfolio companies are less obvious than the rights of mutual fund investors  charges item  we are adopting item  which requires registrants to describe briefly all charges deducted from premiums cash value assets of the registrant or any other source with technical modifications to address commenters concerns as proposed item a would have required registrants to explain what is provided in consideration for each charge we have revised item  to require an explanation of what is provided in consideration for the charges rather than each charge where multiple charges are used as a combined pool of resources a registrant may describe what is provided in consideration for the charges as a group however where it is possible to identify what is provided in consideration for a particular charge this should be separately explained eg use of sales load to pay distribution costs of the policy or use of the cost of insurance charge to pay for insurance coverage we have also revised the language of instruction  to item a to avoid confusion between the cost of insurance rate and the cost of insurance charge which is the cost of insurance rate times the net amount at risk in addition we have clarified that disclosure regarding increased cost of insurance rates for healthy individuals attributable to simplified underwriting is required only when simplified underwriting would cause healthy individuals to pay higher cost of insurance rates than they would pay under a substantially similar policy that is offered by the insurer using different underwriting methods we have eliminated proposed item d which would have required a description of the type of operating expenses for which the registrant is responsible and if the organizational expenses of the registrant are to be paid out of its assets an explanation of how the expenses will be amortized and the period of amortization we agree with commenters who argued that information about expenses paid out of separate account assets would be reflected in the fee table and that additional disclosure about these specific categories of expenses would not be useful to investors in addition we note that organizational expenses may no longer be amortized in any event but must be expensed as incurred  taxes item  we are adopting as proposed the requirement that registrants describe the material tax consequences to the policyholder and beneficiary of buying holding exchanging or exercising rights under the policy registrants are required to discuss the taxation of death benefit proceeds periodic and nonperiodic withdrawals loans and any other distribution that may be received under the policy as well as tax benefits accorded the policy two commenters expressed the view that tax disclosure in the prospectus should be brief with more extensive technical disclosure located in the sai we believe that the requirements we are adopting will focus prospectus disclosure on the likely tax consequences to policyholders of purchasing a variable life insurance policy our intent as we stated in the proposing release is to elicit disclosure that is not overly lengthy or technical and that does not use jargon that is difficult for the average or typical investor to understand the commission notes its strong desire that in revising their prospectuses to comply with form n variable life insurance registrants pay particular attention to their existing tax disclosures to ensure that these disclosures do not discourage the use of variable life insurance prospectuses b part b  statement of additional information  financial statements item  location of financial statements we are adopting the financial statement requirements of proposed form n which were generally supported by commenters and are similar to those of form n substantially as proposed a variable life insurance prospectus will not be required to include the financial statements of either the registrant or the insurance company depositor the full financial statements of the registrant will be in the sai which will be available to investors upon request free of charge the sai will also contain comparative balance sheets for the last two fiscal years for the depositor and in certain cases a more current interim balance sheet for the depositor we are requiring that the other financial statements of the depositor eg statements of income and statements of changes in stockholders equity be included in the registration statement but they may be included in part c rather than the sai we are requiring that these financial statements also be made available to investors upon request free of charge form n would permit issuers to incorporate by reference into the sai the required financial statements of the registrant and the depositor subject to the rules of the commission on incorporation by reference the financial statements would have to be delivered with the sai in this case two commenters suggested changes to form n that would require financial statements to be delivered to an investor only if the investor requested an sai and not if the sai was delivered for other reasons these commenters noted that one state requires an sai to be delivered to any applicant for a variable life insurance policy and that this state requirement would result in high printing costs for variable life insurance policies sold in that state the commission has determined to retain the requirements as proposed the financial statements of the registrant may be useful to many investors and should be included in the sai directly or by incorporation by reference further the financial condition of the depositor is relevant to its ability to pay the insurance benefits offered under variable life insurance policies and therefore many investors may find financial information about the depositor useful the proposed approach to depositor financial information which requires that the sai contain only the depositors balance sheets will allow a shorter sai than would be the case if complete financial statements of the depositor were required while still providing investors with significant information about the financial condition of the depositor in the sai we are not persuaded that we should condition delivery of the financial statements which are an integral part of the sai upon whether an investor has requested the sai solely in order to alleviate the burden of state requirements preparation of depositor financial statements in accordance with gaap we are revising instruction  to item b to clarify when a depositors financial statements must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and when they may be prepared in accordance with statutory requirements as adopted instruction  to item b like instruction  to item b of form n would provide that a depositors financial statements may be prepared in accordance with statutory requirements if the depositor would not have to prepare financial statements in accordance with gaap except for use in a registration statement filed on forms n n or n instruction  includes a sentence not included in form n clarifying that the depositors financial statements must be prepared in accordance with gaap if the depositor prepares financial information in accordance with gaap for use by its parent in consolidated financial statements in reports under the securities exchange act of  exchange act or registration statements this sentence is consistent with the manner in which the commission staff has construed the existing instructions to form n ideally all financial statements for depositors of variable life insurance policies would be presented on a gaap basis because this would promote uniformity and consistency of presentation we believe however that our approach appropriately recognizes the cost burdens that would be imposed if we required gaap financial statements in cases where the depositor is not otherwise required to prepare financial information in accordance with gaap for use in its own registration statements or periodic reports or those of its parent company one commenter expressed concern that proposed form n could require a depositor to include financial statements in accordance with gaap if the depositor prepared gaap financial statements solely for internal purposes for example in a case where a mutual insurer desires to use gaap financial statements internally for several years before switching to gaap financial statements in its public filings we wish to clarify that form n would not require the use of gaap when a depositor prepares gaap financial statements solely for internal purposes  performance data item  the commission is adopting as proposed the requirements that the sai include i an explanation of how the registrant calculates performance data used in advertising including how charges are reflected in the data and ii a quotation of performance for each subaccount for which performance data is advertised in addition as proposed form n will neither require disclosure of any historical performance information nor prohibit the presentation of historical performance information in a variable life insurance prospectus provided that the information is not incomplete inaccurate or misleading and does not obscure or impede understanding of the information that is required to be included variable life insurance performance is difficult to measure because of the complexity of the product and because policy charges and values are linked to individual characteristics of a particular investor in addition variable life policies provide cash value and death benefits and both of these may be affected over time in different ways by policy charges and earnings the proposing release identified the following three types of performance information that are sometimes included in variable life insurance registration statements portfolio company performance this measure is net of investment management fees and other portfolio company fees and expenses but is not adjusted for fees and expenses imposed on the separate account or individual policyholders portfolio company performance adjusted for separate account assetbased charges this is a hybrid measure that is net of investment management fees other portfolio company fees and expenses and separate account assetbased charges but is not adjusted for charges imposed on individual policyholders illustrations of cash values and death benefits these illustrations are based on actual investment performance of a portfolio company and specified assumptions about premiums and the insured individual eg sex age rating classification reflecting all of the fees and charges at the portfolio company separate account and individual policyholder levels form n does not require disclosure of any historical performance information we believe as we stated in the proposing release that at the present time no method of measuring variable life insurance performance has been devised that is useful enough that its disclosure should be required commenters supported this approach commenters differed on whether the commission should restrict the forms of performance information permitted in a variable life insurance prospectus several commenters stated that all of the categories of performance information discussed in the proposing release may have informational value to investors and should be permitted in the prospectus provided that the limitations of the method chosen are described a few commenters expressed concerns about the presentation of portfolio company performance or portfolio company performance adjusted for separate account assetbased charges the commenters who were concerned about portfolio company performance argued that it does not reflect the return a policyholder might receive as accurately as would measures that reflect separate account charges in contrast a commenter who expressed concern about portfolio company performance adjusted for separate account assetbased charges stated that this measure of performance unlike portfolio company performance has no useful meaning but can mislead and cause misunderstanding because it reflects some but not all policy charges after considering these comments the commission has determined not to prohibit the use of any type of performance information in the separate account prospectus we agree with the commenters who argued that all of the categories of performance information discussed in the proposing release may provide useful information to investors we emphasize however that registrants are responsible for ensuring that any presentation of performance information is not incomplete inaccurate or misleading and does not obscure or impede understanding of the information that is required to be included in the prospectus for example a separate account using performance information that does not reflect all charges that a policyholder would incur directly or indirectly should include sufficient information about the omitted charges to ensure that the performance presentation is not misleading in addition as we indicated in the proposing release we believe that portfolio company performance information is most appropriately included in the portfolio companys prospectus where it can be considered along with the risks of investing in the portfolio company registrants should bear this in mind when determining whether it is appropriate to include portfolio company performance in the prospectus for the separate account  illustrations item  permitted use of hypothetical illustrations commenters supported the commissions proposal to permit but not require registrants to include hypothetical illustrations of a variable life insurance policy in either the prospectus or the sai and we are adopting the proposal hypothetical illustrations are tabular presentations of numbers that demonstrate how the cash value cash surrender value and death benefit under a policy change over time based on i assumed gross rates of return of the portfolio companies and ii deduction of fees and charges for a hypothetical policyholder eg a year old nonsmoking male with a specified policy face amount and premium payment pattern requirements for hypothetical illustrations the commission proposed requirements for any hypothetical illustrations included in the prospectus or sai in order to place reasonable limits on the assumptions that may be used and discourage the presentation of misleading illustrations we are adopting these requirements with modifications as discussed below we remind registrants that in addition to complying with these requirements registrants remain responsible for ensuring that illustrations are not incomplete inaccurate or misleading and do not because of their nature quantity or manner of presentation obscure or impede understanding of information required to be included in the prospectus or sai narrative information we are clarifying the requirement that a clear and concise explanation of the illustrations precede the illustrations specifically the explanation should include a description of the expenses reflected in the illustrations a statement that the illustrations are based on assumptions about investment returns and policyholder characteristics a description of the circumstances under which actual results for a particular policyholder would differ from the illustrations eg when policyholder characteristics expenses or investment returns differ from those illustrated and whether personalized illustrations are available and if so how they may be obtained we note however that this prescribed disclosure is not intended to be exclusive and that registrants should include any additional disclosure concerning the assumptions and limitations of the hypothetical illustrations necessary to ensure that the hypothetical illustrations are not incomplete inaccurate or misleading assumed rates of return the commission proposed to require registrants to use gross rates of return of  and one other rate not exceeding  additional gross rates of return not greater than  would have been permitted as adopted form n will require registrants to use gross rates of return of   and one other rate not greater than  additional gross rates of return no greater than  may also be used this is consistent with current practice in variable life insurance prospectuses which typically use gross rates of   and  in illustrations we proposed to require registrants using illustrations to use only two rates of return because as the number of rates increases the potential for overwhelming investors with excessive quantitative information that is of limited relevance to their particular circumstances also increases we proposed to cap permissible rates at  because of our concerns that rates above  may have a significant tendency to invite unrealistic investor expectations and that investors might give undue weight to a  illustration when coupled with a  illustration because they might discount a  illustration as unrealistically low a number of commenters recommended that form n require registrants using illustrations to use three rates of return rather than two arguing that the use of three rates more effectively demonstrates how variable life insurance policies operate and the effect that portfolio company returns have on cash values and death benefits in addition commenters generally recommended that the commission permit illustrations with rates as high as  arguing that  fairly depicts historical stock market returns we have modified our proposal to require registrants to use three gross rates of return    and one other rate not greater than  we agree with commenters that the use of three rates of return may effectively demonstrate how a variable life insurance policy operates in addition we are persuaded that illustrations using a  rate should not be prohibited in light of historical stock market returns although historical returns on large company stocks have averaged  from  to the present returns for these stocks have exceeded  for many    and year periods  as a result illustrations at a  rate when coupled with illustrations at  and  rates may not be materially misleading we note that each registrant should determine for itself whether the use of a  illustration is appropriate and not misleading under its particular facts and circumstances such as the historical returns of the policys portfolio companies and the actual and expected allocations by policyholders to various asset classes we continue to believe however that investors might give undue weight to a  illustration when coupled only with a  illustration and we therefore believe that it is important to require the use of a third intermediate rate premium amounts proposed item c would have required that the premium amounts used in illustrations not be unduly larger or smaller than the actual or expected average policy size we have modified the reference to policy size to clarify that we are referring to premium amount rather than policy face amount we have also modified the language of this item to address the concern of a commenter that averaging of premium amounts may result in a premium amount that is significantly different from the premium amount that is representative of the actual policies sold we are providing that premium amounts used in illustrations be representative of the actual or expected typical premium amount with flexibility to base the typical premium amount on the average or median premium amount or another reasonable basis that results in a typical premium amount that is fairly representative of actual or expected policy sales rating classification we are also modifying proposed item d which would have required that illustrations be shown for the rating classification eg nonsmoker smoker preferred standard with the greatest number of outstanding policies to address a commenters concern that this requirement may result in a rating classification being used that is not representative for example if a policy uses a large number of narrowly drawn rating classifications the rating classification corresponding to the greatest number of outstanding policies may fall at one extreme of the range of rating classifications eg the rating classification for healthy yearold nonsmokers and thus may not be representative for most purchasers we are modifying the item to provide that if use of the rating classification with the greatest number of outstanding policies is not fairly representative of policy sales illustrations should be shown for a commonly used rating classification that is fairly representative of policy sales portfolio company charges and expenses we are adopting as proposed the requirement that portfolio company management fees and other portfolio company charges and expenses be reflected using the arithmetic average of those charges and expenses for all available portfolio companies the average would be based on portfolio company charges and expenses incurred during the most recent fiscal year or any materially greater amount expected to be incurred during the current fiscal year a number of commenters opposed the required use of an arithmetic average arguing that a weighted average would better reflect the proportionate allocations that investors actually make in a particular product and would therefore serve as a better proxy for the portfolio company expenses that a prospective investor might actually pay four commenters recommended that form n permit the use of either a weighted or an arithmetic average of portfolio company expenses and three commenters recommended that the form require the use of a weighted average we disagree with commenters who recommended that we permit the use of either an arithmetic or weighted average of portfolio company expenses this approach would lead to inconsistency among illustrations the opportunity for cherrypicking the method that is most favorable from time to time and the need for complicated rules governing when a change in the selected method is permitted while we believe that there is some merit to the argument that a weighted average may serve as a better proxy for the portfolio company expenses that a typical prospective investor might pay we note that for any particular investor a weighted average is not necessarily representative of the expenses he or she will pay in addition computation of a weighted average is significantly more complicated than an arithmetic average for example requiring adjustments to the method to address new variable life insurance policies and the addition and removal of portfolio companies to or from an existing policy we wish to clarify however that although we are requiring the use of an arithmetic average of portfolio company fees and expenses in illustrations included in the prospectus and sai we would not object if personalized illustrations are provided to a particular investor based on a weighted average of the expenses of the portfolio companies in which the investor already invests or expects to invest provided that the illustrations are not misleading we believe that illustrations prepared in this manner may be significantly more useful to a particular investor than personalized illustrations using an arithmetic average of portfolio company expenses the proposed form would require that hypothetical illustrations reflect portfolio company charges and expenses without taking into account any fee waiver or expense reimbursement arrangements two commenters recommended that the form permit insurers to take into account fee waiver or expense reimbursement arrangements where the arrangements are binding either  for at least one year or until the next prospectus update or  until the end of the current fiscal year one of these commenters argued that as long as the arrangements are written commitments for at least one year or until the next prospectus update they reflect the actual fees and expenses that policyholders would experience as investors in the portfolio companies and therefore illustrations should be able to reflect these capped expenses the other commenter recommended that whatever expenses are actually used in a particular variable life prospectus should be used for purposes of hypothetical illustrations we have retained the requirement that hypothetical illustrations be based on portfolio company expenses before fee waiver or expense reimbursement arrangements this conforms to the fee table in item  which requires disclosure of portfolio company expenses before expense reimbursement and fee waiver arrangements however we intend that the staff construe the requirements of form n governing hypothetical illustrations consistent with the approach it has taken with the expense example of form na to permit illustrations to reflect portfolio company operating expenses after taking account of contractual limitations that require reimbursement or waiver of expenses but only for the period of the contractual limitation hypothetical illustrations based on historical rates of return the commission requested comment on the use of hypothetical illustrations constructed using historical rates of return for the portfolio companies hypothetical historical illustrations rather than assumed rates of return some variable life insurance registrants have included these illustrations in their prospectuses although this practice is not widespread proposed form n did not specifically address hypothetical historical illustrations and we are not modifying form n in this regard commenters views were mixed one commenter expressed concern about the use of actual historical performance to illustrate hypothetical future values and argued that to the extent actual results are used illustrations lose much of their hypothetical nature despite any disclaimer to the contrary another commenter noted that using hypothetical historical illustrations in the prospectus would result in extremely long illustrations adding to the complexity of the prospectus several other commenters argued that the commission should permit the use of hypothetical historical illustrations in the prospectus and sai by registrants who believe they contribute to investor understanding of a policy we continue to have a number of concerns about the use of hypothetical historical illustrations while hypothetical illustrations that show a pattern of assumed returns eg   and  may help investors understand how different rates of return affect policy performance historical rates of return illustrated in hypothetical historical illustrations will not follow a pattern and therefore are not useful to an investor attempting to understand how a particular change in rates of return might affect policy values in addition hypothetical historical illustrations have limited value in presenting past performance because they depend on the particular hypothetical policyholder face amount and premium payment pattern selected hypothetical historical illustrations also tend to invite prospective investors to assume that the cash values and death benefits presented represent the values that they can expect and may be misconstrued as projections finally hypothetical historical illustrations can add undue complexity to the information already presented to investors nonetheless we do not believe that it is appropriate to prohibit the use of hypothetical historical illustrations in the prospectus or sai provided that they are not incomplete inaccurate or misleading and do not because of their nature quantity or manner of presentation obscure or impede understanding of information that is required to be included we caution registrants however that it is incumbent upon them to ensure that any hypothetical historical illustrations comply with this standard personalized illustrations personalized illustrations are frequently provided by insurers to prospective variable life insurance investors at the point of sale these illustrations reflect the investors particular circumstances including age sex risk classification proposed face amount and expected premium payment pattern proposed form n did not address personalized illustrations because these illustrations are customized for individual investors delivered at the point of sale and are not susceptible to inclusion in a prospectus form n as adopted follows the approach of the proposal except that at the suggestion of several commenters we have added a requirement that registrants who make personalized illustrations available disclose that fact and provide a tollfree telephone number for requesting personalized illustrations as a result insurers may use personalized illustrations in sales literature subject to the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and rule  under the securities act as long as the sales literature is preceded or accompanied by the prospectus the antifraud provisions make it unlawful to use materially misleading sales literature in connection with the purchase or sale of investment company securities a significant number of commenters expressed the view that the commission should prescribe requirements for personalized illustrations either in form n or in another rulemaking or interpretive proceeding these commenters argued that mandating some degree of uniformity would benefit investors eg by facilitating comparisons among different policies the commenters suggested a range of approaches including standards for personalized illustrations that are similar to the requirements for hypothetical prospectus illustrations as well as standards conforming to the extent practicable to the national association of insurance commissioners standards for fixed life insurance policy illustrations the commission has determined not to propose standards for personalized illustrations at this time commenters views on the appropriate standards varied significantly and in some cases were not specific and we believe that it would be inadvisable to delay the benefits of form n in order to resolve differing views with respect to personalized illustrations in the proposing release we expressed our view that it may be misleading to market a variable life insurance policy based on illustrations that reflect assumed rates of return and the fees and charges of a single portfolio company when those fees and charges are less than the arithmetic average of fees and charges for all available portfolio companies for that reason we noted our concern about the practice of using a single portfolio companys fees and charges in personalized illustrations as described above however we would not object if personalized illustrations are provided to a particular investor based on a weighted average of the expenses of the portfolio companies in which the investor already invests or expects to invest provided that the illustrations are not misleading as a result if an investor invests or expects to invest in a single portfolio company it is not per se misleading to use that portfolio companys fees and charges in personalized illustrations for that investor we remain concerned however with personalized illustrations that use a single portfolio companys fees and charges in situations when an investor does not invest or expect to invest exclusively in that portfolio company particularly when that portfolio company has low expenses relative to other portfolio companies c part c  other information  exhibits  actuarial opinion item l we are adopting with modifications proposed item l which requires an opinion of an actuarial officer of the depositor if a registrant includes illustrations in the registration statement as proposed the actuarial opinion would have been required to indicate that i the values illustrated are consistent with the provisions of the policy and the depositors administrative procedures ii the rate structure of the policy and the assumptions selected for the illustrations do not result in an illustration of the relationship between premiums and benefits that is materially more favorable than for a substantial majority of other prospective policyholders and iii the illustrations are based on a commonly used rating classification and premium amounts and ages appropriate for the markets in which the policy is sold several commenters objected to the second prong of the actuarial opinion requirement arguing that it would require difficult judgments for which there are no established standards commenters also noted that the requirement that the relationship between premiums and benefits not be materially more favorable than for a substantial majority of other prospective policyholders could in some cases conflict with other requirements of proposed form n regarding hypothetical illustrations we agree with commenters that modifications are required to our proposal therefore we are replacing the second prong of the proposed actuarial opinion requirement with a requirement to indicate that the policy has not been designed and the assumptions for the illustrations including sex age rating classification and premium amount and payment schedule have not been selected to make the relationship between premiums and benefits as shown in the illustrations appear to be materially more favorable than for any other prospective purchaser with different assumptions d technical rule amendments when we proposed form n we also proposed several technical rule amendments to accommodate form n we are adopting these amendments as proposed the commission is amending rules b  a   and  under the securities act and rules b and b under the investment company act to add form n to the list of forms referenced in those rules we also are adopting new rules prescribing the use of form n to register insurance company separate accounts that are registered as unit investment trusts and that offer variable life insurance policies under the investment company act and to register their securities under the securities act finally we are amending form nb to clarify that form nb is not the proper form for investment company act registration of insurance company separate accounts registered as unit investment trusts e adoption of amendment to form na currently form na does not require a mutual fund that offers its shares exclusively as investment options for variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies to include the fee table in its prospectus in the proposing release we stated that if form n as adopted did not require separate disclosure of the operating expenses of each portfolio company we would amend form na to require the prospectus of a mutual fund that offers its shares as investment options for variable life insurance policies to include a fee table we also requested comment on whether to eliminate the exclusion from the fee table requirement in form na for mutual funds that offer their shares as investment options for variable annuity contracts if the exclusion is eliminated for mutual funds that offer their shares as investment options for variable life insurance policies the only commenter to address the issue of whether disclosure of portfolio company expenses should be required in the portfolio company prospectus supported a requirement that a mutual fund offering its shares as investment options to variable life insurance policies include a fee table in its prospectus the commenter agreed that the portfolio company prospectus is the appropriate location for disclosure of portfolio company operating expenses though the commenter also suggested that the form n fee table should not include any portfolio company operating expenses as proposed we are amending form na to eliminate the existing exclusion from the fee table requirement for mutual funds that offer their shares as investment options for variable life insurance policies this will ensure that variable life investors have access to complete information about portfolio company fees and expenses in addition to foster consistent presentation of fund expenses for variable annuities and variable life insurance we are eliminating the exclusion from the fee table requirement for mutual funds that offer their shares as investment options for variable annuity contracts f effective dates and transition period form n will eventually replace forms nb and s for insurance company separate accounts that are registered as unit investment trusts and that offer variable life insurance policies as discussed in the proposing release the commission is providing for a transition period after the effective date of form n that gives registrants sufficient time to update their prospectuses or to prepare new registration statements under the new form n requirements after the transition period separate accounts that are registered as unit investment trusts and that offer variable life insurance policies will be permitted to use forms nb and s only if they no longer offer their policies to new purchasers the commission however encourages registrants that are no longer offering policies to new purchasers to convert to form n since this format may be beneficial to both registrants and continuing investors all new registration statements and posteffective amendments that are annual updates to effective registration statements except for separate account registration statements that are no longer used to offer variable life insurance policies to new purchasers filed on or after december   must comply with form n the final compliance date for filing amendments to effective registration statements to conform with form n is december   a registrant may at its option comply with the requirements of form n at any time after the effective date which the commission is specifying as june   registrants on form na must comply with the amendment to form na with respect to all new registration statements and posteffective amendments that are annual updates to effective registration statements filed on or after september   registrants filing form n for purposes of updating their existing registration statements on forms nb and s will be deemed to be filing amendments to form n and should indicate this on the facing sheet these posteffective amendments should be filed under securities act rule a rather than rule b form n will require registration statement disclosure that is revised from that required by forms nb and s and in some cases such as the fee table information required by item  completely new because posteffective amendments filed to comply with the requirements of form n will involve a number of material changes to disclosure that do not fall within the scope of rule b registrants should file these amendments under rule a however we would not object if existing portfolio companies file their first annual update complying with the amendment to form na pursuant to rule b provided that the posteffective amendment otherwise meets the conditions for immediate effectiveness under the rule one commenter requested that because form n will include financial statements in an sai to be made available to investors upon request the commission permit existing registrants to make financial statements available only upon request while using forms nb and s during the transition period we have determined not to adopt the commenters suggestion we believe that form n taken as a whole represents a dramatic improvement in the disclosure that investors in variable life insurance policies receive therefore we believe that it would not generally be appropriate for a posteffective amendment to comply with some but not all of the requirements of the form g form n the commission requested comment on whether there is any continuing need for form n or whether it could be rescinded the form currently would be used only by an openend management investment company that is a separate account of an insurance company offering variable life insurance policies today virtually all separate accounts issuing variable life insurance policies are organized as unit investment trusts one commenter noted that several contracts registered on form n are still in existence but not actively marketed the commenter recommended that the form be retained because requiring these registrants to convert to a new format would be unnecessarily expensive and unproductive the commission has decided to retain the form n because of this continuing need for it i costbenefit analysis the commission is sensitive to the costs and benefits of its rules in the proposing release we requested comments and empirical data regarding the costs and benefits of proposed form n many commenters stated that the adoption of form n would significantly benefit the variable life insurance industry by reducing printing and postage costs for registrants issuing variable life insurance products and some commenters noted that these savings may be passed on to investors none of these commenters however provided specific data quantifying the costs or benefits of the proposed form a background variable life insurance is similar to traditional life insurance except that the cash value andor death benefit vary based on the investment performance of the assets in which the premium payments are invested premium payments under a variable life insurance policy unlike a traditional life insurance policy are invested in an insurance company separate account which generally is not subject to state law investment restrictions a variable life policyholder typically is offered a variety of investment options eg equity bond and money market mutual funds death benefits and cash values are directly related to performance of the separate account although typically there is a guaranteed minimum death benefit a separate account funding a variable life insurance policy most commonly is registered as a unit investment trust under the investment company act separate accounts registered as unit investment trusts are divided into subaccounts each of which invests in a different portfolio company both separate account unit investment trusts and the portfolio companies in which they invest are registered as investment companies under the investment company act and their securities are registered under the securities act investors in variable life insurance policies receive the prospectuses for both the separate account unit investment trust and the portfolio companies portfolio companies as mutual funds use form na to register under the investment company act and to register their shares under the securities act variable life separate accounts as unit investment trusts register under the investment company act on form nb and register their securities under the securities act on form s forms nb and s were designed for nonseparate account unit investment trusts and were adopted before the establishment of the first separate account to fund variable life insurance policies while much of their required disclosure is useful the forms request some information that is not typically of consequence to a buyer of variable life insurance more importantly many matters that would be significant to a buyer of a variable life insurance policy are not addressed at all by the forms to address these shortcomings the commission proposed form n unlike current forms s and nb form n is specifically tailored to variable life insurance form n will streamline variable life prospectus disclosure by adopting a twopart format consisting of a simplified prospectus designed to contain essential information that assists an investor in making an investment decision and a statement of additional information containing more extensive information and detailed discussion of matters included in the prospectus that investors could obtain upon request b benefits  reduced printing and postage costs as described above form n will employ a twopart disclosure format consisting of a simplified prospectus and a statement of additional information or sai as several commenters on the proposing release stated this twopart disclosure format would reduce needless printing and postage expenses significantly these savings could be substantial because many variable life insurance issuers send an updated prospectus to existing policyholders each year in particular under form n the financial statement disclosure of the registrant separate account and the insurance company depositor which is currently required to be included in the prospectus for the variable life insurance policy would be presented in the newly created sai or in part c of the registration statement and would generally only be provided to investors upon request the financial statements contained in variable life insurance prospectuses typically are between  and  pages in length and the printing and postage costs attributable to these financial statements may range from  to  depending on the number of copies printed and the length of the financial statements therefore based on an estimate of  variable life insurance policies registered with the commission the cost savings resulting from the exclusion of financial statements from variable life insurance prospectuses could range from  to  although we believe that an estimate at the lower end of this range is more likely one insurance company provided the staff with an estimate that it would have saved  overall in the printing costs of its  variable life insurance prospectuses if it had been able to exclude the financial statements from its prospectuses therefore the commission believes that the cost savings to issuers resulting from exclusion of financial statements from the form n prospectus could be significant further at least some of these cost savings could be passed on to investors we note that these cost savings may be reduced if investors in a variable life insurance policy request copies of the sai which will contain many of the financial statements currently required in the form s prospectus or if registrants must deliver copies of the sai to variable life investors for other reasons such as to meet state regulatory requirements some insurers may also need to incur costs in setting up and maintaining a system for processing requests for an sai including a tollfree telephone number however based on the staffs discussions with issuers regarding other investment company registration forms such as form n and form na we estimate that fewer than  of investors are likely to request an sai currently at least one state requests that issuers agree to deliver an sai to applicants for a variable contract  reduced filing costs the adoption of form n will allow variable life insurance registrants to use a single integrated form for investment company act and securities act registration eliminating unnecessary paperwork and duplicative reporting as a result of this simplified registration process the commission estimates that the annual net cost savings to issuers of variable life insurance policies for preparing and filing initial registration statements and posteffective amendments on form n will be  the annual costs of filing initial registration statements and posteffective amendments on forms s nb and n are summarized in the tables below and the discussion that follows cost of initial filings on forms s nb and n   form s form nb form n form n net cost savings number of filings      hours per filing      total hours      internal

amendments are filed by variable life insurance policies on form s annually we estimate the hour burden of an initial registration statement filed on form s at  hours which is similar to but slightly greater than the hour burden of an initial registration statement filed on form n which we estimate to be  hours the difference in this hour burden is attributable to the fact that form s on balance requires more information to be included in an initial registration statement than would form n thus we estimate internal costs involved in preparing an initial registration statement on form s based on a weighted average hourly wage rate of  at   hours x  we estimate external costs associated with completing an initial registration statement on form s to be  compared to  on form n these external costs include all costs associated with filing on form s other than wages salaries and fees paid for the hour burden these costs may include for example the cost of preparing a filing for the edgar system edgarization typesetting of the prospectus which is typically done before the prospectus is filed on edgar and the cost of outside counsel and independent auditors in connection with filing on form s the difference in external costs between form s and form n is attributable primarily to the fact that the required inclusion of financial statements in the form s prospectus results in significantly higher costs for typesetting and edgarization associated with filing a registration statement based on an estimate of internal costs of  and external costs of  per initial registration statement on form s therefore we estimate the total cost to a variable life insurance issuer of preparing and filing an initial registration statement on form s to be  thus total annual costs to variable life insurance issuers of filing initial registration statements on form s are estimated to be   x  there are also costs associated with filing posteffective amendments on form s the commission estimates based on the numbers of filings received on edgar in  that there are approximately  variable life insurance policies registered with the commission that file at least one posteffective amendment per year to update their financial statements these posteffective amendments may be filed pursuant to securities act rule a or rule b in addition to filing at least one posteffective amendment annually to update their financial statements the commission estimates that these variable life insurance policies also file an estimated  other posteffective amendments annually on form s these  other posteffective amendments are generally filed pursuant to securities act rule b to make nonmaterial changes to the registration statement and are generally more limited and much simpler to prepare than posteffective amendments filed as annual updates we estimate that the cost of preparing and filing a posteffective amendment to a previously effective registration statement on form s for the purpose of an annual update is  which reflects internal costs of   hours x  plus external costs of  while the estimated internal costs of filing an annual update on form s are the same as those for form n the estimated external costs of  are significantly higher than the comparable  costs for annual updates on form n largely because of higher costs for typesetting and edgarization resulting from the inclusion of financial statements in the form s prospectus thus the total annual cost to variable life insurance issuers of filing posteffective amendments on form s for the purpose of annual updates is   x  filings we estimate the cost of preparing and filing a posteffective amendment on form s for a purpose other than an annual update to be  which reflects internal costs of   hours x  plus other external costs of  these estimated costs are the same as those for filing such an amendment on form n thus we estimate that the requirement that variable life insurance separate accounts file on form s results in an annual cost to registrants of approximately   x    x    x  form nb the commission estimates that variable life insurance separate accounts file  initial registration statements and  posteffective amendments on form nb annually the current estimated cost of preparing an initial registration statement on form nb is  and the estimated cost of preparing each posteffective amendment on form nb is  thus we estimate that the requirement that variable life insurance separate accounts file on form nb results in an annual cost to registrants of approximately   x    x  form n the commission estimates that approximately  initial registration statements and  posteffective amendments will be filed on form n annually we estimate that the cost of preparing and filing an initial registration statement on form n will be  based on an estimate of  hours and  in external costs per initial registration statement as described above in addition we estimate that the cost of preparing and filing a posteffective amendment to a previously effective registration statement for the purpose of an annual update is  based on an estimate of  hours and  in external costs per annual update posteffective amendment as described above the estimated cost of preparing and filing a posteffective amendment on form n for a purpose other than an annual update is  the total annual cost to issuers of variable life insurance policies filing on form n is therefore estimated to be   x    x    x  thus we estimate an annual net savings in filing costs to issuers of variable life insurance policies of approximately  total annual costs of  associated with filing on form n compared to total annual costs of  associated with filing on forms s and nb  enhanced disclosure information form n will enhance the disclosure provided to investors about variable life insurance policies in several respects tailored registration form form n will eliminate requirements in forms s and nb that are not relevant to variable life insurance form n also will include items that are specifically addressed to variable life insurance products such as descriptions of contractual provisions relating to premiums death benefits cash values surrenders and withdrawals and loans plain english the commissions plain english rule will apply to the front and back cover pages and the riskbenefit summary in the variable life insurance prospectus this should result in better clearer disclosure to investors reducing complex and lengthy prospectus disclosure form n will streamline variable life prospectus disclosure by adopting a twopart format consisting of a simplified prospectus designed to contain essential information that assists an investor in making an investment decision and an sai containing more extensive information and detailed discussion of matters included in the prospectus that investors could obtain upon request standardized fee information form n will require variable life insurance registrants to provide a uniform tabular presentation of fees and charges in order to improve the disclosure to investors of the often complex charges associated with variable life insurance policies and increase the comparability of charges among policies this improved disclosure of the features of variable life insurance policies that will result from the adoption of form n will provide several important benefits first because of improved disclosure investors will be more informed about the features of different policies and will be able to spend less time searching for a variable life insurance contract that is best suited to their particular needs for example an investor who is interested in finding a variable life insurance policy with a particular set of features at the lowest cost may be able to do so more easily because the form n prospectus requires prominent disclosure of the risks and benefits of the policy and a standardized table of the fees and charges assessed by the policy in addition the improved disclosure required by form n will promote competition among issuers of variable life insurance policies as they seek to attract these more informed investors thus improved disclosure will result in more efficient allocation of investors assets among competing variable life insurance policies and also visàvis other competing types of financial products this beneficial effect may be somewhat limited however by the extent to which investors do not rely on a prospectus in choosing whether to purchase a variable life insurance policy but instead may rely on brokers and other investment professionals in determining whether to purchase a variable life insurance policy in some cases investment professionals may use the improved disclosure in the prospectus of form n to make more informed sales recommendations to investors second the improved disclosure promoted by form n may promote competition among issuers of variable life insurance policies and hence may also result in more efficient asset allocation among variable life insurance policies although it is not possible to quantify the beneficial effects of this increased competition we believe that they may be significant given that assets in variable life insurance products total approximately  billion and new variable life insurance premiums may equal  billion per year third because form n unlike forms s and nb will require disclosure specifically tailored to variable insurance policies the adoption of form n may permit the commission staff who review variable life insurance filings on form s to review these filings more quickly and efficiently and thus to provide investor protection more effectively in connection with the adoption of form n the commission is also amending form na the registration form for openend management investment companies by removing the current exclusion from the fee table requirement of form na for funds that offer their shares exclusively as investment options for variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies and requiring that these funds include a fee table in their prospectuses this amendment is being made because the fee table in the form n prospectus will allow variable life registrants to disclose the range of expenses for all portfolio companies offered through a variable life insurance policy in the variable life prospectus rather than having to separately state the fees and charges of each portfolio company this amendment to form na will ensure that variable life insurance investors continue to have access to complete information about portfolio company fees and expenses further because currently the requirements for disclosure of portfolio company fees and expenses in variable annuity and variable life prospectuses vary to a limited extent from the disclosure requirements of form na the amendment will produce consistent disclosure of fees and expenses by portfolio companies that offer their shares exclusively through separate accounts and by mutual funds that sell shares directly to the public this more consistent disclosure may result in more efficient allocation of assets among variable insurance products and mutual funds c costs variable life insurance issuers will incur a onetime cost for training in order for their personnel particularly lawyers and others who are responsible for supervising the preparation of variable life insurance filings to review and analyze the disclosure requirements of form n although form n is a new registration form much of the information required by form n is already required by existing registration forms further form n has been the subject of extensive discussion within the variable life insurance industry and many industry participants are already generally familiar with its requirements therefore we expect that this onetime cost will be significant but limited because we expect that in each insurance company issuing variable life insurance policies several lawyers and other supervisory professionals will require several hours of training in the disclosure requirements of form n we estimate that this cost will be  for each variable life insurance policy that is currently registered on form s and is actively being sold based on an estimate of  variable life insurance policies that are currently registered on form s we estimate these onetime costs attributable to the adoption of form n at   x  further because form n will require an insurer issuing a variable life insurance policy to deliver an sai to investors upon request and to maintain a tollfree telephone number for investors to use in requesting the sai some insurers may need to incur both fixed and variable costs in setting up and maintaining a system for processing these requests however because only a small percentage of investors are expected to request an sai these costs may be limited in addition because form n will allow financial statements to be included in the sai rather than the prospectus insurers may realize savings on fixed costs associated with typesetting the prospectus regardless of the numbers of investors who request an sai in addition to costs imposed by the adoption of form n the amendments the commission is adopting to form na will impose certain costs on funds registered on form na that offer their shares exclusively as investment options for variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies the commission estimates that  posteffective amendments on form na and  initial registration statements on form na are filed annually for fund portfolios that offer their shares exclusively as investment options for variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies and hence do not include a fee table in their prospectuses we estimate that the hour burden of adding fee table disclosure to these registration statements will be minimal because the fund portfolios must already compile and provide fee table information for issuers of variable insurance contracts that include these portfolios as investment options and hence provide information about their fees and expenses in the contract prospectuses therefore we estimate that the average hour burden per form na registration statement for adding this fee information will be  hours for either an initial registration statement or a posteffective amendment based on an estimated number of  portfolios per registration statement for a fund offering its shares exclusively as investment options for variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies the average hour burden per portfolio for adding this disclosure will be  hours we therefore estimate the annual industry cost of the amendments to form na to be  hours or  d conclusion based on information provided in the comment letters and its own analysis the commission believes that the adoption of form n will permit separate accounts issuing variable life insurance policies to register under the investment company act and to offer their securities under the securities act more efficiently and that in the long term the benefits of the new form justify the associated costs ii paperwork reduction act a adoption of form n as explained in the proposing release certain provisions of form n contain collection of information requirements within the meaning of the paperwork reduction act of   usc  et seq we published a notice soliciting comments on the collection of information requirements in the proposing release and submitted these requirements to the office of management and budget omb for review in accordance with  usc d and  cfr  the commission did not receive any comments on the paperwork reduction act portion of the proposing release as described above form n will be used by insurance company separate accounts that are registered as unit investment trusts and that offer variable life insurance policies form n will provide these variable life insurance separate accounts a single integrated form for investment company act and securities act registration for these separate accounts it will replace form nb currently used by separate accounts to register as unit investment trusts under the investment company act and form s currently used by separate accounts to offer their securities under the securities act a registration statement on form n will consist of a simplified prospectus that is designed to include items that are specifically addressed to variable life insurance products a statement of additional information that contains more extensive information that investors could obtain upon request and other information not included in the prospectus or the sai the information required by form n is primarily for the use and benefit of investors the form n prospectus will contain essential information to assist an investor in making an investment decision such as a description of contractual provisions relating to premiums death benefits cash values loans and surrenders and withdrawals the prospectus will also include a uniform tabular presentation of fees and charges which will improve disclosure and enhance the comparability of charges among policies information requirements in the current registration forms that are not relevant to variable life insurance will be eliminated from the form n prospectus the information required to be filed with the commission pursuant to the information collection will also permit the verification of compliance with securities law requirements and will assure the public availability and dissemination of the information in the proposing release the commission estimated the burden hours that would be necessary for the collection of information requirements under the proposed form n we have however revised certain estimates contained in the proposing release based on an analysis of the data contained in the commissions edgar system with respect to the number of initial registration statements and posteffective amendments filed on forms s and nb by separate accounts offering variable life insurance in the years  and  the commission estimates that there are approximately  variable life insurance policies issued by separate accounts registered as unit investment trusts the commission estimates that these separate accounts will file as many as  initial registration statements and  posteffective amendments on proposed form n annually in the proposing release the commission estimated that the hour burden for preparing and filing an initial registration statement on proposed form n is  hours we received no comments on this estimate and therefore we continue to estimate that the hour burden for an initial filing on form n is  hours thus the annual hour burden for preparing and filing initial registration statements on form n would be  hours  x  hours we estimate that the hour burden for preparing and filing a posteffective amendment on proposed form n for purposes of an annual update is  hours while additional posteffective amendments would require  hours thus the total annual hour burden for preparing and filing posteffective amendments on form n would be  hours  x  hours   x  hours the total annual hour burden for proposed form n therefore is estimated to be  hours  hours   hours the commission estimates that the cost burden for preparing and filing an initial registration statement on proposed form n is  this cost burden includes all costs associated with filing on form n other than wages salaries and fees paid for the hour burden these costs may include for example the cost of preparing a filing for the edgar system edgarization typesetting of the prospectus which is typically done before the prospectus is filed on edgar and the cost of outside counsel and independent auditors in connection with filing on form n thus the annual cost burden for preparing and filing initial registration statements would be   x  the commission estimates that the cost burden for preparing and filing a posteffective amendment on proposed form n for purposes of an annual update is  while the cost of preparing and filing an additional posteffective amendment is  thus the total annual cost burden for preparing and filing posteffective amendments on form n would be   x    x  the total annual cost burden for proposed form n therefore is estimated to be     omb approved the collection

to form na form na the registration form for openend management investment companies contains collection of information requirements within the meaning of the paperwork reduction act of   usc  et seq and the commission is submitting the proposed collections of information to the office of management and budget for review in accordance with  usc d and  cfr  the title for the collection of information is form na under the investment company act of  and securities act of  registration statement of openend management investment companies the information collection requirements imposed by form na are mandatory responses to the collection of information will not be kept confidential an agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number form na omb control no  was adopted pursuant to section a of the investment company act  usc a and section  of the securities act  usc e the purpose of form na is to meet the registration and disclosure requirements of the securities act and investment company act and to enable openend management investment companies to provide investors with information necessary to evaluate an investment in an investment company the commission is amending form na by eliminating the current exclusion from the fee table requirement of form na for funds that offer their shares exclusively as investment options for variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies and requiring that these funds include a fee table in their prospectuses this amendment is being adopted because the fee table in the form n prospectus will require variable life registrants to disclose the range of expenses for all portfolio companies offered through a variable life insurance policy rather than separately stating the fees and charges of each portfolio company in addition the commission is proposing amendments to conform the treatment of fund expenses in the fee table of form n the registration form for variable annuity contracts to that in form n the amendment to form na will ensure that investors continue to have access to complete information about portfolio company fees and expenses the commission estimates that  posteffective amendments on form na and  initial registration statements on form na are filed annually for fund portfolios that offer their shares exclusively as investment options for variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies and hence do not include a fee table in their prospectuses we estimate that the hour burden of adding fee table disclosure to these registration statements will be minimal because the fund portfolios must already compile and provide fee table information for issuers of variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies that include these portfolios as investment options and hence provide information about their fees and expenses in the contract prospectuses therefore we estimate that the average hour burden per registration statement for adding this fee information will be  hours for either an initial registration statement or a posteffective amendment based on an estimated number of  portfolios per registration statement for a fund offering shares exclusively to separate accounts the average hour burden per portfolio for adding this disclosure will be  hours thus we estimate that the amendment to form na will add  hours  posteffective amendments   initial registration statements x  hours to the previous form na annual burden of  hours resulting in a new total form na annual hour burden of  hours we request your comments on the accuracy of our estimate of the burden of the amendment to form na pursuant to  usc cb the commission solicits comments to i evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency including whether the information will have practical utility ii evaluate the accuracy of the commissions estimate of burden of the proposed collection of information iii determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality utility and clarity of the information to be collected and iv evaluate whether there are ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology persons submitting comments on the collection of information requirements should direct the comments to the office of

best assured of having its full effect if omb receives it within  days after publication of this release iii effects on efficiency competition and capital formation section c of the investment company act section b of the securities act and section f of the securities exchange act of  require the commission when engaging in rulemaking that requires it to consider or determine whether an action is consistent with the public interest to consider in addition to the protection of investors whether the action will promote efficiency competition and capital formation the commission has considered these factors the adoption and implementation of form n and the related amendment to form na will improve efficiency and competition among issuers of variable life insurance policies unlike forms nb and s that currently are used by variable life insurance issuers form n is specifically tailored to variable life insurance the requirements of the form focus on information that is essential to a decision to invest in a particular variable life insurance policy and the form is intended to enhance the comparability of information about variable life insurance policies for example form n will require variable life insurance registrants to provide a uniform tabular presentation of fees and charges assessed by a variable life insurance policy the enhanced disclosure of this essential information about charges and other features of a variable life insurance policy will enable investors to become more informed about the different aspects of variable life insurance policies and therefore will promote more efficient allocation of investors assets both among different variable life insurance policies and visàvis other competing types of financial products in addition the enhanced disclosure required by form n will promote competition among issuers of variable life insurance policies as they seek to attract these more knowledgeable investors while investors will be better equipped to make investment decisions following the adoption of form n it is unclear whether form n will affect capital formation iv regulatory flexibility act certification pursuant to section b of the regulatory flexibility act  usc b the chairman of the commission has certified that proposed form n does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities the initial certification was attached to the proposing release as appendix a we requested comments on the certification but received none pursuant to section b of the regulatory flexibility act  usc b

in length alternatively the prospectus may present items  and  for each of several contracts sequentially except that the information required by item  for any contract must precede the information required by item  for that contract if the information in response to item  for that contract exceeds five pages in length other presentations also would be acceptable if they are consistent with the
