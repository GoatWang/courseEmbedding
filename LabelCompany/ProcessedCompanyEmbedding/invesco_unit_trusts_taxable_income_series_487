your portfolio by weighting each bonds yield by its value and estimated life unlike estimated current return estimated long term return accounts for maturities discounts and premiums of the bonds

strategy the trust invests in a portfolio of intermediateterm corporate bonds and taxable municipal bonds including build america bonds qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds in selecting bonds for the trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others o all ratings provided for the bonds must be at least bbb if issued by either standard  poors or fitch ratings and at least baa if issued by moodys investors service inc or in the case of a bond with no issued ratings such a bond has credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the trust in the opinion of the sponsor o the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity o the current income provided by the bonds o the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and o the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk build america bonds were issued pursuant to provisions in the american recovery and reinvestment act of  the recovery act authorizing states and local governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a subsidy payment from the united states treasury treasury equal to  of the interest payable on such bonds on or about each interest payment date  for those build america bonds that qualify and are designated as recovery zone economic development bonds build america bonds must have been issued before january   to finance governmental purposes for which taxexempt governmental bonds excluding private activity bonds could be issued however the excess of available project proceeds over amounts in a reasonably required reserve fund may be used to

similar to certain build america bonds in that state and municipal qualified bond issuers may elect to receive direct interestsubsidy payments from the us treasury if certain conditions are met qualified school construction bonds are issued to finance the construction rehabilitation or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a bondfinanced facility will be constructed qualified energy conservation bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes and clean renewable energy bonds may be issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that produce electricity although the year of issuance is not restricted for qualified bonds federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may be issued for these bond types generally any qualified bond sale proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer three years after the issue date of such bonds will be redeemed within  days of the expiration of the threeyear period federal legislation imposes requirements on build america bonds and qualified bonds that issuers must continue to meet in order to receive ongoing federal subsidy payments the portfolio generally consists of corporate bonds and taxable municipal bonds maturing approximately  to  years from the date of deposit following the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced even to below investment grade bbb or baa and the trust could continue to hold such bond see trust administrationportfolio administration principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in the trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o bond prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o the value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future o a bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest andor principal payments in the future in particular should the issuer of a build america bond or qualified bond fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the recovery act it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments o the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o the financial markets including those for corporate bonds have recently experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility due to these significant difficulties in the financial markets there can be substantial uncertainty in assessing the value of an issuers assets or the extent of its obligations for these or other reasons the ratings of the bonds in the trusts portfolio may not accurately reflect the current financial condition or prospects of the issuer of the bond o a bond issuer might prepay or call a bond before its stated maturity if this happens the trust will distribute the principal to you but future interest distributions will fall a bonds call price could be less than the price the trust paid for the bond in particular qualified bonds may be redeemed approximately three years after issuance to the extent an issuer has unexpended bond sale proceeds if enough bonds are called the trust could terminate earlier than expected o we do not actively

the actual interest in the trust will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed by unitholders or until the termination of the trust agreement objective and bond selection the objective of an intermediateterm trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of intermediateterm bonds there is of course no guarantee that a trust will achieve its objective your trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with

investment grade ie below bbb or baa during the trusts life and the trust could continue to hold the bonds see the trustsrisk factors risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement which is available upon request contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment current economic conditions the economic recession in the united states which began in  technically came to an end in june of  however the us and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period including increased unemployment and belowaverage levels of economic activity the us and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat the effects of the economic crisis however the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted in december of  the us federal reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program however there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates over the previous five years on august   standard  poors rating services downgraded the longterm sovereign credit rating of the united states of america to aa from aaa citing the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate any substantial change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in your trusts holdings market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund foreign securities risk investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in securities of united states issuers these risks can increase the potential for losses in the trust and affect its unit price these risks may include risks such as losses due to political economic and social developments international trade conditions foreign taxes including withholding taxes restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of securities foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or repatriation of currencies the political economic and social structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the us and investments in these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts currency devaluations foreign ownership limitations and tax increases it is possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult for the trust to exercise investor rights and pursue legal remedies with respect to its foreign investments diplomatic and political developments including rapid and adverse political changes social instability regional conflicts terrorism and war could affect the economies industries and securities and currency markets and the value of the trusts investments in nonus countries no one can predict the impact that these factors could have on the trusts portfolio securities foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as us companies thus there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about most us companies certain foreign securities may be less liquid harder to sell and more volatile than many us securities this means the trust may at times be unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes interest rates in the united states are at or near historic lows which may increase the trusts exposure to risks associated with rising interest rates credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events build america bonds qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds in particular are often subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions see taxable municipal bondsbuild america bonds and taxable municipal bondsqualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds below the call provisions are described in general terms in the redemption feature column of the portfolio section and the notes thereto bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described in the following sections reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could lose income andor principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond both default in making their payment obligations liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent thereby adversely affecting the trusts net asset value no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange because of the difficulties currently being experienced by many companies in the financial services industry many markets are experiencing substantially reduced liquidity as a result of such illiquidity the trustee may have to sell other or additional bonds if necessary to satisfy redemption requests litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds taxable municipal bonds your trust may invest significantly or exclusively in taxable municipal bonds states municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds the sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment the types of bonds in your trust are listed under portfolio these bonds are also described in greater detail in the information supplement general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest all other municipal bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary build america bonds were issued pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of  the recovery act authorizing states and local governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy for a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by the united states treasury department treasury and the internal revenue service irs in an amount equal to  percent of the total coupon interest payable to investors  percent for those build america bonds that qualify and are designated as recovery zone economic development bonds the recovery act adds a new section to the internal revenue code of  as amended the code which authorizes build america bonds that meet the definition of qualified bonds as described below to receive the refundable credit the code section defines the term qualified bond to mean a build america bond a issued before january   b with  percent of the excess of i the available project proceeds as defined to mean sale proceeds of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon over ii the amounts in a reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue are to be used for capital expenditures and c where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to have this subsection of the code apply should a build america bonds issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on the bonds by the code it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments in addition build america bonds are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to sections aa or  of the code as added by the recovery act or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for a portion of a build america bond issuers borrowing costs qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds collectively qualified bonds are taxable bonds that are similar to certain build america bonds in that state and municipal qualified bond issuers may elect to receive direct interestsubsidy payments from the us treasury if certain conditions are met the hiring incentives to restore employment act enacted into federal law on march   permits issuers of qualified bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond interest payments qualified school construction bonds issued pursuant to provisions in the recovery act are issued to finance the construction rehabilitation or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a bondfinanced facility will be constructed qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds are both issued pursuant to the energy improvement and extension act of  and like qualified school construction bonds are governed by section a of the code qualified energy conservation bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes and clean renewable energy bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that produce electricity although the year of issuance is not restricted for qualified bonds federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may be issued for these bond types federal legislation has amended the code in recent years to provide for certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of qualified bonds and to include such bonds under the definition of qualified tax credit bond as found in section a of the code eligible issuers of qualified school construction bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to  of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal taxcredit bonds set daily by the us treasury eligible issuers of qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to  of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal taxcredit bonds set daily by the us treasury should the issuer of a qualified bond fail continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on any such bond by the code or other federal laws it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments or even causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds as provided in section a of the code qualified bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after three years from the date of issuance this mandatory redemption must be completed within  days after such threeyear period unless an extension is granted by the treasury additionally qualified bonds may be subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for any qualified bond issuers borrowing costs certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public

seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital principal investment strategy the trust invests in a portfolio of high yield corporate bonds maturing approximately  to  years from the date of deposit in selecting bonds for the trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others o each rated bond must either have a rating of at least ccc by standard  poors or fitch ratings or have a rating of at least caa by moodys investors service inc or in the case of a bond with no issued ratings such a bond must have credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the trust in the opinion of the sponsor o the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity o the current income provided by the bonds o the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and o the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk issuers of high yield bonds are often smaller lessseasoned companies or companies that are highly leveraged with more traditional methods of financing unavailable to them these bonds are almost always uncollateralized and subordinate to other debt that an issuer may have outstanding bonds rated below bbb by either sp or fitch or below baa by moodys are considered speculative and subject to high credit risk and are vulnerable to adverse business financial and economic conditions but currently have the capacity to meet financial commitments bonds rated ccc by either sp or fitch or rated caa by moodys are subject to very high credit risk and are at a substantial risk of default see description of ratings for additional details the portfolio generally consists of taxable bonds maturing approximately  to  years from the date of deposit following the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced and the trust could continue to hold such bond see trust administrationportfolio administration principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in the trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o bond prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o the value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise given the historically low interest rate environment in the us risks associated with rising rates are heightened the negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future o a bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest andor principal payments in the future o the trust invests in bonds rated below investment grade and are considered to be junk bonds bonds rated below bbb by either standard  poors or fitch or below baa by moodys are considered to be below investment grade these bonds are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks accordingly the risk of default is higher than with investment grade bonds in addition these bonds may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and may be more likely to make early returns of principal these bonds may also be subject to liquidity risks greater than those typically attributable to investment grade bonds the trusts price per unit yield and return may fluctuate more than in a trust consisting of investment grade bonds o the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o the financial markets including those for corporate bonds have recently experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility due to these significant difficulties in the financial markets there can be substantial uncertainty in assessing the value of an issuers assets or the extent of its obligations for these or other reasons the ratings of the bonds in the trusts portfolio may not accurately reflect the current financial condition or prospects of the issuer of the bond o a bond issuer might prepay or call a bond before its stated maturity if this happens the trust will distribute the principal to you but future interest distributions will fall a bonds call price could be less than the price the trust paid for the bond o certain of the bonds in the trusts portfolio are restricted securities that may be subject to enhanced liquidity risk this is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading in the security is limited or absent any bonds in the trust designated as rule a securities are subject to resale restrictions the value of your units may decrease if there is for any reason a lack of a liquid market for these securities o bonds of foreign issuers in the trust present risks beyond those of us issuers these risks may include market and political factors related to an issuers foreign market international trade conditions less regulation smaller or less liquid markets increased volatility differing accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign currencies o we do not actively manage the trusts portfolio except in limited circumstances the trust will hold the same bonds even

acquire individually diversification of a trusts assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds in addition bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of a trust are often not available in small amounts and may in the case of any privately placed bonds be available only to institutional investors on the date of deposit the sponsor deposited with the

number of units indicated under summary of essential financial information a trust that holds primarily bonds within the  to  year maturity range as described on the cover of the prospectus is referred to herein as a high yield trust unless otherwise terminated as provided herein the trust agreement will terminate at the end of the calendar year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in the case of a high yield trust each unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the principal and net income of the trust the number of units is determined based upon a  principal amount of bonds in the trust per unit to the extent that any units are redeemed to the trustee the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will increase although the actual interest in the trust will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed by unitholders or until the termination of the trust agreement objective and bond selection the objective of a high yield trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of high yield corporate bonds maturing approximately  to  years from the date of deposit there is of course no guarantee that a trust will achieve its objective your trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually in selecting bonds for each trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others a the ratings criteria applicable to your trust as listed under principal investment strategy b the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity c the current income provided by the bonds d the liquidity of the bonds e whether the bonds are designated as rule a restricted securities f recent trading activity of the bonds g the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and h the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires elimination of a bond from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see trust administrationportfolio administration see the trustsrisk factors risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement which is available upon request contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment current economic conditions the economic recession in the united states which began in  technically came to an end in june of  however the us and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period including increased unemployment and belowaverage levels of economic activity the us and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat the effects of the economic crisis however the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted in december of  the us federal reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program however there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates over the previous five years market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund high yield bond risk the trust invests exclusively in high yield bonds high yield or junk bonds are frequently issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development or by established companies who are highly leveraged or whose operations or industries are depressed high yield bonds are rated below bbb by either sp or fitch or below baa by moodys and are considered speculative as these ratings indicate a quality below investment grade for additional information regarding ratings definitions see description of ratings the prices of and yields on high yield bonds may fluctuate to a greater extent than those of higher rated bonds because high yield bonds are generally subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than higher rated bonds their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated bonds and are affected by economic political regulatory companyspecific and shortterm credit developments to a greater degree their values can decline significantly over short periods of time or during periods of economic difficulty when the bonds could be difficult to value or sell at a fair price high yield bonds are also subject to greater credit risk including the possibility of an issuers default or bankruptcy than bonds in higher rating categories an economic slowdown or a reduction in an issuers creditworthiness may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal payments the risk of default among high yield bonds is also enhanced since these securities are generally subordinated obligations within an issuers overall capital structure generally no payment with respect to subordinated indebtedness such as a high yield bond in the trust may be made while there exists a default with respect to any senior indebtedness thus in the event of insolvency holders of senior indebtedness of an issuer generally will recover more ratably than holders of subordinated indebtedness of that issuer should the issuer of any high yield bond default in the payment of principal or interest the trust may incur additional expenses seeking payment on the defaulted bond because amounts if any recovered by the trust in payment under the defaulted bond may not be reflected in the value of the trusts units until actually received by the trust and depending upon when a unitholder purchases or sells his or her units it is possible that a unitholder would bear a portion of the cost of recovery without receiving any portion of the payment recovered the market for high yield bonds is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade bonds high yield bonds are generally not listed on a national securities exchange but trade in the overthecounter markets due to the smaller less liquid market for high yield bonds the bidoffer spread on such bonds is generally greater than it is for investment grade bonds and the purchase or sale of such bonds may take longer to complete further the trust may have difficulty selling certain high yield bonds at the desired time and price less liquidity could adversely affect the price at which the trust could sell a particular high yield bond and could cause significant fluctuations in the net asset value of the trusts units the lack of a liquid trading market may also make it more difficult for the trust to obtain accurate market quotations from the evaluator in valuing high yield bonds accordingly elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation in the rare circumstance that fair valuation methods are utilized certain of the high yield bonds in the trust are designated as rule a restricted securities rule a securities pursuant to the securities act of  as amended  act and may be subject to enhanced liquidity risk restricted securities may be sold only in privately negotiated transactions or in a public offering with respect to a registration statement which is in effect under the  act rule a securities are restricted securities that may only be resold in accordance with the applicable provisions of the  act rule a establishes a safe harbor from the registration requirements of the  act permitting the resale of restricted securities by the trust to qualified institutional buyers the only restricted securities in which the trust invests are rule a securities subsequently the overall liquidity of the trust may decrease to the extent the trusts restricted securities or any of the trusts high yield bonds are not readily marketable or become illiquid at the time the trust may be seeking to sell such securities such as for a request for redemption an insufficient number of qualified institutional buyers interested in purchasing restricted securities held by the trust may adversely affect the marketability of such securities and the trustee might be unable to dispose of any illiquid trust securities promptly or at reasonable prices since it is not possible to predict with assurance exactly how the market for a particular high yield or rule a restricted security will develop the sponsor will carefully monitor all the trusts investments focusing on such factors among others as valuation liquidity and availability of information in the extraordinary circumstance where registration is required for the resale of a restricted security additional expenses may be incurred and a considerable period may elapse from the time the trustee attempts to sell such restricted trust securities and the time the trustee may be permitted to sell the restricted trust securities under an effective registration statement under circumstances such as these the trustee may experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within three business days when faced with periods of enhanced illiquidity foreign securities risk investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in securities of united states issuers these risks can increase the potential for losses in the trust and affect its unit price these risks may include risks such as losses due to political economic and social developments international trade conditions foreign taxes including withholding taxes restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of securities foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or repatriation of currencies the political economic and social structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the us and investments in these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts currency devaluations foreign ownership limitations and tax increases it is possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult for the trust to exercise investor rights and pursue legal remedies with respect to its foreign investments diplomatic and political developments including rapid and adverse political changes social instability regional conflicts terrorism and war could affect the economies industries and securities and currency markets and the value of the trusts investments in nonus countries no one can predict the impact that these factors could have on the trusts portfolio securities foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as us companies thus there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about most us companies certain foreign securities may be less liquid harder to sell and more volatile than many us securities this means the trust may at times be unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes interest rates in the united states are at or near historic lows which may increase the trusts exposure to risks associated with rising interest rates certain bonds in your trust may be subject to interest rate adjustments if either moodys or standard  poors or in certain limited circumstances another ratings service downgrades the rating for such bond or upgrades the rating after such a downgrade the interest rates payable on certain bonds in your trust may have already been increased due to past ratings downgrades any future credit rating improvements on such bonds may result in decreases to the interest rates payable on such bonds and consequently may adversely affect both the income you receive from the securities in the trust and the value of your units on the other hand increases in a bonds interest rate related to decreases in such bonds credit rating may place additional financial strain on the bonds issuer which could result in further decreases in financial condition and further credit rating decreases additionally an increase in a bonds interest rate may increase the risk that the bonds issuer will prepay or call the bond before its stated maturity credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events the call provisions are described in general terms in the redemption feature column of the portfolio section and the notes thereto bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described in the following sections reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent thereby adversely affecting the trusts net asset value the market for certain investments may become less liquid or illiquid due to adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or due to adverse market or economic conditions in the absence of a liquid trading market for a particular security the price at which such security may be sold to meet redemptions as well as the value of the units of your trust may be adversely affected no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond in the trust because these bonds all generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange in the event that any bond becomes illiquid the trustee may have to sell other or additional bonds if necessary to satisfy redemption requests additional discussion of liquidity as it relates to high yield bonds is included in the high yield bond risk section above litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds corporate bond industry risks your trust may invest significantly in certain industries any negative impact on the related industry will have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries you should understand the risks of these industries before you invest consumer discretionary and consumer staples issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products general risks of these companies include the overall state of the economy intense competition and consumer spending trends a decline in the economy which results in a reduction of consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits global factors including political developments imposition of import controls fluctuations in oil prices and changes in exchange rates may adversely affect issuers of consumer products and services competitiveness in the retail industry may require large capital

companies companies in the financial services industry include but are not limited to companies involved in activities such as banking mortgage finance consumer finance specialized finance industrial finance and leasing investment banking and brokerage asset management and custody corporate lending insurance and financial investment and real estate including real estate investment trusts in general financial services issuers are substantially affected by changes in economic and market conditions including the liquidity and volatility levels in the global financial markets interest rates as well as currency and commodities prices investor sentiment the rate of corporate and consumer defaults inflation and unemployment the availability and cost of capital and credit exposure to various geographic markets or in commercial and residential real estate competition from new entrants in their fields of business extensive government regulation and the overall health of the us and international economies the financial services sector was adversely affected by global developments stemming from the financial crisis including recessionary conditions deterioration in the credit markets and recurring concerns over sovereign debt a substantial amount of assets were written down by financial institutions with the impact of these losses forcing a number of large traditional banks investment banks brokerdealers and insurers into liquidation combination or other restructuring this also significantly increased the credit risk and possibility of default of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these problems in addition the liquidity of certain debt instruments has been reduced or eliminated due to the lack of available market makers while the us and foreign governments and their respective government agencies have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with financial institutions there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in financial services issuers will decrease as a result of these steps most financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a profit from a given line of business challenging economic and political conditions along with increased public scrutiny during the past several years have led to new legislation and increased regulation in the us and abroad creating additional difficulties for financial institutions regulatory initiatives and requirements that are being proposed around the world may be inconsistent or may conflict with regulations to which financial services issuers are currently subject thereby resulting in higher compliance and legal costs as well as the potential for higher operational capital and liquidity costs proposed or enacted regulations may further limit the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments certain financial services issuers can make and further may limit the interest rates and fees they can charge the prices they can charge and the amount of capital they must maintain these laws and regulations may affect the manner in which a particular financial institution does business and the products and services it may provide increased regulation may restrict a companys ability to compete in its current businesses or to enter into or acquire new businesses new regulations may reduce or limit a companys revenue or impose additional fees limit the scope of their activities increase assessments or taxes on those companies and intensify regulatory supervision adversely affecting business operations or leading to other negative consequences among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial crisis has been the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act enacted into federal law on july   the doddfrank act includes reforms and refinements to modernize existing laws to address emerging risks and issues in the nations evolving financial system it also establishes entirely new regulatory regimes including in areas such as systemic risk regulation overthecounter derivatives market oversight and federal consumer protection the doddfrank act is intended to cover virtually all participants in the financial services industry for years to come including banks thrifts depository institution holding companies mortgage lenders insurance companies industrial loan companies brokerdealers and other securities and investment advisory firms private equity and hedge funds consumers numerous federal agencies and the federal regulatory structure in particular certain provisions of the doddfrank act increase the capital requirements of certain financial services companies supervised by the federal reserve resulting in such companies incurring generally higher deposit premiums these types of regulatory changes may have adverse effects on certain issuers in your trust and could lead to decreases in such issuers profits or revenues in many cases the full impact of the doddfrank act on a financial institutions business remains uncertain because of the extensive rulemaking still to be completed the sponsor is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and any resulting regulation on the securities in your trust or on the financial services industry in general financial services companies in foreign countries are also subject to regulatory and interest rate concerns in particular government regulation in certain foreign countries may include controls on interest rates credit availability prices and currency transfers negative developments regarding eurozone sovereign debt including the potential for further downgrades of sovereign credit ratings as well as downgrades to the ratings of the us governments sovereign credit rating could adversely affect financial services issuers in addition the departure of any eurozone country from use of the euro could lead to serious disruptions to foreign exchanges operations and settlements which may have an adverse effect on financial services issuers the financial condition of customers clients and counterparties including other financial institutions could adversely affect financial services issuers financial services issuers are interrelated as a result of market making trading clearing or other counterparty relationships many of these transactions expose financial services issuers to credit risk as a result of the actions of or deterioration in the commercial soundness of other counterparty financial institutions economic and market conditions may increase credit exposures due to the increased risk of customer client or counterparty default downgrades to the credit ratings of financial services issuers could have a negative effect on liquidity cash flows competitive position financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting access to funding or capital markets increasing borrowing costs or triggering increased collateral requirements financial services issuers face significant legal risk both from regulatory investigations and proceedings as well as private actions profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally banks face competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes have permitted new entrants to offer various financial products technological advances allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks continue to face tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks bank profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and may fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition further economic conditions in the real estate market may have a particularly strong effect on certain banks and savings associations declining real estate values could adversely affect financial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing activities directly or indirectly connected to the value of real estate companies engaged in investment management and brokerdealer activities are subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceed the volatility of the equity market in general adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including interest rate movements the

sales tax obligations and profitability health care issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by health care companies these issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotechnology managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies these companies face substantial government regulation and approval procedures general risks of health care companies include extensive competition product liability litigation and evolving government regulation on march   the health care and education reconciliation act of  incorporating the patient protection and affordable care act collectively the act was enacted into law the act continues to have a significant impact on the health care sector through the implementation of a number of reforms in a complex and ongoing process with varying effective dates significant provisions of the act include the introduction of required health care coverage for most americans significant expansion in the number of americans eligible for medicaid modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families the act also provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to preexisting conditions although the entirety of the act will not come into effect until  in the interim health care companies will face continuing and significant changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased costs and changes in the health care market the sponsor is unable to predict the full impact of the act on the securities in your trust as illustrated by the act congress may from time to time propose legislative action that will impact the health care sector the proposals may span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which may include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs incentives for competition in the provision of health care services promotion of prepaid health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the health care sector the government could also reduce funding for health care related research drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales product obsolescence increased government regulation termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a product will never come to market the research and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial this process involves lengthy government review with no guarantee of approval these companies may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years if at all the failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a company and its stock the goods and services of health care issuers are also subject to risks of malpractice claims product liability claims or other litigation health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services the ability of the facility to provide required services an increased emphasis on outpatient services confidence in the facility management capabilities competitive forces that may result in price discounting efforts by insurers and government agencies to limit rates expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and termination or restriction of government financial assistance such as medicare medicaid or similar programs industrials issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by industrials companies general risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy intense competition imposition of import controls volatility in commodity prices currency exchange rate fluctuation consolidation labor relations domestic and international politics excess capacity and consumer spending trends companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending and leverage levels economic cycles technical obsolescence delays in modernization limitations on supply of key materials depletion of resources government regulations government contracts and ecommerce initiatives industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their individual

trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies in the materials industry companies in the materials sector could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility exchange rates import controls and increased competition production of materials often exceeds demand as a result of overbuilding or economic downturns leading to poor investment returns companies in the materials sector are at risk for environmental damage and product liability claims companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by depletion of resources technical progress labor relations and governmental regulations telecommunications issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by telecommunications companies this sector is primarily characterized by extensive government regulation and intense competition companies in the telecommunications industry allocate significant resources in efforts to comply with applicable government regulations telecommunications companies operating in the us must comply with applicable state and federal regulations including those of the federal communications commission the costs of complying with governmental regulations delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies recent industry consolidation trends may lead to increased regulation in primary markets internationally telecommunications companies may face regulatory challenges such as securing premarketing clearance of products and prices which may be arbitrary and unpredictable us federal and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a company may offer us federal legislation governing the telecommunications industry may become subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect certain telecommunications issuers the competitive landscape in the telecommunications sector is intense and constantly evolving the products and services of these companies may become outdated very rapidly a companys performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological advances at the same time demand for some telecommunications services remains weak as several key markets are oversaturated and many customers can choose between several service providers and technology platforms to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines certain telecommunications companies may be engaged in fierce competition for a share of the market of their products and may have higher costs including liabilities associated with the medical pension and postretirement expenses of their workforce than their competitors as a result competitive pressures are intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility moreover continued consolidation in this industry could create integration expenses and delay and consequent management diversion of attention away from ongoing operations and related risks among other factors could result in the failure of these companies to realize expected cost savings or synergies several highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies in the past have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of the telecommunications industry high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s caught up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny moreover some companies have begun the process of emerging from bankruptcy and may have reduced levels of debt and other competitive advantages over other telecommunications companies due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies remains substantial and may continue to rise information technology issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by information technology companies these companies include companies that are involved in computer and business services enterprise softwaretechnical software internet and computer software internetrelated services networking and telecommunications equipment telecommunications services electronics products server hardware computer hardware and peripherals semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductors these companies face risks related to rapidly changing technology rapid product obsolescence cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions companies in this sector face risks from rapid changes in technology competition dependence on certain suppliers and supplies rapid obsolescence of products or services patent termination cyclical market pattern evolving industry standards frequent new products and government regulation these companies can also be adversely affected by interruption or reduction in supply of components or loss of key customers and failure to comply with certain industry standards an unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on a company the failure of a company to introduce new products or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology can have a negative impact on the companys results information technology companies may also be smaller andor less experienced companies with limited product lines markets or resources stocks of some internet companies have high pricetoearnings ratios with little or no earnings histories information technology stocks tend to experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading announcements about new products technologies operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock prices to fluctuate dramatically at times however extreme price and volume fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of a company this can impact your ability to redeem your units at a price equal to or greater than what you paid energy issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by energy companies energy companies can be significantly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of energy fuels such as crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuels extended periods of low energy fuel prices can have a material adverse impact on an energy companys financial condition and results of operations the prices of energy fuels can be materially impacted by general economic conditions demand for energy fuels industry inventory levels production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated disruptions and damage competing fuel prices and geopolitical risks recently the price of crude oil natural gas and other fossil fuels has declined substantially and experienced significant volatility which has adversely impacted energy companies and their stock prices and dividends the price of energy fuels may decline further and have further adverse effects on energy companies some energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire additional energy reserves the exploration and recovery process involves significant operating hazards and can be very costly an energy company has no assurance that it will find reserves or that any reserves found will be economically recoverable the energy industry also faces substantial government regulation including environmental regulation regarding air emissions and disposal of hazardous materials these regulations may increase costs and limit production and usage of certain fuels additionally governments have been increasing their attention to issues related to greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change and regulatory measures to limit or reduce ghg emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation ghg emissionsrelated regulations could substantially harm energy companies including by reducing the demand for energy fuels and increasing compliance costs energy companies also face risks related to political conditions in oil producing regions such as the middle east political instability or war in these regions could negatively impact energy companies the operations of energy companies can be disrupted by natural or human factors beyond the control of the energy company these include hurricanes floods severe storms and other weather events civil unrest accidents war earthquakes fire political events systems failures and terrorist attacks any of which could result in suspension of operations energy companies also face certain hazards inherent to operating in their industry such as accidental releases of energy fuels or other hazardous materials explosions and mechanical failures which can result in environmental damage loss of life loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption of operations utility issuers the trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by utility companies or in companies related to the utility or energy industries many utility companies especially electric and gas and other energy related utility companies are subject to various uncertainties including o risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs o restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result of environmental nuclear safety and other regulations o regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer o coping with the general effects of energy conservation o technological innovations which may render existing plants equipment or products obsolete o the effects of unusual unexpected or abnormal local weather o maturing markets and difficulty in expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors o the potential impact of natural or manmade disasters o difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital even if frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions o the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation o difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and equity securities o increased competition and o international politics any of these factors or a combination of these factors could affect the supply of or demand for energy such as electricity or natural gas or water or the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could adversely affect the profitability of the issuers of the bonds and the performance of the trust utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal level in the united states and many are regulated at the state level as well the value of utility company stocks may decline because governmental regulation affecting the utilities industry can change this regulation may prevent or delay the utility company from passing along cost increases to its customers which could hinder the utility companys ability to meet its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings by its creditors against such utility company furthermore regulatory authorities which may be subject to political and other pressures may not grant future rate increases or may impose accounting or operational policies any of which could adversely affect a companys profitability and its stock price certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years these utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business these opportunities may permit certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates of return some companies however may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable while regulated providers tend to have regulated returns nonregulated providers returns are not regulated and generally are more volatile these developments have reduced stability of cash flows in those states with nonregulated providers and could impact the shortterm earnings potential of some in this industry these trends have also made shares of some utility companies less sensitive to interest rate changes but more sensitive to changes in revenue and earnings and caused them to reduce the ratio of their earnings they pay out as dividends certain utilities companies face risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities for electric generation including among other considerations litigation the problems associated with the use of radioactive materials and the effects of natural or manmade disasters in general certain utility companies may face additional regulation and litigation regarding their power plant operations increased costs from new or greater regulation of these operations and expenses related to the purchase of emissions control equipment more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also included in the portfolio and notes thereto this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to your trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the sponsor delivers the bond to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them in order to acquire certain bonds it may be necessary for the sponsor or trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on the date of deposit this cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the first settlement date the trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from interest payments on the related bonds also since interest on any when as and if issued bonds does not begin accruing to the benefit of unitholders until the date of delivery the trustee may reduce its fee and pay trust expenses in order to maintain or approach the same estimated net annual interest income during the first year of the trusts operations as described under summary of essential financial information no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns  the estimated current return and the estimated longterm return as of the date of deposit are set forth under summary of essential financial information estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in the interest rates applicable to the bonds some of which may be subject to adjustments related to changes in the bonds ratings as provided by certain ratings services fees and expenses of your trust and with the principal prepayment default if any redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of your trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price public offering  general units are offered at the public offering price during the initial offering period the public offering price is based on the aggregate offering price of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account including cash to pay organization costs and accrued interest if any the maximum sales charge for a high yield trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds organization costs are not included in the public offering price per unit for purposes of calculating the sales charge after the initial public offering period the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase in the primary and secondary market is one unit certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases the maximum secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following table based upon the estimated longterm return life in years eltr life of your trusts portfolio eltr life years sales charge

for purposes of calculating estimated longterm return see estimated current and longterm returns the sales charges in the above table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market public offering price per unit for example the maximum secondary market sales charge for a trust with an eltr life of  but less than  years would be  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate bid price of the bonds reducing your sales charge the sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to reduce the sales charge that you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert the

price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding this price determination was made on the basis of an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the evaluator during the initial offering period the evaluator will value the bonds as of the evaluation time on days the new york stock exchange is open for business and will adjust the public offering price of units accordingly the evaluation time is the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for regular trading or earlier on days where the bond market association recommends an early bond market close provided however on the date of deposit the evaluation time will be the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed

tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat certain distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year a distribution paid by your trust reduces the trusts net asset value per unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution accordingly a distribution paid shortly after a purchase of units by a unitholder would be subject to income tax even though it may be viewed in substance as a partial return of capital dividends received deduction and qualified dividend income a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies that do not invest in stock an individual that owns units generally will not be entitled to treat trust distributions as qualified dividend income currently taxed at longterm capital gains rates as it is not expected that trust distributions will be attributable to qualified dividend income received by the trust sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your initial tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net short term capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is long term if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes in general any gain on the sale will be treated as capital gain and any loss will be treated as capital loss however any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that units disposed of are replaced within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after the disposition of units or to the extent that the unitholder during such period acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities in such a case the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units in general this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will recognize gain or loss based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received and subject to certain limitations on the deductibility of losses under the tax rules deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income such deductions may be subject to limitation for taxpayers whose income exceeds certain levels foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends that the trust reports as capital gain dividends and will generally be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions however distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met distributions received by a foreign investor attributable to interestrelated dividends of a regulated investment company such as the trust may not be subject to us federal income tax withholding the amount of distributions that may be reported as interestrelated dividends will be limited to the amount of qualified net interest income which is generally the trusts ussource interest income less allocable expenses the foreign account tax compliance act fatca a  withholding tax on your trusts distributions including capital gains distributions and on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of units generally applies if paid to a foreign entity unless i if the foreign entity is a foreign financial institution as defined under fatca the foreign entity undertakes certain due diligence reporting withholding and certification obligations ii if the foreign entity is not a foreign financial institution it identifies certain of its us investors or iii the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under fatca if required under the rules above and subject to the applicability of any intergovernmental agreements between the united states and the relevant foreign country withholding under fatca is applies i with respect to distributions from your trust and ii with respect to certain capital gains distributions and gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of units that occur on or after january   if withholding is required under fatca on a payment related to your units investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding or that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding on such payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the irs to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction your trust will not pay any additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under fatca you should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of fatca based on your individual circumstances backup withholding by law your trust must withhold as backup withholding a percentage currently  of your taxable distributions and redemption proceeds if you do not provide your correct social security or taxpayer identification number and certify that you are not subject to backup withholding or if the irs instructs your trust to do so investors should consult their tax advisors investors in the trust may be subject to federal state local or foreign taxes in connection with their investment in the trust investors are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal state local and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of an investment in the trust expenses  general the trustee will periodically deduct from the interest account and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the principal account amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trusts provided that organization costs are generally paid out of cash deposited in the principal account the trustee also may withdraw from these accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the trusts amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trusts assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts organization costs you and the other unitholders will bear all or a portion of the organization costs and charges incurred in connection with the establishment of your trust these costs and charges will include the cost of the preparation printing and execution of the trust agreement registration statement and other documents relating to your trust federal and state registration fees and costs the initial fees and expenses of the trustee and legal and auditing expenses the public offering price of units includes the estimated amount of these costs the trustee will deduct these expenses from your trusts assets at the end of the initial offering period or after six months if earlier sponsor supervisor evaluator and trustee the sponsor

trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such amounts description of ratings  standard  poors a division of the mcgrawhill companies a standard  poors longterm debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation this opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation the longterm debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold the debt obligation inasmuch as they do not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor the longterm debt obligation credit ratings are based on current information furnished by the obligor or obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit in connection with any credit rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information credit ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or based on other circumstances the longterm debt obligation credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights the credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk as such they pertain to senior obligations of an entity junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation applies when an entity has both senior and subordinate obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations accordingly in the case of junior debt the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition aaaan obligation rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aaan obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only in small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong aan obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbban obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation obligations rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions bban obligation rated bb is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation ban obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated bb but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligors capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation cccan obligation rated ccc is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation ccan obligation rated cc is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment ca c rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment obligations that have payment arrearages allowed by the terms of the documents or obligations of an issuer that is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not experienced a payment default among others the c rating may be assigned to subordinated debt preferred stock or other obligations on which cash payments have been suspended in accordance with the instruments terms or when preferred stock is the subject of a distressed exchange offer whereby some or all of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories nrthis indicates that no rating has been requested that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that standard  poors does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy moodys investors service general longterm rating scale moodys longterm obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit risk of fixedincome obligations with an original maturity of one year or more they address the possibility that a

uncured failure of that entity as such idrs also address relative vulnerability to bankruptcy administrative receivership or similar concepts although the agency recognizes that issuers may also make preemptive and therefore voluntary use of such mechanisms in aggregate idrs provide an ordinal ranking of issuers based on the agencys view of their relative vulnerability to default rather than a

risks associated with such bonds neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds highyield bonds an investment in units of the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks that an investment in highyield highrisk debt obligations or junk obligations may entail including increased credit risks and the risk that the value of the units will decline and may decline precipitously with increases in interest rates the bonds included in the trust may be subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss of income and principal than are investments in loweryielding higherrated bonds and their value may decline precipitously because of increases in interest rates not only because the increases in rates generally decrease values but also because increased rates may indicate a slowdown in the economy and a decrease in the value of assets generally that may adversely affect the credit of issuers of highyield highrisk bonds resulting in a higher incidence of defaults among highyield highrisk bonds a slowdown in the economy or a development adversely affecting an issuers creditworthiness may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings or sell assets at the rate and at the prices respectively that are required to produce sufficient cash flow to meet its interest and principal requirements for an issuer that has outstanding both senior commercial bank debt and subordinated highyield highrisk bonds an increase in interest rates will increase that issuers interest expense insofar as the interest rate on the bank debt is fluctuating however many leveraged issuers enter into interest rate protection agreements to fix or cap the interest rate on a large portion of their bank debt this reduces exposure to increasing rates but reduces the benefit to the issuer of declining rates the sponsor cannot predict future economic policies or their consequences or therefore the course or extent of any similar market fluctuations in the future highyield or junk bonds the generic names for bonds rated below bbb by standard  poors or below baa by moodys are frequently issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development by established companies whose operations or industries are depressed or by highly leveraged companies purchased in leveraged buyout transactions the market for highyield bonds is very specialized and investors in it have been predominantly financial institutions highyield bonds are generally not listed on a national securities exchange trading of highyield bonds therefore takes place primarily in overthecounter markets that consist of groups of dealer firms that are typically major securities firms because the highyield bond market is a dealer market rather than an auction market no single obtainable price for a given bond prevails at any given time prices are determined by negotiation between traders the existence of a liquid trading market for the bonds may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the bonds there can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the bonds that any market for the bonds will be maintained or of the liquidity of the bonds in any markets made not all dealers maintain markets in all highyield bonds therefore since there are fewer traders in these bonds than there are in investment grade bonds the bidoffer spread is usually greater for highyield bonds than it is for investment grade bonds the price at which the bonds may be sold and the value of the trust will be adversely affected if trading markets for the bonds are limited or absent if the rate of redemptions is great the value of the trust may decline to a level that requires liquidation lowerrated bonds tend to offer higher yields than higherrated bonds with the same maturities because the creditworthiness of the issuers of lowerrated bonds may not be as strong as that of other issuers moreover if a bond is recharacterized as equity by the internal revenue service for federal income tax purposes the issuers interest deduction with respect to the bond will be disallowed and this disallowance may adversely affect the issuers credit rating because investors generally perceive that there are greater risks associated with the lowerrated bonds in the trust the yields and prices of these bonds tend to fluctuate more than higherrated bonds with changes in the perceived quality of the credit of their issuers in addition the market value of highyield highrisk bonds may fluctuate more than the market value of higherrated bonds since these bonds tend to reflect shortterm credit development to a greater extent than higherrated bonds lowerrated bonds generally involve greater risks of loss of income and principal than higherrated bonds issuers of lowerrated bonds may possess fewer creditworthiness characteristics than issuers of higherrated bonds and especially in the case of issuers whose obligations or credit standing have recently been downgraded may be subject to claims by debtholders owners of property leased to the issuer or others which if sustained would make it more difficult for the issuers to meet their payment obligations highyield highrisk bonds are also affected by variables such as interest rates inflation rates and real growth in the economy therefore investors should consider carefully the relative risks associated with investment in bonds that carry lower ratings highyield highrisk bonds are generally subordinated obligations the payment of principal and premium if any interest and sinking fund requirements with respect to subordinated obligations of an issuer is subordinated in right of payment to the payment of senior obligations of the issuer senior obligations generally include most if not all significant debt obligations of an issuer whether existing at the time of issuance of subordinated debt or created thereafter upon any distribution of the assets of an issuer with subordinated obligations upon dissolution total or partial liquidation or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the issuer the holders of senior indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in full before holders of subordinated indebtedness will be entitled to receive any payment moreover generally no payment with respect to subordinated indebtedness may be made while there exists a default with respect to any senior indebtedness thus in the event of insolvency holders of senior indebtedness of an issuer generally will recover more ratably than holders of subordinated indebtedness of that issuer obligations that are rated lower than bbb by standard  poors or baa by moodys respectively should be considered speculative as such ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade investors should carefully review the objective of the trust and consider their ability to assume the risks involved before making an investment in the trust consumer discretionary and consumer staples issuers the trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell consumer products the profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends in the past there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail industry particularly the department store segment the continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the industrys ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social conditions to attract and retain capable management and to finance expansion weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry in many sectors of the retail industry competition may be fierce due to market saturation converging consumer tastes and other factors because of these factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries american retailers are now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research costs financial services issuers the trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies within the bank and financial services sector the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis that began to unfold in  continue to manifest in nearly all the subdivisions of the financial services industry subprime mortgage related losses and write downs among investment banks and similar institutions reached significant levels in  the impact of these losses among traditional banks investment banks brokerdealers and insurers has forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation or combination while drastically increasing the credit risk and possibility of default of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles many of the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital in some cases the us government has acted to bail out or provide support to select institutions however the risk of default by such issuers has nonetheless increased substantially while the us department of the treasury federal reserve board and congress have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with financial institutions there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result of these steps banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks are highly dependent on net interest margin bank profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition as initial home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and other factors this income diminished economic conditions in the real estate markets have deteriorated and have had a substantial negative effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in recent years to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act enacted in august  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws many of the regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized and their impact on the business financial condition and prospects of the securities in the trusts portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty the grammleachbliley act financialservices overhaul legislation allows banks securities firms and insurance companies to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors this legislation has resulted in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field legislation to liberalize interstate banking has been signed into law in recent years allowing banks to be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches consolidation is likely to continue the securities and exchange commission the sec and the financial accounting standards board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the bonds in the trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor such reforms could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits banks face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers among other benefits such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to what if any manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  generally prohibits a bank holding company from  acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining federal reserve board frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in the policy statement the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the bonds or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates and competition from new entrants in their fields of business adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the prices of the securities of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including but not limited to interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition o the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophic losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions results of operations and cash flow o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claim settlement practices o the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings o the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are subject and various regulatory and other legal actions o the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products and o the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture zero coupon bonds certain of the bonds in a trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest portfolio administration the trustee is empowered to sell for the purpose of redeeming units tendered by any unitholder and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be available such of the bonds designated by the supervisor as the trustee in its sole discretion may deem necessary the supervisor in designating such bonds will consider a variety of factors including a interest rates b market value and c marketability to the extent that bonds are sold which are current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds if any the overall quality of the bonds remaining in a trusts portfolio will tend to diminish the sponsor is empowered but not obligated to direct the trustee to dispose of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding the sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan except that the sponsor may instruct the trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other action with respect thereto as the sponsor may deem proper if  the issuer is in default with respect to such bond or  in the written opinion of the sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the reasonably foreseeable future any bond so received in exchange or substitution will be held by the trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the trust agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder within five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for underlying bonds the trustee is required to give notice thereof to each unitholder identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor except as stated herein and under trust administrationreplacement bonds in the prospectus regarding the substitution of replacement bonds for failed bonds the acquisition by a trust of any bonds other than the bonds initially deposited is not permitted if any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs and no provision for payment is made therefor within  days the trustee is required to notify the sponsor thereof if the sponsor fails to instruct the trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within  days after notification by the trustee to the sponsor of such default the trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted bond and not be

capital appreciation principal investment strategy the portfolio seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of stocks derived from the sp  dividend aristocrats index as of the close of business on january   the sp  dividend aristocrats index consists of stocks of those companies in the sp  index that have increased their actual dividend payments in each of the last  years invesco capital markets inc is the sponsor of the portfolio the portfolio will consist of companies from the sp  dividend aristocrats index that have attractive dividend coverage an sp capital iq quality rank of b or better and if rated by standard  poors an sp credit rating of bbb or better dividend coverage is calculated by standard  poors investment advisory services llc spias using a proprietary cashflow sectorspecific methodology and is licensed for use by the sponsor and the portfolio beginning with the sp  dividend aristocrats index the sponsor selects the composition of the portfolio by  eliminating companies with a share price below  at time of selection  eliminating companies with an sp credit rating below bbb and companies with an sp capital iq quality ranking below b companies which do not have an sp credit rating may be included  further selecting companies based on factors including market capitalization earnings over the previous  months debttoequity and cash and equivalents and  ranking the remaining companies by spias dividend coverage metric the portfolio is designed as part of a longterm investment strategy the sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio when the current portfolio terminates as a result you may achieve more consistent overall results by following the strategy over several years if subsequent series are available for more information see rights of unitholdersrollover principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in this portfolio the portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o security prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o an issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the level of dividends declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units o the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period o the portfolio does not replicate all of the components of the sp  dividend aristocrats index or its component weightings and the stocks in the portfolio will not change if the index components or their weightings within the index change the performance of the portfolio will not correspond with the sp  dividend aristocrats index for this reason and because the portfolio incurs a sales charge and expenses the portfolio is not intended to replicate the performance of the index o the portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors negative developments in these sectors will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment o we do not actively manage the portfolio except in limited circumstances the portfolio will hold and continue to buy shares of the same securities even if their market value declines fee table the amounts below are estimates of the direct and indirect expenses that you may incur based on a  public offering price per unit

the portfolios offer investors the opportunity to purchase units representing proportionate interests in a portfolio of securities a portfolio may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to

to contracts for the purchase of the securities and an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the trustee in exchange for these contracts the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the portfolios unless otherwise terminated as provided in the trust agreement your portfolio will terminate on the mandatory termination date and any remaining securities will be liquidated or distributed by the trustee within a reasonable time as used in this prospectus the term securities means the securities including contracts to

portfolio i additional securities ii contracts to purchase securities together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or iii cash or a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by your portfolio the aggregate value of the securities will be increased and the fractional undivided interest represented by each unit may be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into your portfolio following the initial date of deposit provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts which will maintain as nearly as practicable the same percentage relationship among the number of shares of each security in the portfolio that existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because your portfolio will pay the associated brokerage or acquisition fees due to round lot requirements in certain foreign securities markets and market value fluctuations your portfolio may not be able to invest in each security on any subsequent date of deposit in the same proportion as existed on the initial date of deposit or immediately prior to the subsequent deposit of securities this could increase the potential for dilution of investments and variances in anticipated income in addition during the initial offering of units it may not be possible to buy a particular security due to regulatory or trading restrictions or corporate actions while such limitations are in effect additional units would be created by purchasing each of the securities in your portfolio that are not subject to those limitations this would also result in the dilution of the investment in any such security not purchased and potential variances in anticipated income purchases and sales of securities by your portfolio may impact the value of the securities this may especially be the case during the initial offering of units upon portfolio termination and in the course of satisfying large unit redemptions each unit of your portfolio initially offered represents an undivided interest in the portfolio at the close of the new york stock exchange on the initial date of deposit the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in your portfolio and the estimated distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in your portfolio represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in your portfolio will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement your

other than the licensors of sp dow jones indices the sponsor does not manage the portfolios you should note that the sponsor applied the selection criteria to the securities for inclusion in your portfolio prior to the initial date of deposit after this time the securities may no longer meet the selection criteria should a security no longer meet the selection criteria we will generally not remove the security from its portfolio in offering the units to the public neither the sponsor nor any brokerdealers are recommending any of the individual securities but rather the entire pool of securities in a portfolio taken as a whole which are represented by the units risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your portfolio you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your portfolio will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your portfolio will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security of the issuer even though your portfolio is supervised you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your portfolio will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund dividend payment risk dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay dividends on a security stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time if dividends received by your portfolio are insufficient to cover expenses redemptions or other portfolio costs it may be necessary for your portfolio to sell securities to cover such expenses redemptions or other costs any such sales may result in capital gains or losses to you see taxation index correlation the dividend sustainability portfolio will consist of stocks from the sp  dividend aristocrats index and the european dividend sustainability portfolio will consist of stocks from the sp europe  dividend aristocrats index your portfolio does not seek to replicate all of the components of the index or its component weightings and the stocks in the portfolio will not change if the index components or their weightings within the index change the performance of your portfolio will not correspond with the index for this reason and because your portfolio incurs a sales charge and expenses foreign stocks because the international dividend sustainability portfolio and european dividend sustainability portfolio invest exclusively in foreign stocks the portfolios may involve additional risks that differ from an investment in domestic stocks these risks include the risk of losses due to future political and economic developments international trade conditions foreign withholding taxes and restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of securities foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or repatriation of currencies the political economic and social structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the us investments in these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts currency devaluations foreign ownership limitations and tax increases it is possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult for a portfolio to vote proxies exercise investor rights and pursue legal remedies with respect to its foreign investments diplomatic and political developments including rapid and adverse political changes social instability regional conflicts terrorism and war could affect the economies industries and securities and currency markets and the value of a portfolios investments in nonus countries no one can predict the impact that these factors could have on a portfolios securities certain stocks may be held in the form of american depositary receipts adrs global depositary receipts gdrs or other similar receipts adrs and gdrs represent receipts for foreign common stock deposited with a custodian which may include the trustee the adrs in your portfolio if any trade in the us in us dollars and are registered with the securities and exchange commission sec gdrs are receipts issued by foreign banks or trust companies or foreign branches of us banks that represent an interest in shares of either a foreign or us corporation these instruments may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the securities into which they may be converted adrs and gdrs generally involve the same types of risks as foreign common stock held directly some adrs and gdrs may experience less liquidity than the underlying common stocks traded in their home market the portfolios may invest in sponsored or unsponsored adrs unlike a sponsored adr where the depositary has an exclusive relationship with the foreign issuer an unsponsored adr may be created by a depositary institution independently and without the cooperation of the foreign issuer consequently information concerning the foreign issuer may be less current or reliable for an unsponsored adr and the price of an unsponsored adr may be more volatile than if it was a sponsored adr depositaries of unsponsored adrs are not required to distribute shareholder communications received from the foreign issuer or to pass through voting rights to its holders the holders of unsponsored adrs generally bear all the costs associated with establishing the unsponsored adr whereas the foreign issuers typically bear certain costs in a sponsored adr the purchase and sale of the foreign securities may occur in foreign securities markets certain of the factors stated above may make it impossible to buy or sell them in a timely manner or may adversely affect the value received on a sale of securities custody of certain of the securities in your portfolio may be maintained by a global custody and clearing institution which has entered into a subcustodian relationship with the trustee in addition round lot trading requirements exist in certain foreign securities markets these round lot trading requirements could cause the proportional composition and diversification of your portfolios securities to vary when the portfolio purchases additional securities or sells securities to satisfy expenses or unit redemptions this could have a material impact on investment performance and portfolio composition brokerage commissions and other fees generally are higher for foreign securities government supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets currency markets trading systems and brokers may be less than in the us the procedures and rules governing foreign transactions and custody holding of the portfolios assets also may involve delays in payment delivery or recovery of money or investments foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as us companies thus there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about most us companies certain foreign securities may be less liquid harder to sell and more volatile than many us securities this means the portfolios may at times be unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices because securities of foreign issuers not listed on a us securities exchange generally pay dividends and trade in foreign currencies the us dollar value of these securities and dividends will vary with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates most foreign currencies have fluctuated widely in value against the us dollar for various economic and political reasons to determine the value of foreign securities or their dividends the trustee will estimate current exchange rates for the relevant currencies based on activity in the various currency exchange markets however these markets can be quite volatile depending on the activity of the large international commercial banks various central banks large multinational corporations speculators and other buyers and sellers of foreign currencies since actual foreign currency transactions may not be instantly reported the exchange rates estimated by the trustee may not reflect the amount your portfolio would receive in us dollars had the trustee sold any particular currency in the market the value of the securities in terms of us dollars and therefore the value of your units will decline if the us dollar decreases in value relative to the value of the currencies in which the securities trade united kingdom the international dividend sustainability portfolio and european dividend sustainability portfolio invest significantly in stocks issued by companies located in the united kingdom uk as a result your portfolio may be affected unfavorably by political developments social instability changes in government policies and other political and economic developments in the uk the uk is a member state of the european union eu the establishment of which has had the effect of eliminating most remaining trade barriers between member nations and has created one of the largest common markets in the world unlike the majority of eu members the uk has not adopted the common eu currency of the euro adoption of the euro has presented strategic challenges to all companies with significant markets or operations in countries utilizing the euro the sponsor cannot predict when or if the uk will convert to the euro or what impact if any the adoption of the euro by the uk would have on any of the securities issued by uk companies in your portfolio canada the international dividend sustainability portfolio invests significantly in stocks issued by companies headquartered or with a significant presence in canada canada is a major producer of commodities including forest products metals agricultural products and energy related products including oil gas and hydroelectricity accordingly changes in the supply and demand of base commodity resources and industrial and precious metals and materials both domestically and internationally can have a significant effect on canadian market performance industry risks the portfolios invest significantly in certain industries any negative impact on these industries will have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries you should understand the risks of these industries before you invest consumer discretionary and consumer staples issuers the portfolios invest significantly in companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products general risks of these companies include the overall state of the economy intense competition and consumer spending trends a decline in the economy which results in a reduction of consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits global factors including political developments imposition of import controls fluctuations in oil prices and changes in exchange rates may adversely affect issuers of consumer products and services competitiveness in the retail industry may require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory track the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns retailers who sell their products over the internet have the potential to access more consumers but may require sophisticated technology to remain competitive changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for and the success of consumer products and services in the marketplace consumer products and services companies may be subject to government regulation affecting their products and operations which may negatively impact performance tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws regulations and litigation health care issuers the european dividend sustainability portfolio invests significantly in health care companies these issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotechnology managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies these companies face substantial government regulation and approval procedures on march   the health care and education reconciliation act of  incorporating the patient protection and affordable care act collectively the act was enacted into law the act continues to have a significant impact on the health care sector through the implementation of a number of reforms in a complex and ongoing process with varying effective dates significant provisions of the act include the introduction of required health care coverage for most americans significant expansion in the number of americans eligible for medicaid modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families the act also provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to preexisting conditions although the entirety of the act will not come into effect until  in the interim health care companies will face continuing and significant changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased costs and changes in the health care market the sponsor is unable to predict the full impact of the act on the securities in your portfolio as illustrated by the act congress may from time to time propose legislative action that will impact the health care sector the proposals may span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which may include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs incentives for competition in the provision of health care services promotion of prepaid health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the health care sector the government could also reduce funding for health care related research drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales product obsolescence termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a product will never come to market the research and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial this process involves lengthy government review with no guarantee of approval these companies may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years if at all the failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a company and its stock the goods and services of health care issuers are also subject to risks of malpractice claims product liability claims or other litigation health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services the ability of the facility to provide required services an increased emphasis on outpatient services confidence in the facility management capabilities competitive forces that may result in price discounting efforts by insurers and government agencies to limit rates expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and termination or restriction of government financial assistance such as medicare medicaid or similar programs legislationlitigation from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in your portfolio or on the tax treatment of your portfolio or of your investment in a portfolio in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities no one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the securities no fdic guarantee an investment in your portfolio is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency public offering general units are offered at the public offering price which consists of the net asset value per unit plus organization costs plus the sales charge the net asset value per unit is the value of the securities cash and other assets in your portfolio reduced by the liabilities of the portfolio divided by the total units outstanding the maximum sales charge equals  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the securities at the time of purchase you pay the initial sales charge at the time you buy units the initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge percentage maximum of  of the public offering price per unit and the sum of the remaining fixed dollar deferred sales charge and the total fixed dollar creation and development fee the initial sales charge will be approximately  of the public offering price per unit depending on the public offering price per unit the deferred sales charge is fixed at  per unit your portfolio pays the deferred sales charge in installments as described in the fee table if any deferred sales charge payment date is not a business day we will charge the payment on the next business day if you purchase units after the initial deferred sales charge payment you will only pay that portion of the payments not yet collected if you redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the total deferred sales charge you will pay any remaining deferred sales charge upon redemption or sale of your units the initial and deferred sales charges are referred to as the transactional sales charge the transactional sales charge does not include the creation and development fee which compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your portfolio and is described under expenses the creation and development fee is fixed at  per unit your portfolio pays the creation and development fee as of the close of the initial offering period as described in the fee table if you redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the creation and development fee you will not pay the creation and development fee upon redemption or sale of your units because the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit the actual charges will exceed the percentages shown in the fee table if the public offering price per unit falls below  and will be less than the percentages shown in the fee table if the public offering price per unit exceeds  in no event will the maximum total sales charge exceed  of the public offering price per unit since the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit your portfolio must charge these amounts per unit regardless of any decrease in net asset value however if the public offering price per unit falls to the extent that the maximum sales charge percentage results in a dollar amount that is less than the combined fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee your initial sales charge will be a credit equal to the amount by which these fixed dollar charges exceed your sales charge at the time you buy units in such a situation the value of securities per unit would exceed the public offering price per unit by the amount of the initial sales charge credit and the value of those securities will fluctuate which could result in a benefit or detriment to unitholders that purchase units at that price the initial sales charge credit is paid by the sponsor and is not paid by your portfolio the fee table shows the sales charge calculation at a  public offering price per unit and the following examples illustrate the sales charge at prices below and above  if the public offering price per unit fell to  the maximum sales charge would be   of the public offering price per unit which consists of an initial sales charge of  a deferred sales charge of  and a creation and development fee of  if the public offering price per unit rose to  the maximum sales charge would be   of the public offering price per unit consisting of an initial sales charge of  a deferred sales charge of  and the creation and development fee of  the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase is  units  units for retirement accounts but may vary by selling firm certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases reducing your sales charge the sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to reduce the sales charge that you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert the sponsor of any discount when you purchase units before you purchase units you must also inform your financial professional of your qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a reduced sales charge as further described in this section purchases executed on the same day by a single person at the same brokerdealer may be combined for sales charge discount calculation purposes secondary market purchases are excluded for purposes of sales charge discount calculations since the deferred sales charges and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit your portfolio must charge these amounts per unit regardless of any discounts however if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales charge is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charges and creation and development fee you will receive a credit equal to the difference between your total sales charge and these fixed dollar charges at the time you buy units large quantity purchases you can reduce your sales charge by increasing the size of your investment based upon the aggregate dollar amount of units purchased by a unitholder in the initial offering period the following table shows both the corresponding sales charge and the concession or agency commission allowed to brokerdealers and other selling agents

of units will vary from the amounts stated under essential information in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying securities in the portfolios the initial price of the securities

including circumstances under which the trustee determines that a securitys market price is not accurate a portfolio security is valued at its fair value as determined under procedures established by the trustee or an independent pricing service used by the trustee in these cases a portfolios net asset value will reflect certain portfolio securities fair value rather than their market price with

the related record date estimated distributions the estimated initial distribution and estimated net annual income per unit may be shown under essential information generally the estimate of the income a portfolio may receive is based on the most recent ordinary quarterly dividends declared by an issuer the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign issuers or scheduled income payments in all cases accounting for any applicable foreign withholding taxes in certain cases estimated net annual income may also be based upon several recently declared dividends of an issuer however common stocks do not assure dividend payments and therefore the amount of future dividend income to your portfolio is uncertain the actual net annual distributions may decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in a portfolio will be sold to pay for the organization costs deferred sales charge and creation and development fee securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during a portfolios life dividend and income conventions for certain companies andor certain countries differ from those typically used in the united states and in certain instances dividendsincome paid or declared over several years or other periods may be used to estimate annual distributions the actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in a portfolios fees and expenses in actual income received by a portfolio currency fluctuations and with changes in a portfolio such as the acquisition call maturity or sale of securities due to these and various other factors actual income received by a portfolio will most likely differ from the most recent dividends or scheduled income payments

prospectus tax laws and interpretations are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect and this summary does not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example this summary generally does not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer a taxexempt entity financial institution person who marks to market their units or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your alternative minimum state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your portfolio additional information related to taxes is contained in the information supplement as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor portfolio status your portfolio intends to elect and to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if your portfolio qualifies under the tax law as a regulated investment company and distributes its income consistently with such qualification the portfolio generally will not pay federal income taxes but there is no assurance that the distributions made by your portfolio will eliminate all taxes for every year at the level of your portfolio distributions portfolio distributions are generally taxable to you after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement reporting your portfolios distributions including the amounts of ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your tax rate for ordinary income however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from your portfolio may be taxed under current law at the capital gains tax rates certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by your portfolio from certain corporations may be reported by the portfolio as being eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate unitholders provided certain holding period requirements are met income from the portfolio may also be subject to a  medicare tax imposed generally on investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals in addition your portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the unitholders basis in the units and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units the tax status of your distributions from your portfolio is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your portfolio that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat certain distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year a distribution paid by your portfolio reduces the portfolios net asset value per unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution accordingly a distribution paid shortly after a purchase of units by a unitholder would represent in substance a partial return of capital however it would be subject to income taxes sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your initial tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain under current law is generally  taxpayers whose marginal ordinary income bracket is below  are generally not subject to tax on their net capital gains net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your portfolio and sell your units at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code of  as amended treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations in certain circumstances ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment company such as your portfolio may be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the portfolio itself each portfolio will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as qualified dividend income which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates in kind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an in kind distribution of portfolio securities when you redeem your units in general this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will recognize gain or loss based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the internal revenue service could however assert that a loss is not currently deductible rollovers and exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your portfolio rolled over into a future trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and in general any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that units disposed of are replaced including through reinvestment of dividends within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after disposition of units or to the extent that the unitholder during such period acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities in such a case the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss deductibility of portfolio expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your portfolio will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these portfolio expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income such deductions may be subject to limitation for taxpayers whose income exceeds certain levels foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions to you from your portfolio will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which the portfolio reports as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below you may be eligible under certain income tax treaties for a reduction in withholding rates however distributions received by a foreign investor from a portfolio that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that your portfolio makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met the foreign account

to the rights of creditors bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company this means that common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a companys board of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders if a company issues additional debt securities or preferred stock the owners of these securities will have a claim against the companys assets before common stockholders if the company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued first as a result the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay dividends on its common stock foreign stocks because certain portfolios invest in foreign stocks these portfolios involve additional risks that differ from an investment in domestic stocks investments in foreign securities may involve a greater degree of risk than those in domestic securities there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies in the form of reports and ratings similar to those that are published about issuers in the united states also foreign issuers are generally not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting requirements comparable to those applicable to united states issuers with respect to certain foreign countries there is the possibility of adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations expropriation nationalization or confiscatory taxation limitations on the removal of funds or other assets of a portfolio political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect united states investments in those countries moreover industrial foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the united states economy in terms of growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position foreign securities markets are generally not as developed or efficient as those in the united states while growing in volume they usually have substantially less volume than the new york stock exchange and securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable united states issuers fixed commissions on foreign exchanges are generally higher than negotiated commissions on united states exchanges there is generally less government supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and listed issuers than in the united states foreign currencies certain portfolios also involve the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of the stocks for example if a foreign stock rose  in price but the us dollar gained  against the related foreign currency a us investors return would be reduced to about  this is because the foreign currency would buy fewer dollars or conversely a dollar would buy more of the foreign currency many foreign currencies have fluctuated widely against the us dollar for a variety of reasons such as supply and demand of the currency investor perceptions of world or country economies political instability currency speculation by institutional investors changes in government policies buying and selling of currencies by central banks of countries trade balances and changes in interest rates a portfolios foreign currency transactions will be conducted with foreign exchange dealers acting as principals on a spot ie cash buying basis these dealers realize a profit based on the difference between the price at which they buy the currency bid price and the price at which they sell the currency offer price the trustee will estimate the currency exchange rates based on current activity in the related currency exchange markets however due to the volatility of the markets and other factors the estimated rates may not be indicative of the rate a portfolio might obtain had the trustee sold the currency in the market at that time consumer discretionary and consumer staples issuers the portfolios may invest significantly in issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products the profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends in the past there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail industry particularly the department store segment the continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the industrys ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social conditions to attract and retain capable management and to finance expansion weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry in many sectors of the retail industry competition may be fierce due to market saturation converging consumer tastes and other factors because of these factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries american retailers are now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research costs liquidity whether or not the stocks in a portfolio are listed on a stock exchange the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an overthecounter market as a result the existence of a liquid trading market could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks we cannot guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be liquid the value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or absent additional units the sponsor may create additional units of a portfolio by depositing into the portfolio additional stocks or cash with instructions to purchase additional stocks a deposit could result in a dilution of your investment and anticipated income because of fluctuations in the price of the stocks between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the stocks and because a portfolio will pay brokerage or acquisition fees voting only the trustee may sell or vote the stocks in a portfolio while you may sell or redeem your units you may not sell or vote the stocks in your portfolio the sponsor will instruct the trustee how to vote the stocks the trustee will vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by other shareholders if the sponsor fails to provide instructions sponsor information invesco capital markets inc is the

disposition of portfolio units the discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax consequences of the purchase ownership or disposition of portfolio units as well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state locality nonus country or other taxing jurisdiction this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your portfolio the portfolios intend to elect and to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and to comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it will not pay federal income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its unitholders to qualify for the favorable us federal income tax treatment generally accorded to regulated investment companies a portfolio must among other things a derive in each taxable year at least  of its gross income from dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and net income from qualified publicly traded partnerships b diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year i at least  of the market value of the portfolios assets is represented by cash and cash items including receivables us government securities the securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities with such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than  of the value of the portfolios total assets and not greater than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities other than us government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies of any one issuer or two or more issuers which the portfolio controls by owning  or more of the issuers outstanding voting securities and which are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or the securities of qualified publicly traded partnerships and c distribute at least  of its investment company taxable income which includes among other items dividends interest and net shortterm capital gains in excess of net longterm capital losses but excludes net capital gain if any and at least  of its net taxexempt interest income if any each taxable year as a regulated investment company your portfolio generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on its investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the code but without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and net capital gain the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss if any that it distributes to unitholders your portfolio intends to distribute to its unitholders at least annually substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain if a portfolio retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income it will generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained in addition amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible  excise tax unless generally a portfolio distributes during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of  at least  of its ordinary income not taking into account any capital gains or losses for the calendar year  at least  of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses adjusted for certain ordinary losses for the oneyear period ending october  of the calendar year and  any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed or taxed during those years to prevent application of the excise tax your portfolio intends to make its distributions in accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement further if a portfolio retains any net capital gain the portfolio may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to unitholders who if subject to federal income tax on longterm capital gains i will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain their share of such undistributed amount and ii will be entitled to credit their proportionate share of the tax paid by the portfolio against their federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities a distribution will be treated as paid on december  of the current calendar year if it is declared by a portfolio in october november or december with a record date in such a month and paid by the portfolio during january of the following calendar year these distributions will be taxable to unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received if a portfolio failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed to satisfy the  distribution requirement in any taxable year the portfolio would be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income even if such income were distributed to its unitholders and all distributions out of earnings and profits would be taxable to unitholders as ordinary dividend income there is no assurance that the distributions from your portfolio will be sufficient to eliminate all taxes in all years a portfolio may make taxable distributions to you even during periods in which the share price has declined your portfolio may be required to withhold as backup withholding federal income tax at the backup withholding rate on all taxable distributions payable to you if you fail to provide your correct taxpayer identification number or to make required certifications or if the irs indicates that you are subject to backup withholding backup withholding is not an additional tax any amounts withheld may be credited against your federal income tax liability if you provide the required information or certification if a portfolio is treated as holding directly or indirectly  percent or more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation and all us shareholders collectively own more than  percent of the vote or value of the stock of such corporation the foreign corporation may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation a cfc for us federal income tax purposes in such circumstances a portfolio will be required to include certain types of passive income and certain other types of income relating to insurance sales and services with related parties and oil related income in the portfolios taxable income whether or not such income is distributed if a portfolio holds an equity interest in any passive foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the portfolio could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its unitholders a portfolio will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes a portfolio may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case a portfolio would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election a portfolio might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax described above dividends paid by pfics will not be treated as qualified dividend income portfolio termination a portfolio may be liquidated at any time by consent of unitholders representing   of the units of such portfolio then outstanding or by the trustee when the value of the securities owned by a portfolio as shown by any evaluation is less than   if the value of a portfolio has exceeded  a portfolio will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a sufficient number of units of such portfolio not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the sponsor so that the net worth of such portfolio would be reduced to less than  of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in such portfolio if a portfolio is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the sponsor the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser the trust agreement will terminate upon the sale or other disposition of the last security held thereunder but in no event will it continue beyond the mandatory termination date commencing during the period beginning nine business days prior to and no later than the mandatory termination date securities will begin to be sold in connection with the termination of the portfolios the sponsor will determine the manner timing and execution of the sales of the securities the sponsor shall direct the liquidation of the securities in such manner as to effectuate orderly sales and a minimal market impact in the event the sponsor does not so direct the securities shall be sold within a reasonable period and in such manner as the trustee in its sole discretion shall determine unitholders will receive a cash distribution from the sale of the remaining securities within a reasonable time following the mandatory termination date the trustee will deduct from the funds of the appropriate portfolio any accrued costs expenses advances or indemnities provided by the trust agreement including estimated compensation of the trustee costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other governmental charges any sale of securities in a portfolio upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time the trustee will then distribute to each unitholder of each portfolio his pro rata share of the balance of the income and capital accounts of such portfolio the sponsor may but is not obligated to offer for sale units of a subsequent series of the portfolios there is however no assurance that units of any new series of the portfolios will be offered for sale at that time or if offered that there will be sufficient units available for sale to meet the requests of any or all unitholders within  days of the final distribution unitholders will be furnished a final distribution statement of the amount distributable at such time as the trustee in its sole discretion will determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary it will make distribution thereof to unitholders in the same manner uemssup contents of registration

unit trusts municipal series  monthly distributions estimated current return  estimated long term return  estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each year divided by the unit price estimated long term return shows the estimated return over the estimated life of your trust these estimates are as of the opening of business on the date of deposit and will vary thereafter we base this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life this estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses we derive the average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bonds yield by its value and estimated life unlike estimated current return estimated long term return accounts for maturities discounts and premiums of the bonds these estimates show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns no return calculation can predict your actual return your actual return may vary from these estimates prospectus part i april   this prospectus contains

not approved or disapproved of the trust units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus any contrary representation is a criminal offense invesco investment objective the trust seeks to provide federal taxexempt income and to preserve capital principal investment strategy the trust invests in a portfolio of municipal bonds issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the united states and political subdivisions and authorities thereof the interest on which is in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities excludable from gross income for federal personal income tax purposes under existing law insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in the trust has been previously obtained from bond insurance companies in selecting bonds for the trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others o the bonds must be insured with a standard  poors rating of at least a or a moodys investors service inc rating of at least a or if not rated as of the date of deposit are insured by a bond insurer with at least a a rating by standard  poors or at least a a rating by moodys investors service inc o the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity o the current income provided by the bonds o the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and o the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk the portfolio generally consists of bonds maturing approximately  to  years from the date of deposit following the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced and the trust could continue to hold such bond see trust administrationportfolio administration in prospectus part ii principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in the trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o bond prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o the value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future o a bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest andor principal payments in the future o the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o a bond issuer might prepay or call a bond before its stated maturity if this happens the trust will distribute the principal to you but future interest distributions will fall a bonds call price could be less than the price the trust paid for the bond if enough bonds are called the trust could terminate earlier than expected o the trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer this makes the trust less diversified and subject to greater risk than a more diversified portfolio the types of bonds in the portfolio are listed under the bonds in prospectus part ii o we do not actively manage the trusts portfolio except in limited

approximately  of the bonds will mature each year beginning in approximately the fifth year of the trust entitling each unitholder to a return of principal this return of principal may offer unitholders the opportunity to respond to changing economic conditions and to specific financial needs that may arise during the periods of the scheduled maturities however the flexibility provided by the return of principal may also eliminate a unitholders ability to reinvest at a rate as high as the yield on the bonds which matured each unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the principal and net income of a trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each unit will increase although the actual interest in the trust will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed by unitholders or until the termination of the trust agreement objectives and bond selection the trusts seek to preserve capital and to provide federal taxexempt income and in the case of most state trusts federal and state taxexempt income taxation the trusts invest in portfolios

counsel to the issuing authorities excludable from gross income for federal and for state trusts state personal income tax purposes under existing law an imit laddered series has additional objectives of providing protection against changes in interest rates and investment flexibility through an investment in a laddered portfolio of interestbearing obligations with maturities ranging from approximately  to  years in which roughly  of the bonds mature every five years beginning in approximately the tenth year of the trust a state intermediate laddered maturity trust has additional

when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in each insured trust has been obtained from municipal bond insurance companies for information relating to insurance on the bonds see insurance on the bonds in the insured trusts in selecting bonds for a trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others a as of the date of deposit the bonds are rated by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization in the category described in prospectus part i for the particular trust or if not rated have credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by such trust in the opinion of the sponsor b the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity c the current income provided by the bonds d the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and e the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires elimination of a bond from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see trust administrationportfolio administration the bonds your trust invests in municipal bonds states municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds the sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by type of bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment the types of bonds and percentages they represent in your portfolio are listed in prospectus part i these bonds are also described in greater detail in the information supplement general obligation bonds and revenue bonds general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities competition government regulation and rate approvals overhead expenses and the cost of fuels single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services these issuers face problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases population declines difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and nogrowth zoning ordinances these issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also included in the portfolio and notes thereto in prospectus part i this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to your trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the sponsor delivers the bond to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them in order to acquire certain bonds it may be necessary for the sponsor or trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on the date of deposit this cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the first settlement date the trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from interest payments on the related bonds also since interest on any when as and if issued bonds does not begin accruing as taxexempt interest income to the benefit of unitholders until the date of delivery the trustee may reduce its fee and pay trust expenses in order to maintain or approach the same estimated net annual interest income during the first year of the trusts operations as described under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i municipal bond risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment current economic conditions the markets for credit instruments including corporate bonds and municipal securities have experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility since the latter half of  the current economic environment has made conditions difficult for virtually all industries and companies to operate in an efficient manner general market uncertainty and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety of debt securities these conditions resulted and in many cases continue to result in greater volatility less liquidity widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of uncertain value these market conditions may make valuation of some of the trusts bonds uncertain andor result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in its holdings market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early the first date that the issuer can call each bond is listed in the portfolio in prospectus part i along with the price the issuer would have to pay some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events the call provisions are described in general terms in the redemption feature column of the portfolio section in prospectus part i and the notes thereto additional discussion of call provisions appears in the information supplement bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described under the bonds reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could lose income andor principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond both default in making their payment obligations liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust for example future legislation could reduce tax rates impose a flat tax exempt all investment income from tax or change the tax status of the bonds litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds state risk factors your trust may invest significantly in taxexempt municipal bonds of issuers from a particular state the financial condition of a state may be affected by various national economic social and environmental policies and conditions additionally limitations imposed by constitutional amendments legislative measures or voter initiatives on a state and its local governments concerning taxes bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenuegenerating capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations the economic vitality of a state and its various regions and therefore the ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds are affected by numerous factors such as natural disasters complications with exports and industry deregulation a state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns the estimated current return and the estimated longterm return as of the date of deposit are set forth on the cover of the prospectus part i estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the trust and with the principal prepayment default if any redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated dates and amounts of principal returned on the bonds while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price public offering general units are offered at the public offering price during the initial offering period the public offering price is based on the aggregate offering price of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account including cash to pay organization costs and accrued interest if any organization costs are not included in the public offering price per unit for purposes of calculating the sales charge if you purchase units during the initial offering period of a trust with a deferred sales charge your sales charge will consist of i an initial sales charge paid upon the purchase of your units and ii the remaining deferred sales charge which consists of a fixed dollar amount per unit paid in installments on specified deferred sales charge payment dates in no event will your combined initial sales charge and deferred sales charge exceed the maximum percentage sales charge for the applicable trust as set forth above for more details including the specific amount and method of calculation of the initial and deferred sales charge for those trusts which offer a deferred sales charge see the fee table in prospectus part i of the applicable trust after the initial public offering period the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase in the primary and secondary market is one unit certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases the maximum initial offering period sales charges are as follows initial offering period sales charge as percent of  public offering offering price

charges in the above table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market public offering price per unit for example the maximum secondary market sales charge for a trust with an eltr life of  but less than  years would be  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate bid price of the bonds if you purchase units in the secondary market of a trust with a deferred sales charge your maximum sales charge will be based on the remaining eltr life of the trust as described above and will consist of an initial sales charge and the remaining deferred sales charge if any if the secondary market units are purchased prior to the final deferred sales charge payment date the initial sales charge which you pay at the time of purchase is the difference between the secondary market sales charge based on the eltr life listed above and the maximum remaining deferred sales charge if you purchase units after the last deferred sales charge payment has been assessed your maximum sales charge will consist of the one time initial sales charge based on the eltr life reducing your sales charge the sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to reduce the sales charge that you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert the sponsor of any discount when you purchase units before you purchase units you must also inform your brokerdealer of your qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a reduced sales charge you may not combine discounts for trusts with a deferred sales charge these charges are fixed dollar amounts per unit and your trust must charge these amounts per unit regardless of any discounts however if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales charge is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charges you will receive a credit equal to the difference between your total sales charge and these fixed dollar charges at the time you buy units large quantity purchases you can reduce your sales charge by increasing the size of your investment if you purchase the amount of units shown in the table below during the initial offering period your sales charge will be as

purposes of calculating the applicable quantity discount level the reduced sales charge levels will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing units for a single trust estate including multiple trusts created under a single estate or fiduciary account to be eligible for aggregation as described in this paragraph all purchases must be made on the same day through a single

called fee accounts for additional information on these purchases units may be purchased in the initial offering period at the public offering price less the maximum applicable concession the sponsor typically allows to brokers and dealers either nonunderwriter or underwriter concession whichever is greater for purchases by investors who purchase units through registered investment advisers certified financial planners and registered brokerdealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services financial planning investment advisory or asset management services or

participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts unit price the public offering price of units will vary from the amounts stated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds the price of units as of the opening of business on the date of deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales charge and organization costs to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding this price determination was made on the basis of an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the evaluator during the initial offering period the evaluator will value the bonds as of the evaluation time on days the new york stock exchange is open for business and will adjust the public offering price of units accordingly the evaluation time is the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for trading or earlier on days where the bond market association recommends an early bond market close provided however on the date of deposit the evaluation time will be the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec becomes effective if later the secondary market public offering price per unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding for secondary market purposes this computation will be made by the evaluator as of the evaluation time for each day on which any unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary the offering price of bonds may be expected to range approximately from  to  more than the bid price the public offering price per unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the evaluation time on each business day orders received by the sponsor prior to the evaluation time and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the evaluation time that are properly transmitted to the sponsor by the time designated by the sponsor are priced based on the date of receipt orders received by the sponsor after the evaluation time and orders received by authorized financial professionals after the evaluation time or orders received by such persons that are not transmitted to the sponsor until after the time designated by the sponsor are priced based on the date of the next determined public offering price per unit provided they are received timely by the sponsor on such date it is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit orders received by them to the sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner the aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices or offering prices as is appropriate a on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the trusts b if these prices are not available on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds c by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation quoting or appraising comparable bonds or d by any combination of the above market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  organization costs during the initial offering period part of the public offering price represents an amount of cash deposited to pay the estimated costs incurred in establishing your trust these costs include the costs of preparing documents relating to the trust such as the registration statement prospectus trust agreement and legal documents federal and state registration fees the initial fees and expenses of the trustee and the initial audit your trust will reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or after six months if earlier the value of your units will decline when the trust deducts these costs from the trust assets accrued interest accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid by the bonds semiannually although each trust accrues interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling after the first settlement date the proportionate share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units you will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on your units on the next distribution date in an effort to reduce the accrued interest which would have to be paid by unitholders the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the accrued interest added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account after the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by a trust and distributed to unitholders if you sell or redeem all or a portion of your units you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of your units unit distribution units will be distributed to the public by underwriters brokerdealers and others

mature from time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested in the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been purchased under a contract failed bonds the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other bonds replacement bonds to make up the original portfolio of a trust replacement bonds must be purchased within  days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and the purchase price exclusive of accrued interest may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the failed bonds the replacement bonds must be substantially identical to the failed bonds in terms of i the exemption from federal and state taxation ii maturity iii yield to maturity and current return iv standard  poors or moodys ratings and v insurance in an insured trust the trustee shall notify all unitholders of a trust within five days after the acquisition of a replacement bond and shall make a pro rata distribution of the amount if any by which the cost of the failed bond exceeded the cost of the replacement bond plus accrued interest if failed bonds are not replaced the sponsor will refund the sales charge attributable to the failed bonds to all unitholders of the trust and distribute the principal and accrued interest at the coupon rate of the failed bonds to the date of removal from the trust attributable to the failed bonds within  days after removal all interest paid to a unitholder which accrued after the expected date of settlement for units will be paid by the sponsor and accordingly will not be treated as taxexempt income if failed bonds are not replaced the estimated net annual interest income per unit would be reduced and the estimated current return and estimated longterm return might be lowered unitholders may not be able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in excess of the yield of the failed bonds amendment of trust agreement the sponsor and the trustee may amend the trust agreement without the consent of unitholders to correct any provision which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect the interest of the unitholders as determined in good faith by the sponsor and the trustee or to maintain the tax status of a trust the trust agreement may not be amended to increase the number of units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition to or in substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in a trust except for the substitution of certain refunding bonds the trustee will notify unitholders of any amendment termination of trust agreement a trust will terminate upon the redemption sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the trust a trust may also be terminated at any time by consent of unitholders of  of the units then outstanding or by the trustee when the value of the trust is less than  of the original principal amount of bonds a trust will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the underwriters including the sponsor so that the net worth of such trust would be reduced to less than  of the initial principal amount of such trust if a trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the underwriter the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser the trustee will notify each unitholder of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any remaining bonds the sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time for this reason among others the amount realized by a unitholder upon termination may be less than the principal amount of bonds per unit or value at the time of purchase the trustee will distribute to each unitholder his share of the balance of the interest and principal accounts after deduction of costs expenses or indemnities the unitholder will receive a final distribution statement with this distribution when the trustee in its sole discretion determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary it will distribute these amounts to unitholders the information supplement contains further information regarding termination of a trust see additional information limitation on liabilities the sponsor supervisor evaluator and trustee shall be under no liability to unitholders for taking any action or for refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the trust agreement or for errors in judgment but shall be liable only for their own willful misfeasance bad faith or gross negligence negligence in the case of the trustee in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder the trustee shall not be liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any of the bonds in the event of the failure of the sponsor to act under the trust agreement the trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any action taken by it in good faith under the trust agreement the trustee is not liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds on it as trustee under the trust agreement or on a trust which the trustee may be required to pay under any present or future law of the united states of america or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction in addition the trust agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the trustee the trustee and sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof determinations by the evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information available to it provided however that the evaluator shall be under no liability to the trustee sponsor or unitholders for errors in judgment federal tax status this is a general discussion of certain federal income tax consequences arising from the purchase ownership and disposition of units of a trust that intends to qualify as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes the summary is limited to investors who hold the units as capital assets generally property held for investment within the meaning of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code unitholders should consult their tax advisers in determining the federal state local and any other tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of units tax status of the trusts the trusts have elected to qualify and intend to qualify annually as regulated investment companies under subchapter m of the code to qualify as a regulated investment company a trust must distribute to its unitholders at least  of its investment company taxable income which includes among other items dividends taxable interest if any and the excess of net shortterm capital gains over net longterm capital losses and  of its taxexempt interest income and meet certain diversification of assets source of income and other requirements by meeting these requirements a trust generally will not be subject to federal income tax on investment company taxable income and on net capital gains the excess of net longterm capital gains over net shortterm capital losses reported by a trust as capital gain dividends distributed to unitholders a trust can also avoid an annual nondeductible  excise tax if each calendar year it distributes substantially all of its ordinary income short and longterm capital gain and any previously undistributed and untaxed amounts if for any taxable year a trust did not qualify as a regulated investment company all of its taxable income would be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to unitholders and any distributions would be taxable to the unitholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of such trusts current or accumulated earnings and profits such distributions generally would be eligible for the dividends received deduction in the case of corporate unitholders and the lower federal income tax rate currently applicable to qualifying dividend income for individual unitholders provided certain holding period requirements were satisfied by the trust and the respective unitholders the trusts may be subject to state or local tax in jurisdictions in which the trusts are organized or may be deemed to be doing business distributions each trust intends to make sufficient distributions of investment company taxable income if any capital gains if any and exemptinterest dividends each year in order to qualify as a regulated investment company and to avoid any trustlevel federal income or excise taxes each trust intends to be eligible to distribute exemptinterest dividends to unitholders by holding a sufficient amount of its assets in bonds generating interest that is exempt from federal income taxation under section  of the code such exemptinterest dividends are not subject to regular federal income tax but may be subject to alternative minimum tax distributions of investment company taxable income including net shortterm capital gains if any are taxable to unitholders as ordinary income and generally will not qualify for treatment as qualified dividend income currently taxed at a maximum rate of  for individual unitholders or for the dividendsreceived deduction for corporate unitholders any income from your trust that you must take into account for federal tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any net capital gains of a trust net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss if any realized and distributed by such trust and reported as capital gain dividends are taxable to unitholders as longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of  without regard to the length of time the unitholder may have held his or her units in the trust capital gain dividends are not eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction for corporate unitholders in determining the amount of capital gains to be distributed by a trust any capital loss carry over from a prior year will be taken into account in determining the amount of net longterm capital gain taxable distributions are taxable to investors whether received in cash or reinvested in additional units when the bonds owned by the trusts were issued special bond counsel issued opinions that the interest on the bonds is not subject to regular federal income tax except in the limited circumstances referred to below payments that a trust receives on a bank letter of credit guarantee or insurance policy because the bond issuer has defaulted should be treated as payments on the bond namely as payments of principal or interest that are not subject to regular federal income tax or taxable market discount or capital gain the taxexempt status of the interest depends on compliance by the issuer and others with ongoing requirements and the opinions of bond counsel assume that these requirements will be met however there is no guarantee that the issuers and other users will comply with these requirements a trust may have to accrue and distribute income not yet received if it invests in bonds issued at a discount a trust may be required to sell bonds that it otherwise would have continued to hold in order to generate sufficient cash to make this distribution the interest on some private activity bonds is a preference item included in alternative minimum taxable income each year the trusts will give to unitholders a report showing the percentage of the trusts income that is a preference item in addition alternative minimum taxable income of a corporate unitholder is increased by part of the excess of its adjusted current earnings an alternative measure of income that includes interest on all tax exempt securities over the amount otherwise determined to be alternative minimum taxable income therefore the exemptinterest dividends may cause a unitholder to have to pay the federal alternative minimum tax or may increase the amount of that tax payable by a unitholder already subject to federal alternative minimum tax the trusts may own bonds originally issued at a discount in general original issue discount is the difference between the price at which a bond was issued and its stated redemption price at maturity original issue discount on taxexempt bonds accrues as taxexempt interest over the life of the bond a trusts adjusted tax basis for a bond issued with original issue discount will include original issue discount accrued during the period it held the bond a trust may also pay a premium when it buys a bond even a bond issued with original issue discount a trust may be required to amortize the premium over the term of the bond and reduce its basis for the bond even though it does not get any deduction for the amortization therefore sometimes the trust may have a taxable gain when it sells a bond for an amount equal to or less than its original tax basis unitholders may receive ordinary income dividends from a trust if the trust sells or redeems bonds that were acquired at a market discount or sells bonds at a short term capital gain in general the internal revenue service irs will treat bonds as market discount bonds when the cost of the bond plus any original issue discount that has not yet accrued is less than the amount due to be paid at the maturity of the bond the irs generally taxes all or a portion of the gain on the sale of a market discount bond as ordinary income when the bond is sold redeemed or paid the portion of the gain taxed by the irs as ordinary income is equal to the portion of the market discount that has accrued since the seller purchased the bond some of the bonds held by the trusts may lose their taxexempt status while they are owned by a substantial user of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of those bonds or by persons related to a substantial user a substantial user is a person whose gross revenue derived with respect to the facilities financed by the bonds is more than  of the total revenue derived by all users of those facilities or who occupies more than  of the usable area of the facilities or for whom the facilities or a part thereof were specifically constructed reconstructed or acquired related persons are certain related individuals affiliated corporations partners and partnerships this rule would not change the taxexempt status of interest on bonds held by other persons these rules may apply to a unitholder who receives exemptinterest dividends attributable to interest on bonds that financed facilities for which such unitholder or a related person is a substantial user individuals must take exemptinterest dividends into consideration in computing the portion if any of social security benefits that will be included in their gross income and subject to federal income tax if a trust declares dividends in october november or december that are payable to unitholders of record on a date during those months unitholders must take the dividends into account for tax purposes in the current year if the dividend is paid either in the current year or in january of the following year ordinary exemptinterest and capital gain dividends will be taxable as described above whether received in cash or reinvested in additional units if a trust invests in securities of foreign issuers it may be subject to withholding and other similar income taxes imposed by a foreign country dividends and distributions may also be subject to state and local taxes investors should carefully consider the tax implications of buying units prior to a distribution by a trust the price of units purchased at that time includes the amount of the forthcoming distributions distributions by a trust reduce the net asset value of such trusts units and if a distribution reduces the net asset value below a unitholders cost basis such distribution nevertheless could be taxable to the unitholder as ordinary income or capital gain as described above even though from an investment standpoint it may constitute a partial return of capital sale or redemption of units upon the taxable disposition including a sale or redemption of units of a trust a unitholder may realize a gain or loss depending upon such unitholders adjusted tax basis in the units and the amount of sale or redemption proceeds such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the units are capital assets in the unitholders hands and will be longterm or shortterm generally depending upon the unitholders holding period for the units noncorporate unitholders are currently subject to tax at a maximum federal rate of  on capital gains resulting from the disposition of units held for more than  months zero if the taxpayer is and would be after accounting for such gains subject to the federal  or  tax bracket for ordinary income however a loss realized by a unitholder on the disposition of units with respect to which capital gains dividends have been paid will to the extent of such capital gain dividends also be treated as longterm capital loss if such shares have been held by the unitholder for six months or less further a loss realized on a disposition will be disallowed to the extent the units disposed of are replaced whether by reinvestment of distributions or otherwise within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after the units are disposed of in such a case the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss capital losses in any year are deductible only to the extent of capital gains plus in the case of a noncorporate taxpayer  of ordinary income  for married individuals filing separately backup withholding the trusts generally must withhold and pay over to the us treasury as backup withholding at a current rate of  of the taxable dividends and other distributions paid to any individual unitholder who either does not supply its taxpayer identification number has not reported all of its dividends and interest income or does not certify to a trust that he or she is not subject to withholding the social security number of an individual is his or her taxpayer identification number backup withholding also may be required for a unitholder upon notification of the trust by the irs backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld may be credited against a unitholders ultimate federal income tax liability if proper documentation is provided foreign withholding unitholders who are not us persons should consult their tax adviser regarding the us and foreign tax consequences of ownership of units including the possibility that such a unitholder may be subject to a us withholding tax at a rate of  or at a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty on amounts received from a trust information statements after the end of each fiscal year for a trust the trustee will furnish to each unitholder a statement containing information regarding the amount of exemptinterest dividends ordinary dividends and capital gain dividends distributed to such unitholder during the fiscal year investors should consult their tax advisers prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisers concerning the federal state local foreign and any other tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of units based on their individual circumstances additional tax information is contained in the information supplement expenses general the trustee will periodically deduct from the interest account and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the principal account amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trusts provided that organization costs and deferred sales charges if any are generally paid out of cash deposited in the principal account the trustee

understanding of the characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds the types of bonds included in each trust are described under portfolio in the related prospectus part i neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds general obligation bonds and revenue bonds certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest however the taxing power of any governmental entity may be limited by provisions of state constitutions or laws and an entitys credit will depend on many factors some such factors are the entitys tax base the extent to which the entity relies on federal or state aid and other factors which are beyond the entitys control revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in a trust both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors housing bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from mortgage loans certain of such housing bonds may be fha insured multifamily housing revenue bonds are payable primarily from mortgage loans to housing projects for low to moderate income families single family mortgage revenue bonds are issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income the ability of housing issuers to make debt service payments on their obligations may be affected by various economic and noneconomic factors such factors include occupancy levels adequate rental income in multifamily projects the rate of default on mortgage loans underlying single family issuers and the ability of mortgage insurers to pay claims mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds in each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations certain issuers of housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds in connection with the housing bonds held by a trust the sponsor at the date of deposit is not aware that any of the respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering the redemption of such bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates health care bonds certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other health care facilities efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance the funding of medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs government regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs it also may be necessary for a hospital or other health care facility to incur substantial capital expenditures or increased operating expenses to effect changes in its facilities equipment personnel and services hospitals and other health care facilities are additionally subject to claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that a claim will not exceed the insurance coverage of a health care facility or that insurance coverage will be available to a facility public utility and wholesale electric bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas general problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary period the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds water and sewer bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances industrial revenue bonds certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds irbs irbs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers in some cases a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected lease obligation bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity hereinafter called lease obligations lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation although the lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for which the municipalitys taxing power is pledged a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipalitys covenant to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation however certain lease obligations contain nonappropriation clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby although nonappropriation lease obligations are secured by the leased property disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove difficult higher educations and public education bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds in the trusts general problems relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the availability and restrictions on the use of endowments and other funds the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers airport and transportation bonds certain of the bonds in certain of the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements from time to time the air transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints acts of terrorism and other factors and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents waste disposal bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in a trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds original issue discount bonds certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in a trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase the market discount of previously issued bonds will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount bonds will be reduced a bond purchased at a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates see federal tax status in prospectus part ii market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue zero coupon bonds certain of the bonds may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest when as and if issued bonds certain of the bonds may have been purchased on a when as and if issued or delayed delivery basis the delivery of any such bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of unitholders on their respective

a third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold such rights the sponsor is unable to predict all of the circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds see also the discussion of single family mortgage and multifamily revenue bonds above for more information on the call provisions of such bonds to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date of deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon any of the trusts at any time after the date of deposit litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a trust such litigation as for example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under environmental protection statutes may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxfree nature of the interest thereon while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted each trust has received or will receive opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is exempt from federal income tax in addition other factors may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds puerto rico risk factors your trust may significantly invest in bonds issued by issuers located in puerto rico accordingly an investment in such a trust should be made with an understanding of the general risks associated with the commonwealth of puerto rico geographic location and demography the commonwealth of puerto rico puerto rico or the commonwealth is the fourth largest of the caribbean islands and is located approximately  miles southeast of new york it is approximately  miles long and  miles wide according to the united states census bureau the population of puerto rico was approximately  in   as of july   according to a united states census bureau estimate compared to  in  however the puerto rico planning board the planning board estimates that as of july  the population will be approximately  relationship with the united states puerto rico came under united states sovereignty pursuant to the treaty of paris signed on december   which ended the spanishamerican war puerto ricans have been citizens of the united states since  in  after a long evolution toward greater selfgovernment congress enacted public law  which provided that the existing political economic and fiscal relationship between puerto rico and the united states would remain the same but puerto rico would be authorized to draft and approve its own constitution guaranteeing a republican form of government the constitution of puerto rico was drafted by a constituent commission approved in a special referendum by the people of puerto rico amended and ratified by the united states congress and subsequently approved by the president of the united states the official designation of the government or body politic has henceforth been estado libre asociado which literally translates to free associated state and has been called commonwealth by the united states government the united states and the commonwealth share a common defense market and currency puerto rico exercises virtually the same control over its internal affairs as any of the fifty states of the united states however it differs from the states in its relationship with the united states federal government the people of puerto rico are citizens of the united states but do not vote in national elections they can only vote in local puerto rico elections the people of the commonwealth are represented in congress by a resident commissioner who has a voice in the house of representatives and limited voting power puerto rico is a selfgoverning commonwealth in association with the united states the chief of state of the commonwealth is the president of the united states the head of government is an elected governor there are two legislative chambers the house of representatives  seats and the senate  seats while puerto rico has authority over its internal affairs the united states controls interstate trade foreign relations and commerce customs administration control of air land and sea immigration and emigration nationality and citizenship currency maritime laws military service military bases army navy and air force declaration of war constitutionality of laws jurisdictions and legal procedures treaties radio and television communications agriculture mining and minerals highways postal system social security and other areas generally controlled by the federal government in the united states puerto rican institutions control internal affairs unless us law is involved as in matters of public health and pollution the major differences between puerto rico and the  states are puerto ricos local taxation system and exemption from internal revenue code its lack of voting representation in either house of the us congress the ineligibility of puerto ricans to vote in presidential elections and its lack of assignation of some revenues reserved for the states economy the commonwealth has established policies and programs directed principally at developing the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy and expanding and modernizing the commonwealths infrastructure domestic and foreign investment have been stimulated by selective tax exemptions development loans and other financial and tax incentives infrastructure expansion and modernization have been primarily financed by bonds and notes issued by the commonwealth its public corporations and municipalities economic progress has been aided by significant increases in the levels of education and occupational skills of the commonwealths population the economy of puerto rico is closely linked to the united states economy as most of the external factors that affect the puerto rico economy other than oil prices are determined by the policies and performance of the mainland economy these external factors include exports direct investment the amount of federal transfer payments the level of interest rates the rate of inflation and tourist expenditures during fiscal year  july  through june  approximately  of puerto ricos exports went to the united states mainland which was also the source of approximately  of puerto ricos imports puerto ricos economy has been in a recession that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  a fiscal year in which the real gross national product grew by only  although puerto ricos economy is closely linked with the united states economy for fiscal years  and  puerto ricos real gross national product decreased by  and  respectively while the united states economy grew at a rate of  and  respectively during the same periods according to the planning boards recent projections the economic contraction has accelerated in fiscal year  with an expected further reduction in real gross national product of  while this trend was expected to continue in fiscal year  the expected positive impact of the us federal and local economic stimulus measures led the planning board to announce revised projections for fiscal year  reflecting a projected increase in real gross national product of  the planning board is also projecting increases in real gross national product of  and  for fiscal years  and  respectively the dominant sectors of the puerto rico economy are manufacturing and services the manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the years as a result of increased emphasis on higher wage high technology industries such as pharmaceuticals electronics computers microprocessors professional and scientific instruments and certain high technology machinery and equipment the service sector including finance insurance real estate wholesale and retail trade and tourism also plays a major role in the economy it ranks second only to manufacturing in contribution to the gross domestic product and leads all sectors in providing employment the puerto rico planning boards preliminary reports of the performance of the puerto ricos economy during fiscal year  indicate that the economy registered a decrease of  over fiscal year  in total real gross product gross product in fiscal year  was  billion and gross product in fiscal year  was  billion this represents an increase in gross product of  from fiscal year  to fiscal year  aggregate personal income increased from  billion in fiscal year  to  billion in fiscal year  and personal income per capita increased from  in fiscal year  to  in fiscal year  the significant increase in personal income in fiscal year  is due in part to the tax rebate program implemented by the bush administration during that fiscal year among the variables contributing to the decrease in gross national product were the continuous contraction of the manufacturing and construction sectors as well as the current contraction of us economic activity furthermore the decline in puerto ricos gross national product was not offset by the federal tax rebates due to the high levels of oil prices during fiscal year  the persistent high level of the price of oil and its derivatives such as gasoline during that period served to reduce the income available for other purchases and thereby negatively affected domestic demand due to the commonwealths dependence on oil for power generation and gasoline in spite of its recent improvements in powerproduction diversification the high level of oil prices accounted for an increased outflow of local income in fiscal year  the current difficulties associated with the financial crisis resulted in lower shortterm interest rates but this did not translate into an improvement in the construction sector according to the department of labor and human resources household employment survey total employment for fiscal year  averaged  a decrease of  from the previous fiscal year the unemployment rate for fiscal year  was  an increase from  for fiscal year  debt revenues and expenditures the constitution of puerto rico limits the amount of general obligation full faith and credit debt that can be issued or guaranteed by the commonwealth the commonwealths policy has been and continues to be to maintain the amount of such debt prudently below the constitutional limitation direct debt of the commonwealth is supported by commonwealth taxes debt of municipalities of the commonwealth other than bond anticipation notes is supported by real and personal property taxes and municipal license taxes as of december   total public sector debt of the commonwealth was equal to  million the general fund revenue projection for fiscal year  was  billion an increase of  million or  from estimated net revenues for fiscal year  of  billion the commonwealths budgeted expenditures for fiscal

termination of the trust agreement a trust may be terminated at any time by consent of unitholders of  of the units of such trust then outstanding or by the trustee when the value of such trust as shown by any semiannual evaluation is less than  of the original principal amount of bonds a trust will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the underwriters including the sponsor so that the net worth of such trust would be reduced to less than  of the initial principal amount of such trust if a trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the underwriters the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser the trust agreement provides that each trust shall terminate upon the redemption sale or other disposition of the last bond held in such trust but in no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth anniversary of the trust agreement in the case of an imit an imit laddered series an investment grade municipal an investment grade municipal limited maturity trust an imit discount a us territorial imit a high grade taxexempt bond  year series a longterm state or a national quality trust or beyond the end of the year preceding the twentieth anniversary of the trust agreement in the case of a strategic municipal trust intermediate series an imit limited maturity trust an imit intermediate trust a state intermediate trust a state intermediate laddered maturity trust an imit short intermediate trust an investment grade municipal intermediate trust and a quality municipals income trust limited maturity series in the event of termination of any trust written notice thereof will be sent by the trustee to each unitholder of such trust at his address appearing on the registration books of a trust maintained by the trustee within a reasonable time thereafter the trustee shall liquidate any bond then held in such trust and shall deduct from the funds of such trust any accrued costs expenses or indemnities provided by the trust agreement including estimated compensation of the trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other government charges the sale of bonds in the trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time for this reason among others the amount realized by a unitholder upon termination may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the units held by such unitholder the trustee shall then distribute to each unitholder his share of the balance of the interest and principal accounts with such distribution the unitholder shall be furnished a final distribution statement of the amount distributable at such time as the trustee in its sole discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary it shall make distribution thereof to unitholders in the same manner notwithstanding the foregoing in connection with final distributions to unitholders of an insured trust it should be noted that because the portfolio insurance obtained by an insured trust if any is applicable only while bonds so insured are held by such trust the price to be received by such trust upon the disposition of any such bond which is in default by reason of nonpayment of principal or interest will not reflect any value based on such insurance therefore in connection with any liquidation it shall not be necessary for the trustee to and the trustee does not currently intend to dispose of any bond or bonds if retention of such bond or bonds until due shall be deemed to be in the best interest of unitholders including but not limited to situations in which a bond or bonds so insured have deteriorated market prices resulting from a significant risk of default since the preinsured bonds will reflect the value of the related insurance it is the present intention of the sponsor not to direct the trustee to hold any of such preinsured bonds after the date of termination all proceeds received less applicable expenses from insurance on defaulted bonds not disposed of at the date of termination will ultimately be distributed to unitholders of record as of such date of termination as soon as practicable after the date such defaulted bond or bonds become due and applicable insurance proceeds have been received by the trustee description of ratings standard  poors a division of the mcgrawhill companies a standard  poors longterm debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation this opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation the longterm debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold the debt obligation inasmuch as they do not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor the longterm debt obligation credit ratings are based on current information furnished by the obligor or obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit in connection with any credit rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information credit ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or based on other circumstances the longterm debt obligation credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights the credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk as such they pertain to senior obligations of an entity junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation applies when an entity has both senior and subordinate obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations accordingly in the case of junior debt the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition aaaan obligation rated aaa has the highest

income tax bracket the tables assume that federal taxable income is equal to state income subject to tax and for cases in which more than one state rate falls within a federal bracket the state rate corresponding to the highest income within that federal bracket is used the combined federal and state tax rates shown reflect the fact that state tax payments are currently deductible for federal tax
