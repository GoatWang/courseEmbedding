included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form q unless otherwise stated references to particular years quarters months or periods refer to the company’s fiscal years ended in november and the associated quarters months and periods of those fiscal years this discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future the company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statements for any reason except as required by law   business overview plan of operation in the next twelve months   pinkbrick holdings inc “we” “us” “our” or the “company” was organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation our principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time is to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings we will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business   we do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow the costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next  months and beyond such time will be paid with money in our treasury if any or with additional money contributed by our management stockholders or another source the company based on current business activities is a “blank check” company the securities and exchange commission defines those companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act  as amended the “exchange act” and that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies” many states have enacted statutes rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions the company is also a “shell company” defined in rule b under the exchange act as a company with no or nominal assets other than cash and no or nominal operations management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities either debt or equity until we have successfully concluded a business combination the company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act for so long as we are subject to those requirements   during the next  months we anticipate incurring costs related to filing of exchange act reports and costs relating to consummating a business combination we believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors   we may consider a business combination with a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering   our management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable or early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks   our management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another   we anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital that we will have andor the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex        results of operations   three months ended february   compared to three months ended february     we have not earned any revenues since our inception in november  we do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we are able to enter into a business combination   we incurred operating expenses in the amount of  for the three months ended february   compared with  for the three months ended february   the entire amount for both periods was attributable to operating expenses principally costs associated with exchange act filings   liquidity and capital resources   as of february   we had  in current assets  in liabilities and  in working capital we currently do not engage nor do we intend to engage in any business activities that provide cash flow until we enter into a successful business combination   in its march   report our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   we expect that our management and the company through its various contacts and affiliations with other entities will locate a business combination target we expect that funds in the amount of approximately  will be required in order for the company to satisfy its exchange act reporting requirements during the next  months in addition to any other funds that will be required in order to complete a business combination such funds can only be estimated upon identifying a business combination target our management and stockholders have indicated an intent to advance funds on behalf of the company as needed in order to accomplish its business plan and comply with its exchange act reporting requirements however there are no agreements in effect between the company and our management or stockholders specifically requiring they provide any funds to the company therefore there are no assurances that the company will be able to obtain the required financing as needed in order to consummate a business combination transaction   offbalance sheet arrangements   as of february   there were no offbalance sheet arrangements   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we are a smaller reporting company as defined by rule b of the exchange act and are not required to provide the information under this item   item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules regulations and related forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   as of february   we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report this was due to our status as a shell company and our limited resources including the absence of a financial staff with accounting and financial expertise   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended february   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting        part ii  other information   item  legal proceedings   we know of no material existing or pending legal proceedings against our company nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation there are no proceedings in which any of our directors officers or affiliates or any registered or beneficial shareholder is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest   item a risk
