appoints stuart a arbuckle to board of directors june    am eastern daylight time cambridge massbusiness wirecerulean pharma inc nasdaq ceru today announced the appointment of stuart a arbuckle to its board of directors effective as of june   mr arbuckle currently serves as executive vice president and chief commercial officer at vertex pharmaceuticals incorporated where he oversees vertex’s global commercial team “we are pleased to welcome stuart to the cerulean board” said christopher d t guiffre president  chief executive officer of cerulean “stuart has extensive commercial oncology expertise having held multiple leadership roles at amgen inc including as head of the us oncology business unit where he led sales marketing patient advocacy and access efforts for amgen’s portfolio of cancer medicines stuart’s appointment comes at an opportune time as cerulean begins to develop the commercial strategy for our lead nanoparticledrug conjugate or ndc crlx” “in order to make breakthroughs in the fight against cancer there is a need to apply biological insights and develop unique technological approaches” commented mr arbuckle “cerulean’s dynamic tumor targeting™ platform and lead ndc crlx represent this type of novel approach to treat cancer i look forward to working with the other board members and supporting management as the company seeks to develop and commercialize crlx and the other ndcs in the cerulean clinical pipeline” in his current position at vertex mr arbuckle oversees the global commercial team responsible for sales marketing patient support market research and other activities in support of approved medicines prior to joining vertex mr arbuckle held multiple commercial leadership roles at amgen inc including vice president and general manager oncology business unit he was responsible for sales and marketing efforts for aranesp® neulasta® and neupogen® which collectively generated more than  billion in sales in  and led the successful launches of xgeva® and nplate® he also served as vice president and regional general manager and led efforts to expand amgen’s presence in japan and emerging markets in asia the middle east and africa prior to these roles mr arbuckle spent more than  years at glaxosmithkline plc gsk where he held sales and marketing roles of increasing responsibility for medicines aimed at treating respiratory metabolic musculoskeletal cardiovascular and other diseases mr arbuckle holds a bachelor of science with honours in pharmacology and physiology from the university of leeds in the united kingdom about crlx crlx is a nanoparticledrug conjugate ndc designed to concentrate in tumors and slowly release its anticancer payload camptothecin inside tumor cells crlx inhibits topoisomerase  topo  which is involved in cellular replication and also inhibits hypoxiainducible factorα hifα which research suggests is a master regulator of cancer cell survival mechanisms crlx has shown activity in four different tumor types both as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer treatments crlx is in phase  clinical development and has been dosed in more than  patients the us fda has granted crlx orphan drug designation for the treatment of ovarian cancer and fast track designation in combination with avastin in metastatic renal cell carcinoma about crlx crlx is a dynamically tumortargeted ndc designed to concentrate in tumors and slowly release its anticancer payload docetaxel inside tumor cells in preclinical studies crlx delivers up to  times more docetaxel into tumors compared to an equivalent milligram dose of commercially available docetaxel and was similar or better to docetaxel in seven of seven animal models with a statistically significant survival benefit seen in five of those seven models in addition preclinical data show that crlx had lower toxicity than has been reported with docetaxel in similar preclinical studies crlx is currently in phase  clinical development about cerulean pharma the cerulean team is committed to improving treatment for people living with cancer we apply our dynamic tumor targeting platform to create a portfolio of ndcs designed to selectively attack tumor cells reduce toxicity by sparing the body’s normal cells and enable therapeutic combinations our first platformgenerated candidate crlx is in multiple clinical trials in combination with other cancer treatments all of which aim to unlock the power of combination therapy our second platformgenerated candidate crlx is in a phase a clinical trial for more information please visit wwwceruleanrxcom about cerulean’s dynamic tumor targeting™ platform cerulean’s dynamic tumor targeting platform creates ndcs that are designed to provide safer and more effective cancer treatments we believe our ndcs concentrate their anticancer payloads inside tumors while sparing normal tissue because they are small enough to pass through the “leaky” vasculature present in tumors but are too large to pass through the wall of healthy blood vessels once inside tumors our ndcs enter tumor cells where they slowly release anticancer payloads from within the tumor cells cautionary note on
