global distribution pyrexar hyperthermia treatments increase the effective dose of ionizing radiation in cancerous tumors up to x without increasing toxicity of healthy tissues pyrexar ht systems deliver therapeutic heating to cancerous tumors via noninvasive radiofrequency rf energy  during pht treatment the cancerous tumor is gently warmed to ˚c ˚f destroying the malignancy while preserving normal tissues because higher temperatures selectively damage cells that are hypoxic and have a low ph a condition of cancer cells that is not present in normal cells multicenter clinical trials in

manufacture marketing and service of medical systems that deliver precisionfocused radio frequency rf or microwave energy into diseased sites of the body heating them to specified temperatures as required for various medical therapies the companys products are developed for the thermal treatment of cancer through using microwaverf systems products and services the company has developed technology and products for thermal ablation and hyperthermia cancer therapy through various techniques thermal ablation ablates removes or destroys soft tissues at high temperatures through focused microwave energy superficial hyperthermia noninvasively treats cancerous tumors located within a few centimeters of the surface of the body such as melanoma and recurrent breast cancer internal or interstitial hyperthermia treats tumors in combination with internal radiation therapy by inserting tiny microwave antennae that deliver hyperthermic microwave energy to tumors through the same catheters used to deliver radioactive materials seeds to tumors for radiation therapy this technique would be employed in treating prostate cancer breast cancer head and neck cancer as well as other cancer sites and deep hyperthermia noninvasively treats tumors located deep within the body microthermx microwave ablation system the companys microthermx microwave ablation system mtx has been developed to employ precisionguided microwave energy to ablate soft tissue the mtx is a mobile system that includes a computer a microwave generator singlepatientuse disposable applicators and a thermistorbased temperature monitoring system in march  the company filed a k submission with the fda for premarket clearance of the mtx in august  the fda granted the company a k clearance to market the mtx for ablation of soft tissue authorizing the commercial sale of the mtx in the united states bsd the companys bsd hyperthermia system bsd systems are used to deliver hyperthermia therapy which is noninvasive and delivered externally using antennae placed on the tumor or interstitial hyperthermia therapy which is delivered using antennae that are inserted into the tumor or both these systems include a touch screen display monitor by which the operator controls the hyperthermia treatment computer equipment and software that controls the delivery of microwave energy to the tumor and a generator that creates the needed microwave energy for the treatment additionally the systems include various applicator configurations depending on the system it has received fda approval through fda supplements for implementation of an operating system and a power generation system and other commercial upgrades for the bsd configurations bsd the bsd hyperthermia system bsd family of products includes the bsd the bsdd and the bsddmr these systems noninvasively deliver localized therapeutic heating hyperthermia to solid tumors by applying radiofrequency rf energy to certain cancerous tumors including those located deep within the body bsd  systems consist of four subsystems an rf power generator delivery subsystem thermistorbased thermometry subsystem a computerized monitoring and control subsystem and an applicator subsystem that includes an applicator and patient support system as well as various accessories the bsd delivers energy to a patient using a power source and a multiple antennae that surround the patients body bsdd the bsdd adds threedimensional steering of deep focused energy enabling additional electronic steering along the long axis of the body bsddmr the company offers magnetic resonance imaging mri which is used for monitoring the delivery of deep hyperthermia therapy using microwave filtering and imaging software the bsddmr allows an mri system to be interfaced with and operate with a bsdd target customers the companys target customers include clinics hospitals and institutions in which cancer is treated located either in the united states

additional types of analyses the complete financial data is available for publicly traded companies swot analysis swot which stands for strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats is an analytical framework that identifies the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable for a company enhanced swot analysis enhanced swot is a × grid that arranges strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats into one scheme how to use the strengths to take advantage of the opportunities how to use the strengths to reduce likelihood and impact of the threats how to overcome the weaknesses that obstruct taking advantage of the opportunities how to overcome the weaknesses that can make the threats a reality upon answering these questions a company can develop a project plan to improve its business performance pestel analysis pestel also termed as pestle is an ideal tool to strategically analyze what influence different outside factors – political economic sociocultural technological environmental and legal – exert on a business to later chart its long term targets being part of the external analysis when carrying out a strategic assessment or performing a market study pestel gives an overview of diverse macroenvironmental factors that any company should thoughtfully consider by perceiving these outside environments businesses can maximally benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization key factors examined by pestel analysis political – what opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulations’ impact on the business economic – what economic policies trends and structures are expected to affect the organization what is this influence’s degree sociological – what cultural and societal aspects will work upon the demand for the business’s products and operations technological – what impact do the technological aspects innovations incentives and barriers have on the organization environmental – what environmental and ecological facets both locally and farther afield are likely to predetermine the business legal – what laws and legislation will exert influence on the style the business is carried out ife efe ie matrices the internal factor evaluation matrix ife matrix is a strategic management tool helping audit or evaluate major weaknesses and strengths in a business’s functional areas in addition ife matrix serves as a basis for identifying and assessing relationships amongst those areas the ife matrix is utilised in strategy formulation the external

threats and opportunities a firm is facing the essential difference between the above mentioned matrices lies in the type of factors incorporated in the model whilst the latter is engaged in internal factors the former deals exceptionally with external factors – those exposed to social political economic legal etc external forces being a continuation of the efe matrix and ife matrix models the internal external matrix ie matrix rests upon an investigation of external and internal business factors integrated into one suggestive model porter five forces analysis the porter’s five forces
