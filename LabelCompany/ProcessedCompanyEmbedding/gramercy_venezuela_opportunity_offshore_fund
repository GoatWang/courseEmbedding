collect rice from the pavement that shook loose from a food cargo truck waiting to enter the port in puerto cabello venezuela on nov  as millions of venezuelans go hungry this year food trafficking has become one of the most lucrative businesses in the country ariana cubillosassociated press “why doesn’t the army rebel” it’s a question those of us who write about venezuela hear all the time and i can understand why formerly a stable sophisticated middleincome country awash in oil wealth venezuela has experienced a dizzying downward spiral over the past two years today venezuela’s is arguably the world’s worstrun economy food shortages are pervasive and food prices are rising fast — a deadly combination that has left millions unable to find enough to eat in a recent venebarometro survey a shocking  percent of respondents said they or someone they knew had lost weight because they’re no longer able to buy as much food as this onceprosperous country faces the unsettling new reality of massscale hunger it really is hard not to wonder why doesn’t the army rebel now thanks to a landmark investigation by the associated press we have the genuinely shocking answer far from rebelling venezuela’s armed forces actively profit from their countrymen’s hunger this year president nicolás maduro granted the armed forces virtually unlimited authority over the nation’s food imports and distribution domestic food production is down sharply in the wake of a botched land reform program meaning imports now account for most of the nation’s food but putting the military in charge of this delicate domain has led to an explosion of corruption as wellconnected officers mercilessly prey on every part of the distribution chain from the initial contracts and the foreign currency needed to fund them to storage transportation and distribution in dozens of interviews the ap’s hannah dreier and joshua goodman document a shocking web of military bribery graft and kickback schemes noting that some insiders now consider food more profitable than drug smuggling — another business the venezuelan military has considerable expertise in the graft dreier and goodman found is pervasive first the military systematically overpays for imported food this year to take just one example it budgeted  million for one recent shipment of yellow corn that could be bought for less than  million on the open market much of the excess makes its way into kickbacks to highranking officers with the power to approve the contracts but that’s just the beginning once the food is shipped to venezuela opportunities for graft multiply with one businessman describing the onshoring process as “an unbroken chain of bribery from when your ship comes in until the food is driven out in trucks” importers have to bribe one army officer to allow the ship to dock another to get the food unloaded another to produce a sanitaryinspection certificate just the paperwork you understand no one really inspects anything another to allow it to be taken out of storage at the port and shipped to market the process is cumbersome and no one seems to care that while they work out the shakedowns the food itself often simply rots some of venezuela’s most powerful men are directly implicated in the scandal including gen rodolfo marco torres the food minister who used to serve as finance minister as well as gen carlos osorio inspector general of the armed forces and himself once food minister these are people who sit at the top table political operatives with a direct line to the president neither replied to the ap’s insistent requests for comment this in itself is a telling sign of the rot at the top of the venezuelan regime faced with serious specific documented allegations that they personally profit from their countrymen’s hardship top officials are perfectly comfortable to simply stonewall and why shouldn’t they in venezuela high officials are effectively above the law and they know it why would they bother with reporters’ questions the result is a grotesque paradox a government that bills itself as radically propoor in fact drips with contempt for the poor today with only a third of venezuelans eating three meals a day the officers who profit from mass hunger won’t even answer questions about it as a matter of tactics there’s a ruthless machiavellian genius to the venezuelan setup instead of fearing destabilization from venezuelans’ descent into mass hunger the regime is bolstered by it as foreigners wonder why the army doesn’t rebel at the scale of destitution the generals quietly ferret away the millions earmarked for feeding the people into discreet offshore accounts in puerto cabello venezuela’s biggest port the poor are no longer under any illusions they know much of the food that goes through the port will rot in warehouses while the generals shake down suppliers they know that when that happens raw recruits will be ordered to furtively bury the spoiled food in the town dump and so they watch the dump for military vehicles so that when the men in olive green leave they can go dig up the rotting food to see what they can salvage to feed their
