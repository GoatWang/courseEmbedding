dividend equities longshort fund  second quarter legal disclosuresinvestment risks the fund is new accordingly investors in the fund bear the risk that the fund may not be successful in implementing its investment strategy or may not employ a successful investment strategy which could result in the fund being liquidated at any time without shareholder approval and could have negative tax consequences for shareholders the subadviser also may not be fully able to implement their investment strategies within the regulatory constraints for mutual funds   the investment strategies employed by the fund are alternative strategies that have not been applied to mutual funds for an extended period of time accordingly the fund is subject to the risk that anticipated opportunities do not play out as planned or that there are unexpected challenges in implementing the fund’s strategies due to regulatory constraints for mutual funds alternative strategies often engage in various forms of leverage and other investment practices that are speculative and involve a higher degree of risk than traditional investments such practices may increase the volatility of performance and the risk of investment loss including the entire amount that is invested alternative investments may not be suitable for all investors equity investments entail equity risk and pricevolatility risk the value of stocks and other equity securities may change based on changes in a companys financial condition and in overall market and economic conditions funds investing in midcap companies involve special risks including higher volatility and lower liquidity as the writer of an index call option the fund forgoes during the option’s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the index covering the call option above  the exercise price of the call option since the fund’s investment strategy does not contemplate investing in or replicating a particular index the fund will not profit from increases in market value of a particular index therefore selling index call options also can limit the fund’s opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of the stock portfolio however only to the extent that the stock portfolio correlates with the index underlying the call option written by the fund as part of its investment strategy the fund sells index call options to hedge the stock portfolio there is the risk that the returns of the stock portfolio do not correlate with those of the indexes on which the call options are written further the subadviser may not correctly assess the degree of correlation between the performance of the basket of indexes used in the hedging strategy and the performance of the equity securities in the stock portfolio being hedged it is also not possible to hedge fully or perfectly against any risk and hedging entails its own costs site feedbackterms and conditionsproxy voting policyprivacy
