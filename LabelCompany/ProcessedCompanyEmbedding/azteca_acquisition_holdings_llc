stockholders who properly redeem their shares in connection with our consummation of our initial business combination  a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of a  loan from azteca acquisition holdings llc our sponsor this loan will be repaid upon consummation of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions in the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table any such amounts will be used for postclosing working capital expenses  the underwriters have agreed to defer  of their underwriting commissions or  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full which equals  of the gross proceeds from the units offered to the public until consummation of initial business combination upon consummation of our initial business combination  which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions or  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds will be released to us  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses based on the current interest rate environment we anticipate that approximately  after payment of taxes on such interest income will be available to us from interest income to be earned on the funds held in the trust account the interest rate used to calculate the  of interest was calculated using an assumed annual interest rate of approximately  on the trust account over  months a total of  or  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale of the sponsor warrants described in this prospectus including  or  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account in the united states with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act and that invest solely in us treasuries except for the interest income that may be released to us net of taxes payable to fund our working capital requirements as discussed below and any amounts necessary to purchase up to  of our public shares if we seek stockholder approval of our business combination as will be permitted under the investment management trust agreement to be entered into between us and continental stock transfer  trust company none of the funds held in the trust account will be released from the trust account until the earlier of i the consummation of our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and ii a redemption to public stockholders prior to any voluntary windingup in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination we may apply the cash released from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital although we believe that the net proceeds of this offering including the interest earned on the proceeds held in the trust account that may be available to us for our initial business combination will be sufficient to allow us to consummate our initial business combination because we have not yet identified any prospective target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements if any for any particular transaction or the sources of such potential financing such financing may not be available on acceptable terms if at all the current economic environment has made it especially difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing to the extent additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate our initial business combination we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular initial business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate we believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income that may be released to fund our working capital requirements will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so or the amount of interest available to use from the trust account is less than  as a result of the current interest rate environment we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable in this event we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management team but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us commencing on the date that our securities are first quoted on the otcbb we have agreed to pay galco inc an affiliate of our sponsor a total of  per month for office space utilities and secretarial and administrative services this arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our benefit and is not intended to provide our sponsor compensation in lieu of salary or other remuneration we believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees as of the date of this prospectus our sponsor has advanced to us a total of  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these advances are noninterest bearing unsecured and are due at the earlier of march   and the closing of this offering the loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we consummate our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts in the event that the initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the sponsor warrants the terms of such loans by our officers and directors if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans unlike many blank check companies if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules prior to the consummation of our initial business combination the investment management trust agreement to be entered into between us and continental stock transfer  trust company will permit the release to us from the trust account of amounts necessary to purchase up to  of the shares sold in this offering  shares or  shares if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full at any time commencing after the filing of a preliminary proxy statement for our initial business combination and ending on the record date for the vote to be held to approve our initial business combination purchases will be made only in open market transactions at times when we are not in possession of any material nonpublic information and may not be made during a restricted period under regulation m under the exchange act it is intended that purchases will comply with rule b under the exchange act which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions including with respect to timing pricing and volume of purchases if the conditions of rule b as in effect at the time we wish to make such purchases are not satisfied it is likely that we will not make such purchases any purchases we make will be at prices inclusive of commissions not to exceed the pershare amount then held in the trust account  per share or approximately  per share if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full we can purchase any or all of the  shares or  shares if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full we are entitled to purchase it will be entirely in our discretion as to how many shares are purchased purchasing decisions will be made based on various factors including the then current market price of our common stock and the terms of the proposed business combination all shares purchased by us will be immediately cancelled such open market purchases if any would be conducted by us to minimize any disparity between the then current market price of our common stock and the pershare amount held in the trust account a market price below the pershare trust amount could provide an incentive for purchasers to buy our shares after the filing of our preliminary proxy statement at a discount to the pershare amount held in the trust account for the sole purpose of voting against our initial business combination and exercising redemption rights for the full per share amount held in the trust account such trading activity could enable such investors to block our initial business combination by making it difficult for us to obtain the approval of such business combination by the vote of a majority of our outstanding common stock if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules we may enter into privately negotiated transactions to purchase public shares from stockholders following consummation of the initial business combination with proceeds released to us from the trust account immediately following consummation of the initial business combination our sponsor directors officers advisors or their affiliates also may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination although we do not currently anticipate paying any premium purchase price over the trust value for such public shares in the event we do the payment of a premium may not be in the best interest of those stockholders not receiving any such premium in addition the payment of a premium by us after the consummation of our initial business combination may not be in the best interest of the remaining stockholders who do not redeem their shares such stockholders may experience a reduction in book value per share compared to the value received by stockholders that have their shares purchased by us at a premium except for the limitations described above on use of trust proceeds released to us prior to consummating our initial business combination there is no limit on the amount of shares that could be acquired by us or our affiliates or the price we or they may pay if we hold a stockholder vote in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  furthermore the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination in such case we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i our consummation of our initial business combination and then only in connection with those shares of common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein or ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within  months following the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations including but not limited to cash requirements created by the terms of the proposed business combination in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination in addition our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their right to liquidating distributions with respect to their founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering however if our sponsor or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for an initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of acquiring engaging in a share exchange share reconstruction and amalgamation purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or assets which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination we have not identified any acquisition target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any discussions with an entity that we will acquire in our initial business combination we will seek to capitalize on the significant experience of our management team to identify acquire and operate a business operating primarily in mexico or the united states although we may pursue acquisition opportunities in other geographic regions we believe our management team is positioned to take advantage of mexican or us investment opportunities focused on the hispanic market to create value for our stockholders our management team is led by gabriel brener who has over  years of transaction experience investing in a principal capacity for control and minority stakes across numerous industries and geographies we are supported by various entities owned by the brener family without any binding agreements in this regard in both the us and mexico which we expect will help facilitate sourcing evaluating structuring and operating any business we may acquire however even a strong infrastructure or network cannot guarantee we will find a suitable acquisition opportunity within  months or consummate a successful initial business combination members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination we expect this commitment initially to be approximately  hours per month in the aggregate however the amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination

one of the top five networks in the us regardless of language and the mostwatched spanishlanguage broadcast television network in the us in which the brener family owns a minority interest while we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector we intend to focus on industries or sectors that complement our management team’s background such as the fields of transportation industrials manufacturing food and beverage financial services hospitality agribusiness media including television and newspapers sports real estate and energy and businesses focused on serving the hispanic markets in the united states we believe that our contacts and sources ranging from owners of private and public companies private equity funds investment bankers attorneys accountants and business brokers and former government officials in mexico including executives of governmentowned entities in the energy and electricity sectors will allow us to generate attractive acquisition opportunities however even a strong network cannot guarantee we will find a suitable acquisition opportunity within  months or consummate a successful initial business combination we anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire  of the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses we may however structure our initial business combination to acquire less than  of such interests or assets of the target business but we will only consummate such business combination if we or any entity that is a successor to us in an initial business combination will become the majority stockholder of the target or are not required to register as an “investment company” under the investment company act of  as amended or the investment company act we will not consider any transaction that does not meet this criterion even though we will own a majority interest in the target our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction for example we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target in this case we would acquire a  controlling interest in the target however as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination our management team will focus on creating stockholder value by leveraging its experience in the management operation and financing of businesses to improve the efficiency of operations and implement strategies to grow revenue either organically or through acquisitions consistent with this strategy we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses we will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines • middlemarket business  we will seek to acquire one or more businesses with an enterprise value of approximately  to  determined in the sole discretion of our officers and directors according to reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies we believe that our focus on businesses in this middle market segment will offer us a substantial number of potential business targets that have strong operations and have shown consistent revenue and earnings growth or that we believe can benefit from improved operations and achieve and maintain significant revenue and earnings growth • established companies with proven track records  we will seek to acquire established companies with sound historical financial performance we will typically focus on companies with a history of strong operating and financial results and strong fundamentals we do not intend to acquire startup companies or companies with recurring negative free cash flow • companies with or with the potential for strong free cash flow generation  we will seek to acquire one or more businesses that already have or have the potential to generate strong stable and increasing free cash flow we will focus on one or more businesses that have predictable revenue streams • strong competitive industry position  we intend to focus on targets that have a leading growing or niche market position in their respective industries we will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of target businesses relative to their competitors we will seek to acquire a business that demonstrates advantages when compared to their competitors which may help to protect their market position and profitability • experienced management team  we will seek to acquire one or more businesses with a strong experienced management team that provides a platform for us to further develop the acquired business’ management capabilities we will seek to partner with a potential target’s management team and expect that the operating and financial abilities of our executive team will complement their own capabilities • business with revenue and earnings growth or potential for revenue and earnings growth  we will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have achieved or have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of brand and new product development increased production capacity expense reduction synergistic followon acquisitions and increased operating leverage • diversified customer and supplier base  we will seek to acquire businesses that have a diversified customer and supplier base we believe that companies with a diversified customer and supplier base are generally better able to endure economic downturns industry consolidation changing business preferences and other factors that may negatively impact their customers suppliers and competitors • benefit from being a public company  we intend to acquire a company that will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company • companies with the ability to participate in the growth of mexico  the mexican economy is expected to grow at  –  over the next several years the unemployment rate in  was an estimated  and is expected to edge downward to below  by  according to the imf world economic outlook database based on information from business monitor international economic stability has been further buttressed by the mexican manufacturing sector with exports of manufactured goods close to record highs at the start of  recent changes in federal law have eased restrictions on foreign company participation in certain industries such as the energy sector as part of government efforts to offset the nation’s declining oil production though not exclusively we will seek businesses that are able to benefit from these conditions in mexico these criteria are not intended to be exhaustive any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based to the extent relevant on these general guidelines as well as other considerations factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant in the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination which as discussed in this prospectus would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the sec over the course of their careers the members of our management team have developed a broad international network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of investment opportunities this network has been developed through our management team’s • experience in sourcing acquiring operating financing and selling businesses • reputation for integrity and fair dealing with sellers capital providers and target management teams • significant experience as advisors on transactions • experience in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions and • experience in operating in developing environments around the world this network has provided our management team with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous transactions we believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with an important source of investment opportunities in addition we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources including investment market participants private equity groups investment banking firms consultants accounting firms and large business enterprises certain members of our management team have spent their entire careers working with mexicobased businesses and have developed a network of professional services contacts and business relationships in that region however even a strong network cannot guarantee we will find a suitable acquisition opportunity within  months or consummate a successful initial business combination in evaluating a prospective target business we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass among other things meetings with incumbent management and employees document reviews inspection of facilities as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us we are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor officers or directors in the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor officers or directors we or a committee of independent directors would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the financial industry regulatory authority or finra that our initial business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view additionally gabriel brener our chairman ceo and president will indirectly own common stock through our sponsor and directly own warrants and accordingly may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination further our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination each of our officers and directors other than our independent directors has agreed pursuant to a written agreement with us that until the earliest of our initial business combination our liquidation and such time as he ceases to be an officer or director to present to us for our consideration prior to presentation to any other entity any suitable business transaction opportunities subject to any preexisting fiduciary or contractual obligations he might have gabriel brener our chairman ceo and president and pablo brener our director and the father of gabriel brener have such preexisting fiduciary duties not only to brener international group llc and grupo bre but to each of their respective numerous subsidiaries and affiliates as more fully discussed in “management — conflicts of interest” if any of such officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has preexisting fiduciary or contractual obligations he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us in addition our officers have agreed not to participate in the formation of or become an officer or director of any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering prior to the date of this prospectus we will file a registration statement on form a with the sec to
