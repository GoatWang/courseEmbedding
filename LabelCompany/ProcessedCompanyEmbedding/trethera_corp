partnering conference  view all news privacy policy scroll to top technology  trethera our scientific expertise spans the network of metabolic pathways that control the production of nucleic acids as well as the signal transduction pathways that allow cells to adapt to replication stress and dna damage repair certain cancers are characterized by high levels of dna replication stress due to increased signaling from oncogenic cells this phenomenon renders such cancers significantly more susceptible than normal cells to therapies that constrain nucleotide biosynthesis however these therapies are often ineffective because of three mechanisms intrinsic mechanisms that protect the genome against replication stress and damage the ability of cancer cells to switch their nucleotide production to alternate biosynthetic pathways biological controls that rapidly adjust consumption to compensate for insufficient production identification of the key checkpoints that control these three resistance mechanisms has enabled the development of pharmacological agents that specifically intervene within these pathways unlike many cancer drugs in development which are based on targeted inhibitors as single treatments trethera is adopting a fundamentally different approach multitarget metabolic therapy this approach enables precise inhibition of the pathways that cancer cells utilize to overcome single agent therapies  by using a cotargeting approach at the very beginning of treatment the risks of drug resistance andor poor response rates are minimized publications trethera
