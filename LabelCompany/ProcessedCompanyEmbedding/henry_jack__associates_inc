to the sec item a  risk factors the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the companys operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry if the economic environment worsens we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending deterioration in general economic conditions could reduce transaction volumes and the companys related revenues changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their acquisition or financial failure competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete security problems could damage our reputation and business we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks and other forms of cyberterrorism individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data media can be lost in shipment under state and proposed federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to us and also may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by breaches eliminating computer viruses and addressing other security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is very large and

supports consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions this could result in financial as well as reputational loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services  in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers expose us to damage claims and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation result in damage claims lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business increase costs or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act signed into law in  significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry producing new regulatory agencies and voluminous new regulations many of which are still being written these new regulations may require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations in particular numerous new regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability our failure to comply with regulations or to meet regulatory expectations could adversely affect our business and results of operations while much of our operations are not directly subject to regulations applicable to financial institutions as a provider of processing services to such institutions we are examined on a regular basis by various regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions substantial recent merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others we anticipate that the number of infringement claims will increase as the number of our software solutions and services increases and the functionality of our products and services expands any such claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us if our defense of such claims is not successful  we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers our primary market consists of approximately  commercial and savings banks and  credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures over the last few years and mergers and acquisitions over the last several decades and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate we have acquired a number of businesses in the last decade and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory   and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of key employees if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of sales and delays in new product development and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers we may not be able to manage growth we have grown both internally and through acquisitions our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks some of our recent acquisitions include business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of five or more years because of the rapid growth of our outsourcing business over the last five years we will experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal over the next few years renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer item b   unresolved staff

recurring outsourcing fees and transaction processing fees that predominantly have contract terms of five years or greater support and service fees also include inhouse maintenance fees on primarily annual contract terms less predictable software license fees and hardware sales complement our primary revenue sources we continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins during the last five fiscal years our revenues have grown from  in fiscal  to  in fiscal   income from continuing operations has grown from  in fiscal  to  in fiscal   this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion supplemented by strategic acquisitions we have two reportable segments bank systems and services and credit union systems and services the respective segments include all related license support and service and hardware sales along with the related cost of sales we continue to focus on areas of our company to accomplish our ongoing objective of providing the best integrated solutions products and customer service available to our clients we are currently cautiously optimistic regarding ongoing economic improvement and expect our clients to continue investing in our products and services that are needed to improve their operating efficiencies and performance we anticipate consolidation within the financial services industry to continue including some reduced amount of bank failures and an increasing amount of merger and acquisition activity regulatory conditions and legislation such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act will continue to impact the financial services industry and potentially motivate some financial institutions to postpone discretionary spending a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows all dollar amounts are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal  to fiscal  and compare fiscal  to fiscal   results of operations fiscal  compared to fiscal  in fiscal   revenues increased  or  compared to the prior year due primarily to strong growth in all components of support and service revenues particularly our electronic payment services and our outsourcing services the growth in revenue and the companys continued focus on cost management continued to drive up gross margins which has resulted in a  increase in gross profit operating expenses increased  for the year mainly due to expenses related to the impact of widespread flooding caused by hurricane sandy on our lyndhurst new jersey item processing center expenses related to this event totaled  for fiscal  net of  insurance recoveries received in the year insurance claims have been made by jha to recover the portions of the remaining expenses incurred related to hurricane sandy these open insurance recovery claims have not been finalized and no amounts have been recorded in the financial results for the year ended june   the amount recovered will likely be less than the amount of the expense increased revenue and gross margins partially offset by increased operating expenses resulted in a combined  increase in net income for fiscal  we move into fiscal  following record revenue achieved in fiscal  significant portions of our business continue to come from recurring revenue and our healthy sales pipeline is also encouraging our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address and in these times they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability and efficiency our strong balance sheet access to extensive lines of credit the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities to extend our customer base and produce returns for our stockholders  table of contents revenue license revenue year ended      june    change           license          percentage of total revenue           license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a nonexclusive nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution license revenue has remained consistent to last year due to strong results from our core and complementary credit union products being offset by reduced revenue from our alogent® products our suite of deposit and image capture products targeted at large financial institutions which reduced from a particularly strong prior year while license fees will fluctuate recent trends indicate that our customers are increasingly electing to contract for our products via outsourced delivery rather than a traditional license as our outsourced delivery does not require an upfront capital

performance across debitcredit card processing services online bill payment services and ach processing outsourcing services for banks and credit unions continue to drive revenue growth as customers continue to show a preference for outsourced delivery of our solutions we expect the trend towards outsourced product delivery to benefit outsourcing services revenue for the foreseeable future revenues from outsourcing services are typically earned under multiyear service contracts and therefore provide a longterm stream of recurring revenues implementation services revenue increased due mainly to increased implementations of our core banking and credit union platform products and related complementary products coupled with higher merger conversion revenues from our core banking

recognized when the hardware is shipped to our customers hardware revenue decreased due to a decrease in the number of third party hardware systems and components delivered although there will be continuing fluctuations we expect an overall decreasing trend in hardware sales due to the change in sales mix towards outsourcing contracts which typically do not include hardware and the

well as continued revenue growth in all three of our components of revenue license support and service and hardware during fiscal  the company continued to focus on cost management and also reduced interest cost through our sustained repayment of longterm debt these changes have resulted in a  increase in net income the current condition of the us financial markets continues to impact the overall demand and spending for new products and services by some of our customers the profitability of many financial institutions continues to improve but in many cases remains low and this appears to have resulted in some reduction of demand for new products and services during the past four years a number of financial institutions have closed or merged due to regulatory action we believe that regulatory closings will continue to decline through fiscal  absent a significant downturn in the economy furthermore the increase in bank failures and forced consolidations has been to some extent

updates did not have any impact on the financial statements in september  the fasb issued asu no  testing goodwill for impairment which was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   the amendments in the update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the provisions in this update were effective for the company beginning july   and its adoption did not have any impact on the financial statements in july  the fasb issued asu no  intangibles  goodwill and other the amendments in the update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test the provisions in this update will be effective for the company beginning july   and we do not anticipate that this update will materially impact the financial statements in july  the fasb issued asu no  income taxes the amendments update guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists the provisions in this update will be effective for the company beginning january   and we do not anticipate that this update will materially impact the financial statements critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the significant accounting policies are discussed in note  to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both  a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition   we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the securities and exchange commission the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in the financial statements  table of contents license fee revenue  for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements”  none of these elements alone are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements generally accepted accounting principles require revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately when we determine that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement but does exist for all of the undelivered elements revenue is recognized following the residual method allowed by current accounting pronouncements under the residual method a residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted support and service fee revenue  implementation services are generally for installation implementation and configuration of our systems and for training of our customer’s employees these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately generally revenue is recognized when services are completed on certain larger implementations revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on direct labor hours maintenance support revenue is recognized prorata over the contract period typically one year vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates outsourced data processing services and electronic payment services revenues are recognized based on the fair value of individual elements in the month the transactions were processed or the services were rendered hardware revenue  hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer when title and risk of loss are transferred in most cases we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell but arrange for thirdparty suppliers to dropship the products to our customers on our behalf some of our hardware revenues are derived under “arrangements” as defined within us gaap to the extent hardware revenue is part of such an arrangement and is not deemed essential to the functionality of any of the other elements to the arrangement it is recognized based on vsoe of fair value at the time of delivery the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period depreciation and amortization expense the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company’s future consolidated operating results all long lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis capitalization of software development costs we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these  table of contents factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates the companys most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements item a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we d o not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we have no outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june   and are therefore not currently exposed to interest risk

core platforms from every competitive platform • highly effective change management and control processes and • a best practices methodology developed and refined through the companywide daytoday experience supporting over  diverse clients most inhouse customers contract for annual software support services and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for jha these support services are typically priced at approximately  to  of the respective product’s software license fee these fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased annual software support fees are typically billed during june and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year with proration for new product implementations that occur during the year hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or jha gives notice of termination at least  days prior to contract expiration high levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for inhouse customers however these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees jha regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated randomly by routine support requests this process shows that we consistently exceed our customers’ servicerelated expectations backlog backlog consists of contracted inhouse products and services that have not been delivered backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multiyear outsourcing contracts and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period backlog as of june   totaled  million  consisting of contracts signed for future delivery of software hardware and implementation services inhouse backlog of approximately  million  and   million  for outsourcing services approximately   million  of the outsourcing services backlog as of  june    is not expected to be realized during fiscal    due to the longterm nature of our outsourcing contracts backlog as of  june    totaled   million  consisting of   million  for future delivery of inhouse software hardware and implementation services inhouse backlog and   million  for outsourcing services  the inhouse backlog does not include amounts related to items that have been delivered but cannot be recognized as revenue due to accounting rules for software revenue recognition those amounts are included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet to the extent that they have been billed to the customer as of june   and   our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multiyear contracts and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal    the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities research and development we invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance our core and the majority of our complementary systems are typically enhanced once each year productspecific enhancements are largely customerdriven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups change control boards strategic initiatives meetings annual user group meetings and ongoing customer contact we also continually evaluate and implement process

select products and services in the caribbean europe canada and south america international sales account for approximately  of jha’s total revenue in each of the three years ended june      and   competition the market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong some of jha’s current competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater financial resources the principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include productservice functionality price operating flexibility and easeofuse customer support and existing customer references for more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future jack henry banking and symitar compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions including fidelity national information services inc fiserv inc and dh corporation  profitstars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities intellectual property patents and trademarks   although we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology we have registered or filed applications  for our primary trademarks most of our technology is not patented instead we rely on a combination of contractual rights copyrights trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants resellers customers and potential customers access to and distribution of our company’s source code is restricted and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology we cannot be certain that the steps taken in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology regulatory compliance jha maintains a corporate commitment to address compliance issues and implement requirements imposed by the federal regulators prior to the effective date of such requirements when adequate prior notice is given jha’s compliance program is provided by a team of compliance analysts and auditors that possess extensive regulatory agency and financial institution experience and a thorough working knowledge of jha and our solutions these compliance professionals leverage multiple channels to remain informed about potential and recently enacted regulatory requirements including regular discussions on emerging topics with the federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” examination team and training sessions sponsored by various professional associations jha has a process to inform internal departments of new and revised regulatory requirements upcoming regulatory changes also are presented to the company’s productspecific change control boards and the necessary product changes are included in the ongoing product development cycle a representative of jha’s compliance organization serves on every change control board to ensure that the regulatory perspective is addressed in proposed productservice changes we publish newsletters to keep our customers informed of regulatory changes that could impact their operations periodically customer advisory groups are assembled to discuss significant regulatory changes internal audits of our systems networks operations business recovery plans and applications are conducted and specialized outside firms are periodically engaged to perform testing and validation of our systems processes plans and security ensuring that confidential information remains private is a high priority and jha’s initiatives to protect confidential information include regular thirdparty application reviews intended to better secure information access additional thirdparty reviews are performed throughout the organization such as vulnerability tests intrusion tests and statement on standards for attestation engagements ssae  reviews the ffiec conducts annual reviews throughout the company and issues reports that are reviewed by the jha risk and compliance committee of the board of directors government regulation the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation all financial institutions are subject to substantial regulatory oversight and supervision our products and services must comply with the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our customers including but not limited to those mandated by federal truthinlending and truthinsavings rules the privacy of consumer financial information regulations usury laws the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act the electronic funds transfer act the fair credit reporting act the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act the grammleachbliley act the community reinvestment act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the compliance of jha’s products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the particular functionality the interactive design the classification of customers and the manner in which the customer utilizes the products and services our customers are contractually responsible for assessing and determining what is required of them under these regulations and then we assist them in meeting their regulatory needs through our products and services the impact of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act is still evolving as the regulations are written to implement the various provisions of the law we cannot predict the impact these regulations any future amendments to these regulations or any newly implemented regulations will have on our business in the future jha is not chartered by the office of the comptroller of currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system the national credit union administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise depository institutions however operating as a service provider to

regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec at httpwwwsecgov  item a  risk factors the companys business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ from those expected or desired security problems could damage our reputation and business we rely on industrystandard encryption network and internet security systems most of which we license from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the internet computer networks and the internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks and other forms of cyberterrorism individual personal computers can be stolen and customer data media can be lost in shipment under state and proposed federal laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate security risks may result in liability to our customers damage to our reputation and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products we will continue to expend significant capital and other resources protecting against the threat of security breaches and in the event of a breach we may need to expend resources alleviating problems caused by such breach addressing security problems may result in interruptions delays or cessation of service to users any of which could harm our business operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers damage our reputation expose us to damage claims and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment our backup systems and procedures may not prevent disruption such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services in the event that an interruption extends for more than several hours we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue have a negative impact on our reputation result in damage claims lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs failures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss the volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is significant and continues to grow we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions facilitated by us include debit card credit card electronic bill payment transactions automated clearing house “ach” payments and check clearing that support consumers financial institutions and other businesses if the continuity of operations integrity of processing or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions this could result in financial as well as reputational loss to us in addition we rely on various financial institutions to provide ach services in support of funds settlement for certain of our products if we are unable to obtain such ach services in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations in addition we  may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us a material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in rule af under the securities exchange act of  as amended in june  we restated our consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended september   for the years ended june    and  and for the quarterly periods within the fiscal years ended june   and  the restated periods the determination to restate the financial statements for the restated periods was made upon the identification of errors related to our method of accounting for revenue from certain bundled software multielement agreements in connection with the consolidated financial statements for the year ending june   management believes that the identified material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting were fully remediated effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to mitigate risk of fraud if additional material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition restrict our ability to access the capital markets require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence our business may be adversely impacted by us and global market and economic conditions we derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry if the economic environment worsens we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending deterioration in general economic conditions could reduce transaction volumes and the companys related revenues changes in the banking and credit union industry could reduce demand for our products  cyclical fluctuations in economic conditions affect profitability and revenue growth at commercial banks and credit unions because our business is concentrated in financial institutions unfavorable economic conditions negatively affect the spending of banks and credit unions including spending on computer software and hardware such conditions could reduce both our sales to new customers and upgradecomplementary product sales to existing customers the company could also experience the loss of customers due to their acquisition or financial failure competition or general economic conditions may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers which could result in lower margins and reduce income we vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines we compete on the basis of product quality reliability performance ease of use quality of support and services integration with other products and pricing some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size product lines greater marketing resources or exclusive intellectual property rights new competitors regularly appear with new products services and technology for financial institutions if competitors offer more favorable pricing payment or other contractual terms warranties or functionality or if general economic conditions decline such that customers are less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services we may need to lower prices or offer favorable terms in order to successfully compete the loss of key employees could adversely affect our business we depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees our company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals we have recently completed a planned transition of chief executive officer from jack prim to david foss a senior executive with long company tenure if we lose one or more of our key employees we could suffer a loss of managerial experience and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers the services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business increase costs or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a supplier of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union association among other regulatory agencies these agencies regulate services we provide and the manner in which we operate and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable laws and regulations  in addition existing laws regulations and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth or expansion the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act signed into law in  significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry producing new regulatory agencies and voluminous new regulations some of which are still being written the consumer financial protection bureau was established which is implementing numerous new regulations applicable to “supervised service providers” such as the company these new regulations may require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel our customers are also regulated entities and actions by regulatory authorities could determine both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions concerns are growing with respect to the use confidentiality and security of private customer information regulatory agencies congress and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined the software we provide to our customers is also affected by government regulation we are generally obligated to our customers to provide software solutions that comply with applicable federal and state regulations in particular numerous new regulations have been proposed and are still being written to implement the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  substantial software research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our software products to this evolving complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers for which we may bear ultimate liability our failure to comply with regulations or to meet regulatory expectations could adversely affect our business and results of operations while much of our operations are not directly subject to regulations applicable to financial institutions as a provider of processing services to such institutions we are examined on a regular basis by various regulatory authorities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines we could be subject to regulatory actions or rating changes and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers our failure to comply with the rules of the payment card networks could adversely affect our business we are subject to card association and network rules governing visa mastercard and similar organizations including the payment card data security standards if we fail to comply with these rules we could be fined or our certifications could be suspended or terminated which could limit our ability to service our customers and result in reductions in revenues and increased costs of operations if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business the markets for our software and hardware products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes these factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues as well as lose prospective sales our growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions we have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses products and services this strategy depends on our ability to identify negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions if we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates we may experience slower growth if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services such claims whether with or without merit are timeconsuming may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us if our defense of such claims is not successful we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications consolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers our primary market consists of approximately  commercial and savings banks and  credit unions the number of commercial banks and credit unions has decreased because of failures and mergers and acquisitions and is expected to continue to decrease as more consolidation occurs  acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate we have acquired a number of businesses in the past and will continue to explore acquisitions in the future we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies we may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses including financial control and computer system compatibility unanticipated costs unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services differing regulatory  and industry standards diversion of managements attention adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers loss of key employees and significant amortization expenses related to acquired assets to finance future acquisitions we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public if we fail to integrate our acquisitions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we periodically review our acquired assets we may not be able to manage growth we have grown both internally and through acquisitions our expansion has and will continue to place significant demands on our administrative operational financial and management personnel and systems we may not be able to enhance and expand our product lines manage costs adapt our infrastructure and modify our systems to accommodate future growth expansion of services to nontraditional customers could expose us to new risks we have expanded our services to business lines that are marketed outside our traditional regulated and litigationaverse base of financial institution customers these nonregulated customers may entail greater operational credit and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs failure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our outsourcing business our contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing services generally run for a period of five or more years we will continue to experience greater numbers of these contracts coming up for renewal each year renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms our outsourcing revenues and profit margins will suffer the impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent  of our total assets at june   on an annual basis and whenever circumstances require we review our intangible assets for impairment if the carrying value of a material asset is determined to be impaired it will be written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of these intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our operating results item b   unresolved staff comments none item

principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the significant accounting policies are discussed in note  to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements we have identified several critical accounting estimates an accounting estimate is considered critical if both  a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue net of any applicable discounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with guidance provided within staff accounting bulletins issued by the securities and exchange commission the application of these pronouncements requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements and whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products and services over time changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and deferred revenue reflected in the financial statements license arrangements   for software license agreements the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product or service has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable for arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until payments become due the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements”  generally none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements for multiple element arrangements which contain software elements and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price esp for our software elements we use vsoe for this allocation when it can be established and esp when vsoe cannot be established the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or esp if neither vsoe or tpe are available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained esp is determined after considering both market conditions such as the sale of similar products in the market place and entityspecific factors such as pricing practices and the specifics of each transaction for our nonsoftware deliverables a delivered item is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if the

asc  for which vsoe of fair value cannot be established are deferred until the only remaining element in the revenue arrangement is pcs at which point the costs are recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period with the related revenue deferred direct and incremental costs associated with arrangements not subject to asc  consist primarily of certain upfront costs incurred in connection with our software hosting arrangements and are recognized ratably over the contract period which typically ranges from  years these costs include commissions costs of thirdparty licenses and the direct costs of our implementation services consisting of payroll and other fringe benefits depreciation and amortization expense the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property plant and equipment and intangible assets which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company’s future consolidated operating results we consider whether there is potential for impairment of any longlived assets and perform testing for valuation if it is determined that there is a triggering event causing risk of impairment capitalization of software development costs we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products for software that is to be sold significant estimates and assumptions include establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment cost incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred amortization begins on the date of general release and the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues including an assessment of alternative solutions or products current and historical demand for the product and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete for internal use software capitalization begins at the beginning of application development costs incurred prior to this are expensed as incurred significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate amortization period based on the estimated useful life and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations estimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable  table of contents income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors also liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our financial results assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customerrelated intangibles as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us such as forecast revenues or profits on contractrelated intangibles numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments which are conducted by company professionals from legal finance human resources information systems program management and other disciplines changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired as goodwill is not amortized goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values cash flow projections are based on managementapproved estimates which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance operations and program management key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates the companys most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly in excess of the carrying value however significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements item a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices interest rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers and interest risk on outstanding debt we do not currently use any derivative financial instruments we actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the customer base we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our customers will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows we have no outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of june   and are therefore not currently exposed to interest risk  table of contents item    financial statements and

integrated computer systems and services that has developed and acquired a number of banking and credit union software systems the companys revenues are predominately earned by marketing those systems to financial institutions nationwide together with computer equipment hardware by providing the conversion and software implementation services for financial institutions to utilize jha software systems and by providing other related services jha also provides continuing support and services to customers using inhouse or outsourced systems consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of jha and all of its subsidiaries which are whollyowned and all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated prior period reclassification certain amounts included within the consolidated statements of income and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended june   have been reclassified to separately disclose the gain on disposal of businesses and proceeds from the sale of businesses this adjustment resulted in disclosures on disposal of a business as a separate line to the consolidated statements of income and increased general and administrative operating expense by  for june    this new line only included gains on the sales of businesses all other gains and losses on assets are still included in the line items to which they relate there was no change in total operating expenses the adjustment also resulted in a separate line on the consolidated statements of cash flows for proceeds from the sale of businesses and decreased proceeds from sale of assets by  for june    there was no change to net cash from investing activities or total cash flows use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates revenue recognition the company derives revenue from the following sources  license arrangements support and service fees nonsoftware and hardware sales there are no rights of return condition of acceptance or price protection in the company’s sales contracts license arrangements   for software license agreements the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product or service has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable for arrangements where the fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until payments become due the company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or “elements”  generally none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements for multiple element arrangements which contain software elements and nonsoftware elements we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the nonsoftware deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement for our nonsoftware deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price esp for our software elements we use vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe for this allocation when it can be established and esp when vsoe cannot be established the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or esp if neither vsoe or tpe are available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained esp is determined after considering both market conditions such as the sale of similar products in the market place and entityspecific factors such as pricing practices and the specifics of each transaction  table of contents for our nonsoftware deliverables a delivered item is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has standalone value and if the customer has a general right of return relative to the delivered item delivery or

hours can be reasonably estimated vsoe of fair value is determined for postcontract support pcs based upon the price charged when sold separately for a majority of the elements within our software arrangements we have determined that vsoe cannot be established therefore revenue on our software arrangements is generally deferred until the only remaining element is postcontract support pcs at that point the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the remaining pcs period assuming that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met the amounts deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as bundled products  services revenue within support  service revenue in the consolidated statements of income for arrangements that include

fees deferred bundled software arrangements revenue and prepaid hardware maintenance fees deferred bundled software arrangements revenue and hardware maintenance contracts may be recognized over multiple years therefore the related deferred revenue and maintenance are classified as current or noncurrent in accordance with the terms of the contract software and hardware deposits received are also reflected as deferred revenues the vast majority of our maintenance pcs renews annually and runs from july  to june  renewal billings are submitted to customers each june and the company has the right to bill at that date therefore we include those billings as gross in deferred revenue and as a receivable on our balance sheet at the end of each fiscal year  table of contents computer software development the company capitalizes new product development costs incurred for software to be sold from the point at which technological feasibility has been established through the point at which the product is ready for general availability software development costs that are capitalized are evaluated on a productbyproduct basis annually and are assigned an estimated economic life based on the type of product market characteristics and maturity of the market for that particular product these costs are amortized based on current and estimated future revenue from the product or on a straightline basis whichever yields greater amortization expense all of this amortization expense is included within cost of support and service the company capitalizes development costs for internal use software beginning at the start of application development amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents accounts receivable receivables are recorded at the time of billing a reasonable estimate the realizability of customer receivables is made through the establishment of an allowance for doubtful accounts which is estimated based on a combination of writeoff history aging analysis and any specifically known collection issues property and equipment and intangible assets property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets intangible assets consist of goodwill customer relationships computer software and trade names acquired in business acquisitions in addition to internally developed computer software the amounts are amortized with the exception of those with an indefinite life such as goodwill over an estimated economic benefit period generally three to twenty years the company reviews its longlived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that the carrying amount of its assets might not be recoverable the company evaluates goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment of value on an annual basis as of january  and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired comprehensive income comprehensive income for each of the years ending june      and  equals the company’s

stock options have been included in the calculation of income per diluted share to the extent they are dilutive the difference  table of contents between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and restricted stock see note    income taxes deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based upon the technical merits of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement also interest and penalties expense are recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  revenue from contracts with customers in may  the new standard will supersede much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition in august  the fasb also issued asu no  which deferred the effective date of the new standard by one year the standard and related amendments will be effective for the company for its annual reporting period beginning july   including interim periods within that reporting period along with the deferral of the effective date asu no  allows early application as of the original effective date entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption in march  the fasb issued asu no  which addresses principal versus agent considerations under the new revenue standard asu no  and asu no  issued in april and may  also address specific aspects of the new standard the company is currently evaluating the newly issued guidance including which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements in april  the fasb issued asu no  interestimputation of interest subtopic  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs this asu requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability same treatment as debt discounts asu no  will be effective for the company in its fiscal year ended june   early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption the company currently classifies debt issuance costs as an asset and will adopt these changes beginning july   asu no  was issued by the fasb in november  as part of the simplification initiative this asu eliminates the requirement to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into noncurrent and current amounts asu no  is effective for the company for its annual reporting period beginning july   and early adoption is permitted in the third quarter of fiscal  management elected to early adopt and all deferred income tax assets
