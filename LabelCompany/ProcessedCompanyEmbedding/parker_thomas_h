00 michigan students found that students arriving at michigan state university from four high schools which began using the coreplus mathematics program placed into and enrolled in increasingly lower level courses as the implementation progressed the existence of a downward trend is statistically statistically very robust p000 the grades these students earned in their mathematics courses were also
