why place matters more than ever in a global virtual world todays business leaders are so obsessed with all things global and virtual that they risk neglecting the critical impact of physical place its a paradox of the internet age now that its possible for businesses to be everywhere at once they need to focus on what it means to be one specific place at a time the best global brands from ibm

democracy marketing has a greater purpose and marketers a higher calling than simply selling more widgets according to john quelch and katherine jocz in greater good the authors contend that marketing

practices quelch and jocz lay out the six fundamental characteristics that marketing and democracy share  exchange of value such as goods services and promises  consumption of goods and services  choice in all decisions  free flow of information  active engagement of a majority of individuals and  inclusion of as many people as possible without these six traits both marketing and democracy would fail and with them society drawing on current and historical examples from economies around the world this landmark work illuminates marketings critical role in the development growth and

‘obamacare’ march    elaine shaffer   comments politics aside the primary question to be asked about the newly proposed american health care act is this will it improve choice cost and outcomes for health care consumers by john quelch dr gordon moore and emily boudreau yesterday president donald trump endorsed the american health care act ahca a plan proposed by republican united states lawmakers to replace the affordable care act aca more commonly known as “obamacare” democrats rallied against the new plan arguing that it was likely to reduce access to coverage and increase premiums however the new proposal actually looks far more similar to obamacare than many anticipated–causing some conservative groups to speak out forcefully against it criticizing the plan republican senator rand paul of kentucky even called it “obamacare lite” representative kevin brady a republican from texas and the house ways and means chairman stated “our legislation transfers power from washington back to the american people we dismantle obamacare’s damaging taxes and mandates so states can deliver quality affordable options based on what their patient populations need and workers and families can have the freedom and flexibility to make their own health care choices” this statement speaks to a strong attachment to personal freedom and choice in american society—particularly within the republican party not everyone agrees that freedom of individual choice should always trump government intervention but perhaps more so than in other developed countries this sentiment enjoys widespread support in america the government should not be able to mandate that i buy health insurance or impose a financial penalty if i do not an employer should not be able to require that i have an annual checkup individual consumers should have the right to decide whether they need these services it is wrong to contend that fostering consumer choice in health care is entirely a farright idea proposals from both the left and the right have created larger roles for consumers in the health care marketplace obamacare opened up a mass market of coverage sold directly to individuals this was arguably the largest driver of a consumer revolution in health insurance it expanded options for those with preexisting conditions who often had little choice before and markedly reduced the uninsured rate however consumers in some states found that their new plans had narrower networks and their physicians weren’t always included in  some of the largest insurers pulled out of the state marketplaces after sustaining substantial financial losses consumers had fewer options to choose from and many of the remaining plans raised their premiums therefore politics aside the question everyone should be asking is will this new plan improve choice cost and outcomes for health care consumers the ahca maintains several popular provisions included under obamacare it prohibits health insurers from denying coverage to patients with preexisting conditions or charging them more money and allows children to remain on their parents’ health plans until age  maintaining these consumer protections is a boon for many people and their families the ahca’s most significant departure from obamacare is the elimination of the individual mandate which required individuals to sign up for health insurance or face a penalty consumers will now have a choice should i purchase health insurance or not for those consumers who value individual freedom having the ability to answer this question will be seen as a benefit however if too many people do indeed opt out of purchasing plans the potential downside is that collectively costs may rise risk pools of older and sicker individuals will undoubtedly raise premiums to incentivize people to sign up for plans the ahca proposes agebased tax credits for low to middleincome individuals instead of a mandate with older americans receiving larger credits under obamacare older enrollees who hadn’t yet reached medicareeligibility those in the s and s benefited because health insurers could only charge them three times more than younger enrollees the ahca proposes that this could increase to five times therefore younger and healthier individuals may see their costs go down while older people will face a larger cost burden wealthier americans also stand to benefit largely due to the legislation’s proposed tax cuts in addition the plan also advocates for expanded use of health savings accounts taxadvantaged savings accounts for medical expenses which are currently only offered to individuals with highdeductible health plans while these accounts do allow for consumers to better plan for future medical expenses there is justified concern that these accounts would be more likely to benefit the wealthy and educated who have more income to put away many of the plan’s most significant changes deal with medicaid obamacare expanded medicaid coverage for nearly all lowincome individuals with incomes at or below  percent of the poverty line and almost half of the previously uninsured individuals who gained coverage under obamacare received it through medicaid expansion the ahca would end enhanced federal medicaid funding for new enrollees starting in  states would receive a set amount of funding per enrollee each year letting them administer medicaid as each sees fit however states without the money to fund the difference would likely reduce eligibility or benefits summary in conclusion it seems likely that some consumers particularly younger and healthier ones may see their level of choice and therefore competitive pricing improve under the ahca while older sicker and lower income consumers may find their options reduced finally the bill was released without a score from congressional budget office leaving the total cost of the proposal as well as its projected effects on coverage unknown suffice it to say that given the unknown costs and heated politics—both between the two parties and among factions of republicans—the debate is far from over significant changes are likely before it passes in congress about the authors john a quelch is the charles edward wilson professor of business administration at harvard business school he also holds a joint appointment at harvard th chan school of public health as professor in health policy and management dr gordon moore is a professor of population medicine at harvard medical school emily boudreau is a research associate at harvard business school creating a culture of health may    john quelch   comments all american companies are in the health business whether they like it or not the private sector directly pays for onefifth of the whopping  of gdp spent on healthcare in the united states rather than viewing health merely as an insurance expense to be controlled every company needs to embrace building a culture of health as a business opportunity forward thinking companies are doing just that after cvs removed tobacco products from store shelves and renamed itself cvs health new revenues more than made up for lost sales johnson and johnson has achieved a  return for every dollar invested in employee health and wellness programs over  years bath iron works in maine has extended a successful inhouse diabetes prevention initiative into the wider community it expects to cut participants’ future healthcare costs over  years by  on average recognizing both necessity and opportunity companies are scrambling to assess and improve the health impact of their business strategies and operations last month  top executives from diverse industries met for two days at harvard business school to hammer out an agenda for building a culture of health in american businesses across four domains employee health which companies invest in to improve the wellness of current and future employees environmental health which connects companies’ environmental policies to the health of populations affected by their operations community health in which businesses boost the health of the local communities in which they operate consumer health which targets the healthfulness and safety of a company’s products and services for its consumers “this was not charitable work” the vice chairman of a large food and beverage company told peers about reducing sugar salt and saturated fat in its product portfolio “it makes business sense” the business imperative for companies springs from past neglect and the traditional healthcare system’s ongoing inability to solve america’s health conundrum poorer health outcomes than in other wealthy countries despite much higher spending on healthcare how is it possible that american children and adolescents—the future of the us workforce—rank last in health outcomes against wealthy country peers not only does this represent a lousy return on investment nationally it has consequences for american business including flagging worker productivity and weaker consumer demand for other products and services as consumers spend more on healthcare relying solely on medical care to fix america’s health problem is futile medical treatments influence total health outcomes far less than prevention—defined not just as better diet and exercise but also in terms of good education good jobs good housing etc the affordable care act starts to address this complex challenge but government nongovernmental organizations and the healthcare industry simply do not have sufficient capabilities or resources to develop and execute innovative solutions on their own that’s where forward thinking businesses are stepping in to implement health initiatives independently or through partnerships continue reading the marketing of prevention may    john quelch   comments the us will devote  of gdp to health care this year around  trillion yet only  percent of that will be spent on prevention including both primary prevention preventing illness in the first place and secondary prevention preventing sick people getting sicker or having a relapse medicine saves lives doctors are heroes and the best earn nobel prizes prevention by contrast is mundane measurement of effectiveness is difficult rewards and recognition pale by comparison   in a recent nejm paper tom farley philadelphia health commissioner bemoaned the underfunding of proven prevention programs while sick people certain to die nevertheless continue to receive expensive treatments why does a utilitarian greatest good for the greatest number perspective not prevail farley cites two reasons when a life is at stake it’s unethical to withhold treatment regardless of cost effectiveness second medical treatments are funded by payers and providers whereas prevention programs are typically funded from public health budgets subject to annual budget cuts by shortsighted politicians   there is another important reason diet exercise and other lifestyle decisions are viewed by many as matters of personal choice even though society may later have to pick up the health care costs associated with these decisions  prevention involves taking personal responsibility for one’s health the worried well do so wearing fitbits or following diets the chronically ill often do not   why do people not respond to good advice regarding diet and exercise continue reading recent books building a culture of health springer  a new imperative for business john a quelch with emily

marketing makes for better democracy by john a quelch book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide because marketing is move democratic than politics in greater good john a quelch and katherine e jocz argue that democracy like a marketplace should be driven by a healthy dialogue that benefits all parties when governments treat citizens more like consumers  studying their needs encouraging their feedback and developing longterm relationships  then democracy becomes more democratic managers and marketers in turn can learn from democracys focus on fairness and concern for the greater good in a sweeping portrait of business government and society the authors challenge the belief that modern marketing somehow contaminates the political process in fact democracy and marketing share six fundamental characteristics value is exchanged goods and services are consumed decisions involve free choice information must flow freely a majority of the population actively engages in the process and they seek to involve as many people as possible isnt it dangerous to treat a politician or social program like a product or a service in

hairs in product positioning by john a quelch and heather beckham print email abstract after three years of development paramount health and beauty company is preparing to launch a new technologically advanced vibrating razor called clean edge the innovative new design of clean edge provides superior performance by stimulating the hair follicles to lift the hair from the skin allowing for a closer shave the company has already decided to introduce clean edge into the mens market where it has a strong presence jackson randall the product manager for clean edge struggles with how best to position the product for the launch one strategy is to release clean edge as a niche product targeting the highend market of fastidious groomers looking for superior skin care products another strategy is to release the product into the highly competitive mainstream razor market where the product can be positioned as the most effective razor available randall meets internal resistance to the mainstream strategy from the product manager for the companys current but aging mainstream razor products and he must consider the effects of cannibalization in his plan randall must recommend an optimal strategy and provide supporting economic analysis of his decisionnot just for clean edge but for its effect on the entire company keywords leadership project management conflict management

event sharpening your skills what do you think working paper summaries  dec  oped when your product becomes a commodity    like death and taxes commoditization of your products is a given marketing professor john quelch offers tips for delaying the inevitable and dealing with it once it arrives key concepts include the speed from product launch to maturity is faster than ever before innovate bundle and segment are  things marketers can do to delay commoditization managers already in a commoditized market must rethink salesforce compensation and pricing trim costs acquire competitors and fire unprofitable customers     by john quelch editors note harvard business school professor john quelch writes a blog on marketing issues called marketing know how for harvard business online it is reprinted on hbs working knowledge how often have you heard a manager blame commoditization for failing to deliver sales or profits if youve heard it youve probably wondered if it was just a convenient excuse or if the manager had a valid point the truth is even when a raw material has no value added and quality standards are set by law or the industry there is still plenty of opportunity for differentiation around availability delivery shipment quantities payment terms and all the other services that accompany the core product marketers must use their imagination as the saying goes there are no mature products only mature managers that said intense global competition outsourcing and offshoring are all squeezing margins increasing customer price sensitivity and making it harder to sustain interbrand differentiation the product life cycle suggests that as product categories mature they become more susceptible to the forces of commoditization the difference today is that the speed from launch to maturity is faster than ever before marketers can do three things to delay the inevitable forces of commoditization innovate a new product that better meets consumer needs even an upgrade of an existing product can oneup competitors and force them to invest in matching or exceeding the new specifications bundle selling a commoditized product with differentiated ancillary services such as aftersales service can appeal to buyers willing to pay a premium for the convenience segment mature markets are large markets that can be divided profitably into multiple segments marketers can focus on providing applications expertise for less pricesensitive customer segments for whom the product is still important however you approach commoditization try to innovate at all costs the most overlooked investment a marketer can make in advance of inevitable commoditization is a customer relationship management system that permits computation of the profit margin associated with each customer based on pricepaid less costtoserve companies need to invest in these information systems early to have the information readily at hand once margins start being squeezed but how do you survive if you find yourself in a commoditizing industry characterized by metoo products overcapacity and frequent price cuts how can you make money  decide which customers you do not want to serve try renegotiating prices with them and failing that fire them you will lose market share but improve profitability  compensate your salesforce on profit margin not sales revenues a volumebased salesforce will sign up any customer regardless of profitability thats ok early in the product life cycle but not in maturity  trim costs and acquire competitors with profitable customers to extract maximum scale economies in procurement manufacturing and distribution  if you arent the low cost producer complicate your pricing structures so customers cant easily make sidebyside comparisons and provide discounts as needed of artificially inflated published prices facing commoditization and nonexistent product innovation some companies retreat to serving a progressively smaller niche of priceinsensitive serviceoriented customers others with favorable cost structures may aim to boost market share but then face the challenge of managing hybrid distribution as some customers want to switch to buying through distributors at lower prices while other customers still seek direct sales support but may not be willing to pay to cover the cost however you approach commoditization try to innovate at all costs to beat it back because as peter drucker said in a commodity market you can only be as good as your dumbest competitor join the discussion on harvard business online about the

» article “china depth and global breadth” interview astrid oldekop   china european international business school ceibs in the people’s republic of china is the shooting star amongst business schools since february the school has a new dean with john a quelch previously teaching in london and harvard now it’s time to be in china he says mbachannel spoke to john quelch about the impact of asia on business schools and how he is going to turn ceibs from a regional into a global brand john a quelch after  years in the us at harvard business school amongst others as senior associate dean and four years in europe as dean at london business school why did you choose to come to the people’s republic of china it’s a moment in time where asia – especially china  is pivotal in world economic growth i have been approached by a couple of other schools for becoming dean but i really was not interested in north america or in europe again i also had a couple of approaches within other schools in asia  in locations which i would describe as asia light when did you decide to come to shanghai as a visiting ceibs professor in  i wrote a case study about the school and taught it to the faculty members looking back this was fairly important because this enabled the faculty members to find a comfort level with me even though i had no particular inclination that i would end up in shanghai in this role i decided to come in the middle of november  what are the differences in business education in asia especially china and the us and europe business education in china is very much weighted towards hard skills subjects finance economics accounting operations and management are all particularly strong areas of interest among the asian students perhaps they would not be so cognisant of the substantial need for soft skills development how do you explain this don’t get me wrong it is not that europeans and americans are doing the soft stuff and chinese are doing the hard stuff there are even native chinese who are teaching leadership and entrepreneurship but as a generalization i can say the ability to mix people from different cultures has not only a cultural benefit but also a soft versus hard skills benefit in the curriculum why would students choose ceibs or rather qinghua i will not make any comment on any competitor but after my reading of the qinghua curriculum and faculty mix it is fair to say that there the hard skills are more weighted it is after all called the “qinghua school of management and economics” not called the qinghua business school the proportions of domestic and international students and teachers are the most important decisions you take as an institution on our mbaprogram there are  percent international students the fulltime faculty mix is about halfhalf the position of ceibs is clearly articulated in four words china depth and global breadth no other international school can match us on the chinadepth and no chinese school can match us on the global breadth the international students are very interested in china and see it as an important step in an international career maybe with an international company or a chinese company going international we make sure that our chinese students have full exposure to an international environment so that they are better equipped for going overseas and investing abroad – something the chinese government now wants them to do nunzio quacquarelli managing director of qs – the organisation behind the world mba tour says “there is a need for innovation in teaching in course construction in faculty mix and so on there is not one right answer but there is a real need for change” what do you believe are these changes going to come from china and asia with  students the size of our mbaprogram is small therefore we are very flexible and in the midst of an ongoing curriculum evaluation we want to make responsible leadership a cornerstone of our general management program everybody agrees that we shouldn’t be substituting cases on corporate social responsibility for the basic quantity of finance and accounting methods but we would also like to drive responsible leadership through hard skills courses i like the responsible leadership idea people are very surprised when a chinese institution says it is concerned with it is the idea of responsible leadership popular amongst chinese business people no but i don’t think that a leading business school should be just preaching to the choir there is a segment of our alumni who are very committed to this area but obviously most business people in china are preoccupied with taking full advantage in the current economic opportunities it is our responsibility to provide some guidance in this this is also an arena where nonchinese students can help to educate chinese students are these very western ideas no the new confucianism expressed by hu jintao and wen jiabao in terms of harmonious society is very much equivalent to our concept of stakeholder capitalism with  graduates per year we have one of the largest emba programs in the world our students are chairmen coos and presidents of their own companies many of them want to take time to explore issues like worklife balance “how do i manage my marriage and my family when i’m working  hours a week without loosing the current opportunities” they feel this need for guidance therefore the concept of responsible leadership has a strong chance to resonate many professors believe that innovation in business schools will come from emerging markets like china and india what is your opinion up to this point ceibs was focussed more on knowledge dissemination than on knowledge creation because we have grown so rapidly we have to become knowledge generators rather than simply knowledge disseminators  just as china has to advance from a production economy towards a knowledge economy therefore we bring strong researchers like professor george s yip to the faculty the current dean of erasmus in rotterdam who will be joining us as full time faculty member in may he is of chinese heritage teaches international strategy and is an expert in multinational companies going to china we will only be able to sustain our claim of „china depth global breadth“ as long as we are generating new thinking where will ceibs be in one year the number of students will not increase you can’t simultaneously say move towards knowledge creation and double the teaching load harvard business school only admits one percent of all the mbas in the usa but if you measure its impact it’s obviously much greater than one per cent you don’t need the biggest program to have the most impact we rather want to have the best applicants in china at the moment the percentage of admittance is  in the mbaprogram and  in the emba the mbaadmittance ratio is satisfactory but i wish it was more robust at harvard it is  with  students at ceibs it is  with only  students we need to reassure our nonchinese students about the careeropportunities coming out of the school a question that is related to the sheer brand awareness of ceibs this awareness is very strong in china and i’m working on boosting it globally so that people would feel more comfortable about it we are pushing companies who have recruited students from ceibs for china activities to now put ceibs on their global fellowship programs these companies realize that in their global organization they need people with familiarity with china they don’t just need these people in china do most of the nonchinese graduates stay in china out of the international students  percent end up outside of china quite a few in hong kong and southeast asia and  percent stay in china most of the students are people who are taking on a long view on asia they are pretty courageous students it is easy for someone to say ceibs is great but i got admitted to wharton it is a great brand and it is better known more alumni the people who actually do say yes to ceibs are a remarkable group of pioneers particularly those who obviously don’t have any china connections how important is it to speak chinese if it was important i would not have been hired on the other hand our international students do have to reach a basic chinese level it is kind of a cultural appreciation and we want them to be socializing with our chinese students business schools especially in the us are selling „careerpackages“ with their mbaprograms in china everybody talks about „guanxi – relations“ you are new in this country how are you going to create your guanxinetwork our mbaprogram has clearly leveraged the existence of the embaprogram any mbastudent can get an embamentor and two thirds of the students do the embas are frequently tapped for student projects case studies internships and full time job opportunities the teaching demands of the embas who are in their s are so high that the quality of the teaching in the mbaprogram is also uplifted so even though you have this largely domestic emba program the englishlanguage mba is not swamped but actually advantaged by its presence ceibs has a campus in accra ghana there is hardly any business school that has serious activities in africa if you run such a program what would normally happen people back home would say “why is my degree being dumbed down and given to people in africa” my point would be “meet these people their calibre is extraordinary” in africa to be at a level where you have the motivation the time and the resources to put yourself through an emba program you need to be extraordinary facts and figures china europe international business school ceibs mbastudents  mba   female   male studentsinternational students  length

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
