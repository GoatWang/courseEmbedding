additional capital from alternate sources to fully execute the plan of operations if such funds are not available the business would likely fail and any investment would be lost the funds from this

business acquaintances of the officers and directors in order to continue operations as with any form of financing there are uncertainties concerning the availability of such funds and the likelihood

acquaintances of the officers and directors regarding potential investments in the company existing companies in the qd market are currently facing theabsence of a mass production technique and without that mass production technique they cannot satisfy the needs oftoday’s market thus many of our competitors’ market strategies areto sell small amounts of qds at extremely high prices our notable competitive strengthsare that we have a mass production technique have influential qd scientists on our board of directorsand can produce our qds at a lower cost thus we should be able to

quantum dots “quantum dot” or “qd” a quantum dot is a is a nanocrystal made of a material that has an electrical conductivity that are small enough to exhibit quantum mechanical properties typically between  and  nanometers a billionth of a meter in diameter or mean dimension which emit light fluorescence or electrons when excited with energy the emission or absorption wavelength can be tuned by the creation of quantum dots of different sizes the smaller the quantum dot the closer it is to the blue end of the spectrum and the larger the quantum dot the closer it is to the red end of the spectrum the unique physical properties of quantum dots exist as electrons within the quantum dot and are confined to a very small space which makes them subject to certain “quantum” effects these qualities are driving demand for quantum dots as a performance and efficiency enhancing next generation engineered material and have led to the use of quantum dots in a range of electronic and other applications including in the optoelectronic display lighting and life sciences industries quantum dots can be used in bioimaging this includes the use of quantum dots for marking illuminating particular cell types or metabolic processes for understanding diseases and conditions as well as the use of quantum dots to act as delivery agents for drug treatments or therapy for a wide range of ailments the fluorescent qualities of quantum dots provide an attractive alternative to traditional organic dyes in bioimaging procedures and are able to image a number of different color wavelengths simultaneously quantum dots are able to withstand irradiation from high powered microscopes for longer periods than organic dyes and have been widely adopted in the bioimaging sector our qd materials for bioimaging in laboratoriesin vitro have already been developed by us in south korea in a lab size limited production our ability to obtain the necessary financing to complete the development of
