brings google’s extensive experience managing containers for over  years to engineers and operations teams at large it was started in  by craig and joe along with a small number of seattle engineers today it is the most active project on github with over  contributors kubernetes has developed a following among developers as a practical platform agnostic framework for application development and management of container packaged applications its popularity stems not only from the quality of the technology but also the openness and transparency of its community gartner has recognized kubernetes as the most widely deployed technology for container orchestration beyond google kubernetes has been adopted by large technology companies like red hat ibm vmware and canonical to manage clusters of containers on their customers infrastructure the project is now housed in the cloud native computing foundation part of the linux foundation “we believe that kubernetes is a seed technology that enables businesses to transform their approach to it significantly reducing infrastructure costs and simplifying operations” said craig mcluckie ceo “while the technology is incredibly powerful we have seen developers struggle to get up and running quickly heptio’s early focus is on making kubernetes more accessible to developers running apps onpremises or in the public cloud in the future we plan to work closely with the open ecosystem to advance the platform and deliver the features enterprises need to run kubernetes at scale” “we’ve gotten to know craig and joe pretty well and their unique insights as the creators of kubernetes” said ping li partner at accel “it means there isn’t a better team out there to help companies take full advantage of the capabilities of kubernetes one of the most cuttingedge open source technologies out there” jim zemlin executive director for the linux foundation said “the mission of the cloud native computing foundation is to support safe innovation in the container orchestration and microservices space we are pleased to see entrepreneurs like craig and joe who were instrumental in the formation of cncf stepping forward to help enterprises adopt powerful new technologies like kubernetes we are heartened by their commitment to both open source and open community initiatives” before creating kubernetes craig and joe worked together to create and deliver google compute engine google’s infrastructureasaservice product joe heptio’s chief technology officer and an active member of the kubernetes community subsequently left
