information in the tables reflects hypothetical rates of return on the notes assuming they are purchased on the original issue date and held to the maturity date if you sell your notes prior to the

liabilities could affect the aftertax rate of return on your notes to a comparatively greater extent than the aftertax return on the reference shares      the market price of each of the reference shares has been volatile in the past and their performance cannot be predicted for any future period the actual performance of the reference shares over the life of the notes as well as the redemption
