circuit judges biggs chief judge  in these cases the petitionerstaxpayers the executors of the decedent farnsworth the senior or managing partner in a series of partnerships styled farnsworth  farnsworth over a number of years seek to deduct from farnsworths federal income tax bases for the years  and  amounts paid by him to the state of new york by way of compromise of claims asserted by the new york state tax commission for taxes due from the partnerships under the unincorporated business tax law of new york  mckinneys consollaws of new york c  section  et seq and sums paid by farnsworth by way of compromise of individual income tax claims asserted by the state of new york against him and his partners  mckinneys laws of new york tax law §  et seq  the farnsworth partnerships and farnsworth and his partners did not pay new york taxes despite the fact that the partnerships as consultants for woolen mills did some business in new york and at least one of the partners in one of the successive partnerships lived there farnsworth being informed of probable new york tax liability by his counsel filed partnership returns with the new york state tax commission which showed substantial tax liabilities these returns were audited by the commissioner and the amounts due were increased by interest and penalties tax liens in favor of the state of new york were filed against the partnerships and against the individual partners in new york after considerable negotiation the new york tax authorities agreed to compromise all tax liabilities if confessions of judgment for personal and partnership taxes which would be enforceable in every state were procured from farnsworth and his partners  thereafter at a meeting at his home in montclair new jersey on april   farnsworth then eightysix years of age and suffering from a heart attack and greatly troubled by the hard tax situation confronting himself his partnerships and his partners some of whom were related to him by blood or marriage stated that he would assume all new york tax liability of the partnerships and of the individual partners if the individual partners would cooperate by executing confessions of judgment as required by new york it is conceded that farnsworth waived his right to contribution from his partners if any for the payments made or to be made by him on their behalf a compromise agreement with new york was executed by all the partners and farnsworth and his partners executed the required confessions of judgment which were entered against them thereafter farnsworth paid in installments the full amount of the compromise which embraced all partnership and individual tax liability as we have said the tax court refused to permit these deductions in gross but did however allow farnsworth to deduct the sums paid by him by way of compromise of his own new york state income tax liability and also permitted him to deduct his aliquot portion of the sums paid by him in compromising the partnership liabilities due under the unincorporated business tax law of new york see   tc   farnsworths executors contend that his estate is entitled to take as deductions all the sums paid by him pursuant to section a  a or section  c  of the internal revenue act of   usca irc §  the commissioner not only disputes the applicability of these two sections but argues that even if the sums paid could be taken as deductions ordinarily nonetheless section  of the new york tax law  mckinneys laws of new york §  prevents the taxpayers farnsworths executors from deducting the amounts paid by him by way of compromise of either his partners personal income taxes or of the partnerships unincorporated business taxes section  forbids any person from directly or indirectly contracting to pay anothers personal taxes and provides that any such contract will be null void and unenforceable the commissioner contends that farnsworths agreement to pay the state personal income taxes of his partners is illegal void and unenforceable under new york law he contends next that under di raimondo v lembo sup   nysd  the agreement made by farnsworth to compromise the partnerships taxes is also void as against the public policy of the state of new york despite the fact that farnsworth was individually liable for all of the partnership taxes as was every other member of the partnerships under the law of new york  mckinneys consollaws of new york c  section  the commissioner contends that since the agreement concerning the compromise of both the personal and the partnership taxes was embodied in a single document the agreement of farnsworth to compromise the partnership taxes for which he was liable was contaminated by farnsworths agreement to pay his partners individual new york income tax liabilities the commissioner does not contend and logically cannot contend that the payment by farnsworth of his own individual income taxes was against public policy  the commissioner argues that under the doctrine most recently expressed in tank truck rentals inc v commissioner   us   s ct   l ed d  and hoover motor express co v united states   us   s ct   l ed d  deductions will not be permitted from federal income taxes when the allowance of such deductions will contravene a sharply defined state public policy therefore argues the commissioner permitting a deduction for another partners personal income tax would undermine new yorks sharply defined public policy and consequently we may not permit the deductions sought by farnsworth in respect to the payments made by him to settle his partners and partnerships tax liabilities  farnsworths executors the taxpayers argue that the compromise agreement made and subsequently executed by farnsworth with his partners for the settlement of all new york tax liabilities is to be construed by new jersey law and thus section  of the new york tax code is inapplicable and furthermore that even if new york law be deemed to be applicable the assumption of settlement of the partnership taxes by farnsworth may be severed from the assumption of settlement by farnsworth of his partners personal taxes and that in any case the policy expressed in section  is not such as to require protection by denying federal income tax deductions  we can perceive no question of conflict of laws presented by the facts at bar the issues presented must be resolved by federal law since federal tax issues are involved if the circumstances presently presented are such as to contravene the public policy of new york within the ruling of tank truck rentals inc in our opinion it would make no difference as to where the compromise agreement was entered into or where it was executed the tax law of the united states is uniform and is the same in new jersey as it is in new york and throughout the united states  the new york state tax commission conditioned settlement upon the execution of confessions of judgment for the personal income taxes of farnsworths partners and for the partnerships new york unincorporated business taxes as well farnsworths liability also was required to be covered by a confession of judgment on this record however it does not appear affirmatively that the new york state tax commission was aware that farnsworth made himself liable for the compromise of all the tax liabilities nor does it appear despite the fact that farnsworth made the payments by his own personal checks and signed some of the confessions of judgment which also were signed by other individual partners that the new york state tax commission knew that he was making these payments from his own funds solus and waiving his right of contribution from his partners section  is not a criminal a quasicriminal or even a penalty statute its sanctions are purely civil i e the denial of enforcement of contracts made contrary to its provisions in the tank truck rentals inc case the supreme court held that fines for violation of state maximum weight laws were not deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under section a  a of the internal revenue code of   usca § a  a and that to allow the deductions would frustrate state policies proscribing particular types of conduct evidenced by state law here the deductions are sought by farnsworth under section a  a and section c  of the internal revenue code of   usca §§ a  a c   we can perceive no substantial basis for making a distinction in respect to the federal statute under which the deduction is sought to be allowed and none in the fact that farnsworth acted apparently in innocent contravention of the new york statute hoover motor express co v united states supra it appears however that the doctrine of contravention of a state revenue statute set out in textile mills securities corporation v commissioner   us   s ct   l ed  and commissioner of internal revenue v heininger   us    s ct   l ed  was intended to be and is shown to be a limited one by the decisions in tank truck rentals inc and hoover tank truck rentals inc teaches that each case must turn on its own facts and that the test of nondeductibility always lies in the severity and immediacy of the frustration which would result to the state from the allowance of the federal deduction under section  payment is not a statutory violation the contract for the payment is merely rendered unenforceable here the compromise agreement was executed fully this is not a minor distinction in view of the fact that the new york fisc was not frustrated for it received the funds for which it contracted by way of the compromise agreement the purpose behind the new york state statute is unclear to say the least we have found no decision and none has been cited to us which applies the doctrine of frustration to statutes purely civil in their nature absent an express ruling by the supreme court on this issue we are of the opinion that the tendency of that court is to limit the effect of the frustration doctrine and we state it as our view upon consideration and examination of the cases that the supreme court would not apply the doctrine of textile mills securities corporation v commissioner and similar authorities under the circumstances of the case at bar to deprive farnsworths estate of the benefit of deductions specifically provided for by the federal income tax statutes  we must determine next if any provisions of the  tax code permit the deductions in issue in this connection we deal first with all of the deductions sought without regard to whether they are sought under section c  or section a  a we will discuss the applicability of the two sections referred to at a later point in this opinion farnsworth argues that by oral modifications of the partnership agreements effected post the discovery by him and his partners of the new york state tax liabilities he made himself solely liable for those liabilities and therefore should be permitted to deduct the payments made by him by way of compromise from his federal income taxes in the years in question that farnsworth did undertake to make himself so liable and did not exact any contribution or reimbursement from his partners for their shares of the sums paid by way of compromise of the tax liabilities cannot be disputed but the commissioner ruled and the tax court in effect found that the assumption of liability and payment of the sums required by the compromise by farnsworth and his waiver of his right to contribution from and reimbursement by his partners constituted a mere gift and was not supported by valid consideration  farnsworths executors position is of course to the contrary and can be summed up as follows they assert and farnsworth asserted at the trial that he could not do business in new york unless all tax liabilities his own those of his partners and those of the partnership were paid or compromised farnsworth testified that the new york state tax commission was unwilling to settle or dispose of any tax liability unless all tax liabilities were compromised but if all tax liabilities were compromised the commission was willing to permit installment payments it was his evidence that to get his partners to agree to the compromise and to execute confessions of judgment he had to agree to waive his right to contribution from or reimbursement by his partners for they hotly contested all of the new york tax claims farnsworths counsel who engineered the compromise agreement with the new york state tax commission strongly supported the evidence given by farnsworth in these respects by his testimony ergo say the taxpayers farnsworth cast upon the horns of this dilemma was compelled to compromise all tax liabilities at his own expense  in respect to these issues the tax court stated it is to be sure contended that petitioner could not settle his own liability for the taxes in question without disposing of all of the new york state claims in one arrangement and that his expartners were unwilling to concede their liability but as the case is presented we are unable to find that any defense the expartners may have had would have been effective nor indeed that it was necessary for petitioner to relinquish his rights of contribution had he made the settlement by paying the entire amount and seeking to recover from the expartners  that farnsworth could not do business in new york unless the income taxes and taxes arising under the new york unincorporated business tax law due from him were paid or compromised is a selfevident and necessary inference which this court is entitled to draw any business accounts which accrued to farnsworths advantage in new york could have been garnished by that state and he also would have been subject to criminal penalties as well see  mckinneys laws of new york tax law §  but we cannot infer from the record that farnsworth could not effect the compromise unless he undertook personally to pay the sums required by the compromise without contributions from or reimbursements by his partners the tax court in effect found against the taxpayers on this issue or at least made no finding or conclusion supporting their assertion in this regard the obstacle to deciding in farnsworths executors favor on this issue lies in the fact that we cannot hold on consideration of the whole of the records the result reached by the tax court was clearly erroneous we have scrutinized the testimony in these cases and all of the documentary evidence we shall not discuss the records or detail farnsworths own statements but the latter do afford a basis whereby the tax court was entitled to conclude that farnsworths mind was to employ his own words fixed to settle it and get the whole thing off the slate and that he felt himself bound by a moral obligation as the chief partner to wipe out the tax liabilities of his partners and the partnerships it must be borne in mind also that there were strong familial reasons for farnsworth to do this some of his partners were related to him by blood and marriage and many of them had been in business with him for years we cannot say that the tax court was clearly in error in concluding that farnsworth was not compelled to settle solus all tax liabilities of his partners and his partnerships in order to conduct or maintain his business in new york  it follows that farnsworths executors are not entitled to the deductions sought by them under section c  as taxes paid or accrued within the taxable years for farnsworth gratuitously assumed full liability without contribution or reimbursement for the payment of the compromise of the new york state tax liabilities and therefore the payments made by him are not deductible we point out also that sums paid by way of taxes are deductible only by the person upon whom the taxes are imposed except under certain special circumstances not present here see magruder v supplee   us    s ct   l ed  quoting article c of treasury regulations  specifically as to the partnerships new york tax liability since the tax court failed to find or conclude that farnsworth had to waive contribution from his partners in order to effect the settlement but did this gratuitously his executors are entitled to deduct only his aliquot share of the sums paid by him in compromise of the partnership tax liabilities  section a  a cannot afford a basis for the deductions since the obligations were found by the tax court to be gratuitously assumed by farnsworth and therefore the payments made by him in settlement of them did not constitute a business necessity  the decisions of the tax court will be affirmed notes  the taxpayer daniel w farnsworth died of a heart attack on september   his executors gertrude adams farnsworth james d carpenter and robert m sharpe by order of the tax court dated october   were substituted as petitioners in his stead the taxpayers wife signed joint returns  see exhibit   §  deductions from gross income in computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions a  a all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business    c taxes generally  allowance in general taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year      mckinney tax law §  provides it shall be unlawful for any person to agree or contract directly or indirectly to pay or assume or bear the burden of any tax payable by any taxpayer under the provisions of this article i e personal income taxes any such contract or agreement shall be null and void and shall not be enforced or given effect by any court  the issue of frustration of state policy was first raised by this courtsua sponte reargument was granted because of it and the parties ably argued orally and on their briefs the issue suggested as pertinent by the court  the precise motivation of section  is difficult to ascertain there seems to be no available legislative history however it is interesting to note that many states recognize as legal covenants to pay others income taxes see e g young v illinois  ill   ne   alr  republic bldg v gaertner  ky   sw   alr  kimball v cotting  mass   ne  lrac  it is possible that the intent of the new york state legislature in enacting section  was merely to prevent collusive or otherwise illegal agreements in respect to divorce proceedings  when asked what would have been the effect on his partnership or partnerships of nonsettlement of the new york tax liabilities farnsworth replied rather disastrous when asked what would have been the effect on the business of the partnerships if all tax liability had had to be paid at one lump farnsworth replied it would ruin them  only two partners apparently did not object to paying or comprising their respective new york state tax liabilities one was peter egan who lived in new jersey the other was james hastie the partner resident in new york the compromise agreement covered all partners in all of the partnerships existent at the critical dates and also all partnerships involved in new york tax liabilities microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser history must allow firstparty and thirdparty cookies

the labor being performed with alacrity and to the entire satisfaction of the engineer in charge the same evening between  and  oclock crossed the bridge near dr bernards old house and bivouacked until midnight when we were moved to fredericksburg which we entered before daybreak about sunrise in accordance with orders the regiment advanced and occupied the crest of the first ridge back of the town between the two railroads three companies of our left wing being in the deep cut where the railroad goes through the ridge immediately after the occupation of this position capt mccarthys battery first pennsylvania artillery dashed up the hill and was placed in battery in our rear after he had fired a few rounds and the pounder battery in the town had opened directly over us killing  and wounding several of my men i had my line moved back about  places which gave the same support to the battery and protected us to some extent from the fire in the rear whilst occupying this ground i sent  of my men along the line of the railroad under cover of the embankment who discovered a position partially enfilading the famous tonewall riflepit and reporting the fact to gen wheaton was authorized to send a company there who after arriving kept up such an incessant fire as certainly added greatly to the effect of operations going on in that vicinity about  oclock a general advance was made the regiments on the right of our division entering the enemys works handsomely the one hundred and second came up in its proper position although somewhat retarded in crossing the deep cut of the railroad on our right loss up to this time  killed and  wounded arriving on the heights we advanced on the right of the plank road toward chancellorsville coming up with the enemy at the toogate near salem church where they had made a determined and decided stand on being ordered forward to fill a space between the left of a new jersey regiment and the right of the line advancing on the road the regiment went up to the position in good order doublequick and maintained their place until the line on our left had been driven back and a heavy crossfire was being poured in from the right compelling us to retire retaining however a welldefined line loss at this place was  killed including capt john large of the color company  wounded and  missing my men brought out from this place  prisoners  of whom i have receipts for our operations on monday may  consisted in moving to support different portions of the line until nearly sundown when the brigade was moved doublequick to support gen howes line in direction of fredericksburg the line posted along a brush fence consisted of the ninetyeighth pennsylvania volunteers sixtysecond new york volunteers ninetythird pennsylvania volunteers and one hundred and second pennsylvania volunteers i took my position on the right of left center company seating myself on a stump to see what was transpiring in the vicinity the men were allowed to go to sleep about  oclock i received a message to keep quiet and kindle no fires at the same time the regiments on my right moved off by their left flank passing our right and moving directly to the front after remaining for nearly an hour doctor morson had occasion to go to the rear where he proposed to establish a hospital but returning informed me that the troops near there had moved the rumbling sound of artillery moving indicated the passage of troops over the road north of us the demoniac yells from the direction where gen sedgwick had the main portion of the corps at sundown told plainly that we were alone with the enemy on three sides of us i immediately sent capt coleman with  men to the front to find if any other portion of the brigade was there or what direction they had taken four men were sent to the right to communicate with lieut morris of the sixtysecond new york capt fullwood deployed his company in the rear and lieut  lyon with  men was sent to discover a road through the forest to the road beyond capt coleman returned reporting  wounded men of the sixtysecond new york where the line had been the party sent to communicate with lieut morris returned without finding him but bringing one of his men in charge of a prisoner who represented himself as belonging to andersons division  strong and standing in line in the forest south of the plank road capt fullwood reported from his line that he could distinctly hear the jokes and jeers of the rebels on coming up to a knapsack and were not disposed to pass until its contents were rifled the party sent to find the road had not reported hearing distinctly the commands given to the lines closing in on my right and rear i ordered my men to cross the fence and march quietly by the left flank the movement had scarcely commenced before we were fired into and the fire returned by portions of companies a and f on the right of the regiment our march continued principally through swamps until arriving near the vedettes of the eighth pennsylvania cavalry who fired several shots at us before the condition of affairs could be explained on learning the correct road to the ford i rode back to close up those who had become scattered in passing the swamp and remained as long as any of my men continued to arrive on getting inside the line the regiment was put in position designated by capt william g ulshoeffer of gen newtons staff loss on evening of the th instant is  including lieutcol patterson  captain and  lieutenants our regimental colors were missing when we arrived at the lines and the only corporal of the colorguard who escaped with us reported that they had been delivered to a sergeant of company i eighth pennsylvania cavalry they have not yet been found but i feel confident did not fall into the hands of the enemy the river was recrossed the same night with that part of the troops among whom we had been placed and the brigade rejoined early on the morning of the th instant whether my action was correct in ordering the march from the position in which we had been placed at sundown without authority from the source that had placed the regiment there remains for higher power to decide i feel that the circumstances justified the act and all who obeyed my orders promptly came away in safety the total loss of the regiment during the operations until recrossing the river was  including killed wounded and missing lists of all have been forwarded respectfully submitted j m kinkead col d regt pennsylvania volunteers capt george r
