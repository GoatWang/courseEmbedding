kraynak attorney at law map view map reviews     i give him  out of  stars by cr denver co mark e kraynak represented me in a criminal case where i was charged with a slew of felonies i give him  out of  stars the case was resolved by a plea bargain where all of the felony charges were dismissed i pled guilty to a single low level misdemeanor on the first day of the jury trial here are a few of the many positive things i have to say about mr kraynak  mark kraynak will fight for you he discovered that the police failed to preserve andor destroyed critical evidence this in turn no doubt gave us substantial leverage to negotiate such a favorable plea deal  mark simultaneously represented me in an administrative law case which was related to the criminal case and he did a super job in the admin case as well  he’s accessible and available   if necessary there was not a single time that i contacted mark where he did not promptly get back in touch with me  mark is a bluecollar lawyer he worked very hard on my behalf to get a great result in my case  mark kraynak is good guy he’s easy to get along with and very professional     endorse mark e kraynak as an attorney by br i am a licensed private investigator and i’ve worked with mark e kraynak on various cases some civil but mostly felony criminal cases before becoming a private investigator i worked for approximately fourteen years as a federal agent with top secret security clearance during much of this time in this capacity i have investigated scores and scores of primarily major felony cases on behalf of the government including cases like murder and rape for example which are usually handled by state investigators and prosecutors this is because the feds have exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute crimes which occur on federal lands such as indian reservation and parks i’ve worked and dealt with a lot of attorneys including mark e kraynak in my opinion mr kraynak is an experienced and highly competent lawyer i note the following characteristics and attributes about mark e kraynak esq  he’s dedicated to his cases and clients my impression is he’ll do whatever can possibly be done within the bounds of the law and rules of ethics to get his clients the very best results and outcomes  mark kraynak is an experienced attorney especially as regards criminal law and criminal defense he not only knows the black letter criminal law but also the practical machinations of the criminal justice system mark is what i would call street smart and has great instincts about people and situations  finally i know mark personally he’s a friend so i must admit to being biased but i can assert with all candor that mark is the type of person who if he says he’s going to do something you can rest assured it is going to get done he can be trusted he’s like the opposite of a scumbag lawyer who would abandon his client’s case or sell his client out for example this is why i have referred close friends associates and colleagues to mark in the past and will continue to do so in the future     highly recomend by cd mark e kraynak is an outstanding attorney you would be wise to retain mr kraynak as your attorney as i did i was in a very dicey precarious situation i was the target of a felony criminal investigation where it was alleged that i had embezzled thousands of dollars from a former employer i’m a middle aged woman with no criminal record really my only knowledge of the criminal law has been gleaned from tv and movies as you can imagine this was a very stressful and indeed at times borderline terrifying event for me to deal with i’m certain that i could not have received better legal representation than i did from mark e kraynak the following points stand out in my mind  the objectives as explained to me by mr kraynak were two fold and each of them were promptly achieved  the criminal investigation was terminated and no criminal charges were filed against me and  a settlement agreement was entered into with my former employer whereby all alleged civil claims which my employer had against me were compromised and settled while forestalling criminal charges from being filed against me was the most important objective the civil settlement which mr kraynak negotiated on my behalf shielded me from six figure potential monetary liability  i called mr kraynak after a police detective contacted me and following a conversation about the matter with an attorney relative mark deemed this to be “a time sensitive” matter as such he prioritized me as a client and began working on my case immediately  i had the utmost confidence in mark e kraynak throughout the whole ordeal because it was evident to me that he knew exactly what he was doing and had done this sort thing in the past mark’s expertise in this regard was deeply reassuring to me and helped to calm my jittery nerves  mr kraynak is by no means the least expensive attorney in denver but you can’t quibble with the results his total fee was money well spent  finally mark is a super guy to work with he communicated effectively and persuasively with everyone involved including the police detective the powers that be at my former employer and of course me as well for all of the above reasons i highly recommend mark e kraynak as an attorney     positive and personal by br i retained mark e kraynak to represent me in a criminal case i was charged with numerous serious felonies including assault and attempted murder i recommend and endorse mark e kraynak as an attorney mr kraynak has many positive personal and professional attributes including  he promptly responds to any inquires whether phone calls text messages or emails usually in less than an hour and always in less than  hours  this case was the first time i had ever been in any criminal law trouble i was nervous i am unfamiliar with criminal law and the criminal justice system mr kraynak patiently and carefully explained everything to me i was always kept very well informed about all aspects of my case and made informed decisions based on mr kraynak’s advise and counseling  mr kraynak is down to earth and easy to get along with i certainly would hire mark e kraynak again as my attorney and also would refer friends and family members to him if the need ever arises in the future     mark kraynak is an outstanding lawyer by melissa i had the pleasure meeting mr kraynak under some not so pleasant circumstances when i sought his services and expertise in connection with some civil legal issues i had with a
