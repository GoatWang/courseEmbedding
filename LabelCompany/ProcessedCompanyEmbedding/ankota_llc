feedback powered by olark live chat software  home care population health lessons from the dutch posted by ken accardi on jul    pm tweet i always found the dutch confusing if were talking about the spanish the country is called spain the language is spanish and the people are either called the spanish or spaniards it all makes sense  by contrast the dutch people are from the country sometimes referred to as the netherlands and other times referred to as holland its all quite confusing nonetheless the dutch have come up with an interesting neighborhood care model that i learned about in this article neighborhood care model in summary the neighborhood care model in the netherlands works as follows there is a selfmanaged team of nurses providing the care rather than only providing the nursing portion of the services the nurses are performing all needed home care tasks related to activities of daily living adls a team of about  nurses is able to manage the care needs for a town of around  people of course only a small number of residents need care on average a nurse sees  patients per day one factor that makes this model possible is that all citizens have the same government provided insurance so the nurses can collaborate easily with the associated physicians and dont have the burden of marketing and sales what can home care in the us learn from this dutch model at ankota we focus on the next generation of home care and a big aspect of that is driven by demographics most importantly the population of americans over  a good indicator for the home care market size will triple in the next  years we believe that by necessity the us model will need to change to a home care model where caregivers are providing services for multiple care recipients in a neighborhood model  here are some specific points to ponder and items we can learn from the dutch model the care focuses on a community and embraces population health which we dont seem to be embracing here in the us as explained in this article about the triple aim today in the us model there are multiple visits to the home by specialists nurse aide etc whereas in this dutch model one person a nurse is doing all of the services we believe in this model but dont think well have enough nurses and will instead want a model where home health aides are providing the care and doing more med related tasks like loading pillboxes under the training and direction of nurses we further believe that by having a caregiver provide services to multiple proximate care recipients instead of the current norm of seeing one care recipient per day that well be able to pay caregivers a living wage with benefits next generation home care from ankota when your agency is ready to explore readiness for the next generation

challenges often make it harder for healthcare administrators to effectively meet the hospitals financial obligations the following tips can assist a healthcare administrator in effectively operating a health center have clear guidelines healthcare administrators should advise the hospital staff to be keen on checking the patients’ insurance eligibility before each visit while hospitals have different policies on evaluating their patients’ insurance it is advisable to make sure that a patient’s insurance information is always updated furthermore you can ensure that noninsured patients are advised to always have a form of payment when coming for their appointment make certain that all the financial policies are communicated clearly to the patients so that they are not caught off guard updated records in a busy medical establishment it is easy to overlook some minor details in the records for instance medical equipment that is no longer in use should be removed from the hospital and also clearly indicated on the records to avoid paying unnecessary insurance thankfully electronic records are much easier to manage than they used to be staff turnover those with a phd in nursing know that staff turnover can have negative impact on a medical institution it takes a lot of resources and time to train new employees therefore it is better to address underlying issues within the organization and seek effective solutions easy payment to efficiently operate a healthcare center you must adopt various forms of payment methods for instance patients should have the option of using credit debit or cash payments for their appointment to avoid delays and inconveniences make sure that the medical facility accommodates variety forms of payment methods patients will opt to go an institution that has no limitations in terms of payment methods the payment options can be communicated to the patients prior to their appointment avoid outstanding balances for a healthcare to operate smoothly there has to be sufficient cash flow in most cases the major cause of limited or inadequate cash flow is unpaid patient fees for this reason it is important to ensure that your patients’ insurance premiums are fully paid in case of outstanding balances you can give the patients a grace period of a few days to clear he debt most importantly communicate to the patients the importance of paying up their medical insurance conclusion as a healthcare administrator you should ensure that you clearly communicate the hospitals financial policies to all the relevant parties perhaps the most important policy is financial regulations it is important for the staff of the hospital to understand the financial policies so that they can clearly communicate it to the patients

driving moves in home health delivery  enjoy her post below the universal homes of the future i am hearing more and more about universal homes these days and it is beginning to appear in home health related news “universal design also called barrierfree design focuses on making the house safe and accessible for everyone regardless of age physical ability or stature true aging in place when thinking of home design for disabilities most of us think immediately of ramps and grab bars when we think of accessible housing but universal design goes far beyond that while remaining largely invisible to the casual observer in fact applying universal design concepts such as wider doors and hallways makes a house feel more spacious” as fred astaire said “old age is like everything else” “to make a success of it you’ve got to start young” these same principles apply to home design plan for all stages of life when remodeling or building even if you are in perfect health now you never know what life may throw your way be it be a minor mishap breaking your leg or something more serious being confined to a wheelchair” the most important aspect of universal design is flexibility remember that technologies are always evolving and your lifestyle is similarly inclined to change at a moment’s notice universal design allows your home to transition with you as life happens rather than forcing you to work around frustrating barriers so what will the home of the future look like  the following is just a beginning of what i am seeing architects begin to incorporate into home designs there will be limited use of stairs lighting systems will be automatic coming on when someone enters a space and turn off when they leave motion sensors large windows french doors placed throughout the house to maximize natural lighting additionally the use of skylights and solar tubes to bring in natural light curbless showers grab bars designed to look like part of the feature not like an addition towel and robe hooks next to the shower recessed storage in the shower for soap shampoo and conditioner faucets throughout the house that works with touch or movement levered handles on doors soft slide cabinet and drawers that require little effort to open and close slip resistant floors cabinets that sit on the counter space for easy access increased space between areas especially in the kitchen that accommodate a wheelchair or a walker these are a few of the elements that we will be seeing in all home designs and remodels   this article entitled the homes of the now

responsive design and amp technology make both google and your site visitors happytoday we’ll explain three more factors which dramatically impact your home care website’s seo and overall effectiveness as a marketing engine speed security and ux matter is your home care website fast here are some facts about website speed that will surprise you about the behavior of your fellow humans  of consumers expect a web page to load in  seconds or less a second delay in page response can result in a  reduction in conversions  of people abandon a website that takes more than  seconds to load now consider this… if an ecommerce site is making  per day a second page delay could potentially cost you  million in lost sales every year if the customer is always right then most of us have a lot of work to do building a fast website starts with a solid framework you can always optimize an old site to make it faster but that’s like putting a turbo on an old civic the fastest cars ferrari and lamborghini are built from the ground up with performance in mind to get the most out of your website consider the following do you have fast web hosting do you have proper caching implemented did you minify javascript and css files do you utilize a cdn content delivery network are your images properly compressed does the website use clean code with lightweight plugins is your website secure with ssl in  google encouraged webmasters to use ssl encryption on their websites to improve data security google’s initiative to create a secure web prompted them to provide slight boosts to ssl compliant websites within the search results in  google told webmasters that unencrypted sites would soon be marked as “unsafe” by displaying a red “x” over a padlock in the chrome browser although this has not officially been rolled out yet it’s on google’s timeline many consider this to be a form of shaming for unencrypted websites but the truth of the matter is http is not secure and https is secure if you are not utilizing ssl encryption you’re two years late to the party and this should be at the top of your list for  is it built with user experience in mind the ultimate goal of your website should be to drive new business this means conversions should be the main priority each page should be designed with user intent in mind for example ask yourself “if a user looking for home care services lands on this page will they find what they are looking for” if the answer is no you have two choices fix the page so the answer is yes optimize the page using different terms that are more relevant to the page’s content with user engagement slowly becoming a core part of google’s algorithm gone are the days of keyword stuffing to rank your website must offer value to the user and answer their query it’s that simple of course keyword optimization is still a large part of whether a page can “stick” for a query but more weight should be given to the following items encouraging users to stay on your website encouraging users to visit more pages on your site encourage users to contact you keep in mind that google will not be a paying customer it’s the humans that find you through

comments click here to readwrite comments topics private duty agency software home care best practices care transitions what does the over  population indicate about the future of home care posted by ken accardi on jun    pm tweet one statistic that is a strong indicator of the future size of the us home care market is the population of americans over  for those of you who have read this blog and downloaded ebooks from ankota before youll recognize the graphic below courtesy of aarp what it indicates is that today there are roughly  million americans over  but that in the next  years that population will more than triple to roughly  million people why is the population over  a strong indicator of home care market size in general there are two large markets for nonmedical home care one made up of the wealthiest population and one made up by the poorest the wealthy prefer to age in their own homes where they can have the comforts and privacy that theyve had throughout their lives in many cases the ultra wealthy will have live in care or at least will have in home care for many hours per day  surveys of private pay nonmedical home care agencies indicate that their average client age is generally in the low s so for this market the growth in the over  population is clearly a direct indicator of market growth   similarly medicaid programs that service the poor such as the aging and disabled home care waiver programs in many of the  states have recognized that home care can be less expensive than institutionalized care there are many varieties of programs including inhomecare and consumer directed services cds programs that subsidize care for the elderly poor sadly the average home care recipient age on the medicaid side is in the s as opposed to the s for the wealthy another big difference is that the medicaid programs generally provide fewer hours of care and base the need assessment on the specific personal care and chore activities that are needed to keep the individual at home  the programs generally pay under hour and average  hours of care per recipient per month for an average cost of  per month plus management fees in many cases this turns out to be significantly more cost effective than institutionalized care and in many of the cds programs the consumer receiving care is able to select a family member such as a daughter or granddaughter as a care provider despite the difference in the average age of recipients looking at the growth curve of americans over  gives a strong indication that the home care market will triple in the next  years what must we do to prepare for the next generation of home care the growing elderly population is a strong indicator of what the next generation will bring but there are other factors as well including a shrinking caregiver pool a shift in healthcare reimbursement that rewards prevention of hospitalizations and opportunities offered by digital disruption and transformation ankota has a

aspects of the triple aim posted by ken accardi on jun    am tweet weve spoken a lot in this blog about the triple aim a mantra defined by the institute for healthcare improvement that prescribes  a better care experience  lower costs and  increased population health you can learn more about the triple aim here according to this article in the new england journal of medicine this rd aim of increasing population health seems to be a ghost aim thats not being focused on or achieved we highly encourage you to read the full article and please note that even though its in a medical journal its easy to read why is population health the ghost aim in summary population health seems to be elusive among the three aims of the triple aim the medical journal article astutely points out that only  of health outcomes are affected by medical care whereas  are rooted in social and environmental factors and associated behaviors plus smart people like doctors like to focus on whats in their control so they are able to make improvements in care experience and able to lower cost but notable to individually change the health of the population so the bottom line is that the healthcare community can only have a  influence on population health in order to solve the problem of population health social factors such as food electricity heat housing and community must be accounted for why does this matter to home care even nejm admits that population health has much more to do with what goes on in the home than with what happens in doctors offices and the hospital this is where home care comes into play we in the home care industry have the ability to be the arms and legs of the population health movement although we cant solve poverty we can provide nutrition cleanliness and some measure of community to at risk people as more waiver programs for the elderly and disabled embrace the importance of population health there will be more opportunity for home care agencies to have an impact the bottom line is that if youre reading this youre in a good industry that fulfills a need growing both in demand and in importance thanks for what you do but nobody said it was going to be easy home care is growing in size and importance but unfortunately its also growing in complexity being successful in this business will increasingly require technology that takes the

mcmanus along with the above articles and hctr itself tim and roger mcmanus have a new book availble on entrepreneur and home care that we feel our readers will be interested in as well     heres a short writeup of the book as well as a link to purchase it summary of the book from tim and roger the title hits home to those who walk the walk entrepreneurial insanity in the home care industry  it may feel familiar the book challenges the owners of home care agencies to look at whether they are limiting their scope to that of a small business or they have expanded their view to be that of an entrepreneur arising from the experience of the coauthors tim rowan and roger mcmanus the page book is packed with insights that will have both private duty and home health agency owners nodding in recognition of their own journey  entrepreneurial insanity combine roger’s lifetime in business development with tim’s half a lifetime in healthcare at home   mcmanus supplied the brilliant experiencedbased lessons for business owners while rowan adapted his concepts to specifically target the needs and concerns of healthcare at home businesses the book defines the question and describes how an agency owner can tell the difference between small business ownership and entrepreneurism  and surprisingly the analysis is less about money than it is about attitude what we have tried to do is get the owner of a healthcare at home business to examine his or her role in the business rowan says  interestingly the owner who is vital to the daily operation of the business – the person the employees know has all the answers – probably owns a business worth far less than the owner who is virtually invisible the book was conceived as the coauthors were engineering programs that fully manage the social media programs for agencies including a special inhome system for publishing positive impressions of patients and their families on review sites like google yelp and facebook  the
