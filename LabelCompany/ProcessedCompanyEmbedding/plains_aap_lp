reported thirdquarter adjusted ebitda of  million which included solid performance in our feebased facilities segment and inline performance from our feebased transportation segment offset by supply and logistics segment performance that was below the lowend of our third quarter guidance our third quarter supply and logistics segment was impacted by a combination of delayed ebitda recognition associated with our ngl inventory costing and the timing of crude oil sales as well as lower than forecasted ebitda as a result of continued margin compression and less favorable market conditions for both our crude oil and ngl activities” said greg armstrong chairman and ceo of plains all american “looking forward we are encouraged by recent signals that indicate the current industry cycle has reached a bottom and are supportive of paa’s positive intermediatetolong term view however we continue to anticipate a challenging midstream environment over the near term and we have incorporated those expectations into our forward guidance” armstrong noted that in response to the industry downturn that began approximately two years ago paa had taken a number of actions to mitigate the adverse impacts and position paa to manage through challenging market conditions such actions include reducing capital commitments through scope changes and project deferrals selling noncore assets and entering into strategic joint ventures which collectively raised approximately  million reduced paa’s capital commitments by approximately  million and secured complementary partnersshippers securing  billion of nonconventional financing intensifying efforts to capture incremental gathering and transportation barrels and lowering its incremental cost of equity capital by executing an agreement to eliminate paa’s incentive distribution rights and in connection therewith resetting paa’s annualized distribution from  to  per common unit which resulted in a  million annual reduction in cash distributions armstrong continued “as a result of these actions we believe paa is positioned to manage through the balance of the downcycle benefit significantly during a recovery as us  canadian oil

measures and selected items impacting comparability to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with gaap management uses additional measures known as “nongaap financial measures” in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future the primary additional measures used by management are adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “adjusted ebitda” and implied distributable cash flow “dcf” management believes that the presentation of such additional financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because these measures when used to supplement related gaap financial measures i provide additional information about our core operating performance and ability to fund distributions to our unitholders through cash generated by our operations and ii provide investors with the same financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial operational compensation and planningbudgeting decisions we also present these and additional nongaap financial measures including adjusted net income attributable to paa basic and diluted adjusted net income per common unit and adjusted segment profit as they are measurements that investors rating agencies and debt holders have indicated are useful in assessing us and our results of operations these nongaap measures may exclude for example i charges for obligations that are expected to be settled with the issuance of equity instruments ii the marktomarket of derivative instruments that are related to underlying activities in another period or the reversal of such adjustments from a prior period the marktomarket related to our preferred distribution rate reset option gains and losses on derivatives that are related to investing activities such as the purchase of linefill and inventory valuation adjustments as applicable iii longterm inventory costing adjustments iv items that are not indicative of our core operating results and business outlook andor v other items that we believe should be excluded in understanding our core operating performance these measures may further be adjusted to include amounts related to deficiencies associated with minimum volume commitments whereby we have billed the counterparties for their deficiency obligation and such amounts are recognized as deferred revenue in “accounts payable and accrued liabilities” in our condensed consolidated financial statements such amounts are presented net of applicable amounts subsequently recognized into revenue furthermore the calculation of these measures contemplates tax effects as a separate reconciling item where applicable we have defined all such items as “selected items impacting comparability” due to the nature of the selected items certain selected items impacting comparability may impact certain nongaap financial measures referred to as adjusted results but not impact other nongaap financial measures we consider an understanding of these selected items impacting comparability to be material to the evaluation of our operating results and prospects our definition and calculation of certain nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures of other companies adjusted ebitda implied dcf and other nongaap financial measures are reconciled to the most comparable measures as reported in accordance with gaap for the periods presented in the tables attached to this release and should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our

of the selected items impacting comparability    we use derivative instruments for risk management purposes and our related processes include specific identification of hedging instruments to an underlying hedged transaction although we identify an underlying transaction for each derivative instrument we enter into there may not be an accounting hedge relationship between the instrument and the underlying transaction in the course of evaluating our results of operations we identify the earnings that were recognized during the period related to derivative instruments for which the identified underlying transaction does not occur in the current period and exclude the related gains and losses in determining adjusted results in addition we exclude gains and losses on derivatives that are related to investing activities such as the purchase of linefill we also exclude the impact of corresponding inventory valuation adjustments as applicable as well as the marktomarket adjustment related to our preferred distribution rate reset option    we carry approximately  million barrels of crude oil and ngl inventory that is comprised of minimum working inventory requirements in thirdparty assets and other working inventory that is needed for our commercial operations we consider this inventory necessary to conduct our operations and we intend to carry this inventory for the foreseeable future therefore we classify this inventory as longterm on our balance sheet and do not hedge the inventory with derivative instruments similar to linefill in our own assets we treat the impact of changes in the average cost of the longterm inventory that result from fluctuations in market prices and writedowns of such inventory that result from price declines as a selected item impacting comparability    we have certain agreements that require counterparties to deliver transport or throughput a minimum volume over an agreed upon period substantially all of such agreements were entered into with counterparties to economically support the return on our capital expenditure necessary to construct the related asset some of these agreements include makeup rights if the minimum volume is not met we record a receivable from the counterparty in the period that services are provided or when the transaction occurs including amounts for deficiency obligations from counterparties associated with minimum volume commitments if a counterparty has a makeup right associated with a deficiency we defer the revenue attributable to the counterparty’s makeup right and subsequently recognize the revenue at the earlier of when the deficiency volume is delivered or shipped when the makeup right expires or when it is determined that the counterparty’s ability to utilize the makeup right is remote we include the impact of amounts billed to counterparties for their deficiency obligation net of applicable amounts subsequently recognized into revenue as a selected item impacting comparability we believe the inclusion of the contractually committed revenues associated with that period is meaningful to investors as the related asset has been constructed is standing ready to provide the committed service and the fixed operating costs are included in the current period results    our total equityindexed compensation expense includes expense associated

of the outstanding awards is included in our diluted net income per unit calculation and the majority of the awards are expected to be settled in units the portion of compensation expense associated with awards that are certain to be settled in cash is not considered a selected item impacting comparability    during the periods presented there were fluctuations in the value of cad to usd

our principal business strategy is to provide competitive and efficient midstream transportation terminalling storage processing fractionation and supply and logistics services to producers refiners and other customers toward this end we endeavor to address regional supply and demand imbalances for crude oil and ngl in the united states and canada by combining the strategic location and capabilities of our transportation terminalling storage processing and fractionation assets with our supply logistics and distribution expertise we believe successful execution of this strategy will enable us to generate sustainable earnings and cash flow we intend to manage and grow our business by • optimizing our existing assets and realizing cost efficiencies through operational improvements • using our transportation terminalling storage processing and fractionation assets in conjunction with our supply and logistics activities to capture inefficiencies address physical market imbalances mitigate inherent risks and increase margin • developing and implementing growth projects that i address evolving crude oil and ngl needs in the midstream transportation and infrastructure sector and ii are well positioned to benefit from longterm industry trends and opportunities and • selectively pursuing strategic and accretive acquisitions that complement our existing asset base and distribution capabilities competitive strengths we believe that the following competitive strengths position us to successfully execute our principal business strategy • many of our assets are strategically located and operationally flexible the majority of our primary transportation segment assets are in crude oil service are located in wellestablished crude oil producing regions and other transportation corridors and are connected directly or indirectly with our facilities segment assets the majority of our facilities segment assets are located at major trading locations and premium markets that serve as gateways to major north american refinery and distribution markets where we have strong business relationships in addition our assets include pipeline rail barge truck and storage assets which provide our customers and us  table of contents with significant flexibility and optionality to satisfy demand and balance markets particularly during a dynamic period of changing product flows • we possess specialized crude oil and ngl market knowledge  we believe our business relationships with participants in various phases of the crude oil and ngl distribution chain from producers to refiners as well as our own industry expertise including our knowledge of north american crude oil and ngl flows provide us with an extensive understanding of the north american physical crude oil and ngl markets • our supply and logistics activities typically generate a base level of margin with the opportunity to realize incremental margins  we believe the variety of activities executed within our supply and logistics segment in combination with our risk management strategies provides us with a low risk opportunity to generate a base level of margin the amount of which may vary depending on market conditions such as commodity price levels differentials and certain competitive factors in certain market scenarios we may be able to realize incremental margins that meaningfully exceed such base levels • we have the evaluation integration and engineering skill sets and the financial flexibility to continue to pursue acquisition and expansion opportunities since  we have completed and integrated over  acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately  billion including our february  acquisition of the alpha crude connector gathering system since  we have also implemented expansion capital projects totaling approximately  billion in addition considering our investment grade credit rating liquidity and capital structure we believe we have the financial resources and strength necessary to finance future strategic expansion and acquisition opportunities as of december    we had approximately  billion of liquidity available including cash and cash equivalents and availability under our committed credit facilities subject to continued covenant compliance • we have an experienced management team whose interests are aligned with those of our unitholders our executive management team has an average of  years of industry experience and an average of  years with us or our predecessors and affiliates in addition through their ownership of common units grants of phantom units and interests in our general partner including interests in pagp aap units and aap management units our management team has a vested interest in our continued success financial strategy targeted credit profile we believe that a major factor in our continued success is our ability to maintain a competitive cost of capital and access to the capital markets in that regard we intend to maintain a credit profile that we believe is consistent with investment grade credit ratings we have targeted a general credit profile with the following attributes • an average longterm debttototal capitalization ratio of approximately  or less • a longterm debttoadjusted ebitda multiple averaging between x and x adjusted ebitda is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and further adjusted for selected items that impact comparability  see item  “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — nongaap financial measures ” for a discussion of our selected items that impact comparability and our nongaap measures • an average total debttototal capitalization ratio of approximately  or less and • an average adjusted ebitdatointerest coverage multiple of approximately x or better the first two of these four metrics include longterm debt as a critical measure we also incur shortterm debt in connection with our supply and logistics activities that involve the simultaneous purchase and forward sale of crude oil ngl and natural gas the crude oil ngl and natural gas purchased in these transactions are hedged we do not consider the working capital borrowings associated with these activities to be part of our longterm capital structure these borrowings are selfliquidating as they are repaid with sales proceeds we also incur shortterm debt to fund new york mercantile exchange “nymex” and intercontinental exchange “ice” margin requirements in certain market conditions these routine shortterm debt levels may increase significantly above baseline levels for example our shortterm debt levels at december   included borrowings for  million of margin requirements which is significantly elevated from historical levels primarily due to the increase in crude oil prices at the end of the year for the years ended december   and  we had positive cash flow associated with such margin balance activities at the end of the year of  million and  million respectively  table of contents typically to maintain our targeted credit profile and achieve growth through acquisitions and expansion capital we fund approximately  of the capital requirements associated with these activities with equity and cash flow in excess of distributions from time to time we may be outside the parameters of our targeted credit profile as in certain cases capital expenditures and acquisitions may be financed initially using debt or there may be delays in realizing anticipated synergies from acquisitions or contributions from expansion capital projects to adjusted ebitda as a result of the challenging environment and the impact of the gap in the timing between funding our capital program and the time the assets are placed in service and begin to generate cash flow we expect our longterm debttoadjusted ebitda to be above our target range for the nearterm we expect this leverage ratio will improve and return to our targeted levels as we execute our  funding plan complete the  asset sales and as the industry recovers and we realize ebitda growth from our capital investments to improve our ability to manage through the industry downturn and to position for a recovery we completed a number of initiatives during  to maintain a solid capital structure significant liquidity and overall financial flexibility such initiatives included i executing the simplification transactions in november  which lowered our incremental cost of equity through the elimination of our idrs and in connection therewith resetting our distribution level which resulted in an annual reduction in cash distributions of approximately  million ii securing approximately  billion of equity capital through the sale of new series a preferred units in january  iii selectively utilizing our continuous offering program to raise approximately  million of net proceeds iv selling noncore assets and entering into strategic joint ventures which raised approximately  million of net cash proceeds while reducing our capital commitments and v entering into a definitive agreement to sell additional assets for approximately  million that is expected to close in the first half of  subject to regulatory approvals see note  and note  to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these transactions we intend to end  with a longterm debt balance at or below levels at december   to that end we expect that our  acquisition and expansion capital will be funded with proceeds from asset sales equity issuances and retained cash flow acquisitions the acquisition of midstream assets and businesses that are strategic and complementary to our existing operations constitutes an integral component of our business strategy and growth objectives such assets and businesses include crude oil and ngl logistics assets as well as other energy

note  to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our dispositions and divestitures ongoing acquisition divestiture and investment activities consistent with our business strategy we are continuously engaged in the evaluation of potential acquisitions joint ventures and capital projects in addition we continue to evaluate our asset portfolio to determine whether additional sales of noncore assets would further optimize our portfolio and strengthen our balance sheet as a part of these efforts we often engage in discussions with potential third parties regarding the possible purchase of or investment in assets and operations that are strategic and complementary to our existing operations or the potential sale of assets that we believe might have more value to a thirdparty buyer in addition in the past we have evaluated and pursued and intend in the future to evaluate and pursue the acquisition of or investment in other energyrelated assets that have characteristics and provide opportunities similar to our existing business lines and enable us to leverage our assets knowledge and skill sets such efforts may involve participation by us in processes that have been made public and involve a number of potential buyers or investors commonly referred to as “auction” processes as well as situations in which we believe we are the only party or one of a limited number of parties who are in negotiations with the potential seller or other party with respect to a potential divestiture we may also conduct an auction process or may negotiate a transaction with one or a limited number of potential buyers these acquisition and investment efforts often involve assets which if acquired constructed or sold as applicable could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations we typically do not announce a transaction until after we have executed a definitive agreement however in certain cases in order to protect our business interests or for other reasons we may defer public announcement of a transaction until closing or a later date past experience has demonstrated that discussions and negotiations regarding a potential transaction can advance or terminate in a short period of time moreover the closing of any transaction for which we have entered into a definitive agreement may be subject to customary and other closing conditions which may not ultimately be satisfied or waived accordingly we can give no assurance that our current or future acquisition divestiture or investment efforts will be successful although we expect the acquisitions and investments we make to be accretive in the long term we can provide no assurance that our expectations will ultimately be realized see item a “ risk

table of contents global petroleum market overview the health of the global petroleum market is dependent on the relative supply and demand of hydrocarbons including crude oil and ngl these supply and demand economics are greatly influenced by the broader global economic climate exposing the petroleum market to the challenges and volatility associated with global economic development for the period from  through  global liquids production increased  million barrels per day while global liquids consumption increased  million barrels per day for the period from  through  global production growth outpaced global consumption growth by  million barrels per day resulting in a cumulative imbalance of  million barrels per day in  the market remained oversupplied but global demand growth began to

eia’s shortterm energy outlook    amounts may not recalculate due to rounding this surge in liquids production without a commensurate increase in demand has led to a neartomediumterm supply imbalance and increase in inventory which has resulted in a reduction to benchmark petroleum prices producers in turn scaled back capital programs which ultimately reduced supply these outcomes are expected to lead to underinvestment in long lead time projects and additionally stimulate petroleum demand growth which ultimately should lead to an environment where prices will recover to a level to support future production growth in the us in november  opec indicated a desire to return to its historical strategy of managing crude oil production levels joined by certain nonopec countries such as russia and mexico opec and nonopec participants have targeted to cut output by approximately  million barrels per day in the first of half of  this decision drove a significant increase in crude oil prices during the fourth quarter of  to the extent the production cut is executed and demand growth stays on trend accumulated inventories should begin to decline prices should remain firm and potentially rise ultimately leading to increased activity levels crude oil market overview the definition of a commodity is a “massproduced unspecialized product” and implies the attribute of fungibility crude oil is typically referred to as a commodity however it is neither unspecialized nor fungible the crude slate available to us and worldwide refineries consists of a substantial number of different grades and varieties of crude oil each crude oil grade has distinguishing physical properties for example specific gravity generally referred to as light or heavy sulfur content generally referred to as sweet or sour and metals content along with other characteristics collectively result in varying economic attributes in many cases these factors result in the need for such grades to be batched or segregated in the transportation and storage processes blended to precise specifications or adjusted in value the lack of fungibility of the various grades of crude oil creates logistical transportation terminalling and storage challenges and inefficiencies associated with regional volumetric supply and demand imbalances these logistical inefficiencies are created as certain qualities of crude oil are indigenous to particular regions or countries also each refinery has a distinct configuration of process units designed to handle particular grades of crude oil the relative yields and the cost to obtain transport and process the crude oil drives the refinery’s choice of feedstock in addition from time to time natural  table of contents disasters and geopolitical factors such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis inclement weather labor strikes refinery disruptions embargoes and armed conflicts may impact supply demand transportation and storage logistics our assets and our business strategy are designed to serve our producer and refiner customers by addressing regional crude oil supply and demand imbalances that exist in the united states and canada  the nature and extent of these imbalances change from time to time as a result of a variety of factors including regional production declines andor increases refinery expansions modifications and shutdowns available transportation and storage capacity and government mandates and related regulatory factors from  through  the combination of i a significant increase in north american production volumes ii a change in crude oil qualities and related differentials and iii high utilization of existing pipeline and terminal infrastructure stimulated multiple industry initiatives to build new pipeline and terminal infrastructure convert certain pipeline assets to alternative service or reverse flows and expand the use of trucks rail and barges for the movement of crude oil and condensate increased production came from mature producing areas such as the rockies the permian basin in west texas and the midcontinent region as well as from less mature but rapidly growing areas such as the eagle ford shale in south texas and the williston basin in north dakota as a result north american crude oil production increased  million barrels per day or  between  and  with the increases coming primarily from canada the eagle ford shale the permian basin and the williston basin production increases in all of these regions strained existing transportation terminalling and downstream infrastructure this opportunity for new crude oil infrastructure attracted significant investment in midstream oil assets resulting in excess midstream capacity in the permian eagle ford williston midcontinent and dj basins the combination of the slowdown in us crude oil production growth and significant commitments for new infrastructure created an environment in which margins have compressed and differentials are less than transportation cost in some cases as production growth resumes and pipeline utilizations increase differentials should approach transportation cost parity the improvement is expected to occur on a regional basis subject to reductions in excess capacity in addition significant shifts in the type and location of crude oil being produced in north america relative to the types and location of crude oil being produced five years ago have led to changes in the utilization of downstream infrastructure from  through  refiners increased throughputs to take advantage of discounted domestic production which led to lower use of imported crude oil by us refineries this decline in imports was a meaningful change in a multiyear trend where foreign imports of crude oil tripled over an approximately year period from  to  however in  this more recent trend reversed as a result of lower  onshore production declines in  us refinery inputs reached historically high levels fueled by price driven demand growth and exports and us petroleum consumption increased to  million barrels per day the table below shows the overall domestic petroleum consumption projected through  and is derived from the eia

isobutane and natural gasoline and is derived from natural gas production and processing activities as well as crude oil refining processes liquefied petroleum gas “lpg” primarily includes propane and butane which liquefy at moderate pressures thus making it easier to transport and store such products as compared to ethane ngl refers to all ngl products including lpg when used in this form k ngl demand individual ngl products have varying uses  described below are the five basic ngl components and their typical uses • ethane ethane accounts for the largest portion of the ngl barrel and substantially all of the extracted ethane is used as feedstock in the production of ethylene one of the basic building blocks for a wide range of plastics and other chemical products when ethane recovery from a wet natural gas stream is uneconomic ethane is left in the natural gas stream subject to pipeline specifications • propane propane is used as heating fuel engine fuel and industrial fuel for agricultural burning and drying and also as petrochemical feedstock for the production of ethylene and propylene • normal butane normal butane is principally used for motor gasoline blending and as fuel gas either alone or in a mixture with propane and feedstock for the manufacture of ethylene and butadiene a key ingredient of synthetic rubber normal butane is also used as a feedstock for isobutane production and as a diluent in the transportation of heavy crude oil and bitumen particularly in canada • isobutane isobutane is principally used by refiners to produce alkylates to enhance the octane content of motor gasoline • natural gasoline natural gasoline is principally used as a motor gasoline blend stock a petrochemical feedstock or as diluent in the transportation of heavy crude oil and bitumen particularly in canada ngl supply the bulk approximately  of the united states ngl supply comes from gas processing plants which separate a mixture of ngl from the dry gas primarily methane this ngl mix also referred to as “y grade” is then either fractionated at the processing site into the five individual ngl components known as purity products which may be transported stored and sold to end use markets or transported as a ygrade to a regional fractionation facility the majority of gas processing plants in the united states are located along the gulf coast in the west texasoklahoma area the marcellus and utica region and in the rockies region in canada the vast majority of the processing capacity is located in alberta with a much smaller but increasing amount in british columbia and saskatchewan ngl products from refineries represent approximately  of the united states supply and are byproducts of the refinery conversion processes  consequently they have generally already been separated into individual components and do not require further fractionation ngl products from refineries are principally propane with lesser amounts of butane refinery naphthas products similar to natural gasoline and ethane  due to refinery maintenance schedules and seasonal demand considerations refinery production of propane and butane varies on a seasonal basis ngl is also imported into certain regions of the united states from canada and other parts of the world approximately  of total supply ngl primarily propane and butane is also exported from certain regions of the united states ngl transportation and trading hubs ngl whether as a mixture or as purity products is transported by pipelines barges railcars and tank trucks the method of transportation used depends on among other things the resources of the transporter the locations of production points and delivery points costefficiency and the quantity of product being transported pipelines are generally the most costefficient mode of transportation when large consistent volumes of product are to be delivered the major ngl infrastructure and trading hubs in north america are located at mont belvieu texas conway kansas edmonton alberta and sarnia ontario each of these hubs contains a critical mass of infrastructure including fractionators storage pipelines and access to end markets particularly mont belvieu ngl storage ngl must be stored under pressure to maintain a liquid state the lighter the product eg ethane the greater the pressure that must be maintained large volumes of ngl are stored in underground caverns constructed in salt or  table of contents granite however product is also stored in above ground tanks natural gasoline can be stored at relatively low pressures in tankage similar to that used to store motor gasoline propane and butane are stored at much higher pressures in steel spheres cylinders bullets salt caverns or other configurations ethane is stored at very high pressures typically in salt caverns storage is especially important for ngl as supply and demand can vary materially on a seasonal basis ngl market outlook   the growth of shale based production in both traditional and new producing areas has resulted in a significant increase in ngl supplies from gas processing plants over the past several years this has driven extensive expansion and new development of midstream infrastructure in canada the bakken marcellusutica and throughout texas the growth of production in nontraditional producing regions has shifted regional basis relationships and created new logistics and infrastructure opportunities growing ngl production has meant expansion into new markets through exports or increased petrochemical demand  the continuation of a relatively low ratio of north american gas and ngl prices to worldwide crude oil prices will mean north american ngl can continue to be competitive on a world scale either as feedstock for north american based manufacturing or export to overseas markets in addition to substantially increased exports a portion of the increased supply of ngl will be absorbed by the domestic petrochemical sector as lowcost feed stocks as the north american petrochemical industry has enjoyed a supply cost advantage on a world scale while a low price environment may stunt production growth we believe the fundamentals of an accessible resource base and improved midstream infrastructure should mean producers can continue to develop the most economic new supply and be ready to go back to rapid growth as prices recover the ngl market is among other things expected to be driven by • the absolute prices of ngl products and their prices relative to natural gas and crude oil • drilling activity and wet natural gas production in developing liquidsrich production areas • available processing fractionation storage and transportation capacity • petrochemical demand driven by the buildout or new builds of ethylene cracker capacity ethane demand and propane dehydrogenation facilities propane demand • increased export capacity for both ethane and propane • diluent requirements for heavy canadian oil • regulatory changes in gasoline specifications affecting demand for butane • seasonal demand from refiners • seasonal weather related demand and • inefficiencies caused by regional supply and demand imbalances as a result of these and other factors the ngl market is complex and volatile which along with expected market growth creates opportunities to solve the logistical inefficiencies inherent in the business natural gas storage market overview north american natural gas storage facilities provide a staging and warehousing function for seasonal swings in demand relative to supply as well as an essential reliability cushion against disruptions in natural gas supply demand and transportation by allowing natural gas to be injected into withdrawn from or warehoused in such storage facilities as dictated by market conditions natural gas storage serves as the “shock absorber” that balances the market serving as a source of supply to meet the consumption demands in excess of daily production capacity and a warehouse for gas production in excess of daily demand during low demand periods overall market conditions for natural gas storage have been challenging during the last several years driven by a variety of factors including i increased natural gas supplies due to production from shale resources ii a shift from gulf of mexico production to northeast production causing less concern over disruptions from tropical weather and iii lower basis differentials in certain regions due to expansion and improved connectivity of natural gas transportation infrastructure longer term we believe several factors will contribute to meaningful growth in north american natural gas demand that will bolster the market need for and the commercial value of natural gas storage  these fundamental factors include i exports of north american volumes of lng ii increased exports of natural gas to mexico iii construction of new gasfired power plants iv sustained fuel switching from coal to natural gas among existing power plants and v growth in baselevel industrial demand as a result we remain optimistic about the intermediate to longterm intrinsic value of our natural gas storage assets  table of contents description of segments and associated assets our business activities are conducted through three segments—transportation

fort saskatchewan rail terminal which consists of  rack spots capable of loading  cars per day of propane we have initiated projects to add butane loading and condensate offloading capacity at the facility which is expected to be in service in the third quarter of  we also own  operational ngl rail facilities strategically located near ngl storage pipelines gas production or propane distribution centers throughout the united states and canada our ngl rail facilities currently have  railcar rack spots and  railcar storage spots and we have the ability to switch our own railcars at six of these terminals supply and logistics segment our supply and logistics segment operations generally consist of the following merchantrelated activities • the purchase of us and canadian crude oil at the wellhead the bulk purchase of crude oil at pipeline terminal and rail facilities and the purchase of cargos at their load port and various other locations in transit • the storage of inventory during contango market conditions and the seasonal storage of ngl and natural gas • the purchase of ngl from producers refiners processors and other marketers • the resale or exchange of crude oil and ngl at various points along the distribution chain to refiners exporters or other resellers • the transportation of crude oil and ngl on trucks barges railcars pipelines and oceangoing vessels from various delivery points market hub locations or directly to end users such as refineries processors and fractionation facilities and • the purchase and sale of natural gas we generally characterize a portion of our baseline segment results generated by our supply and logistics segment as fee equivalent this portion of the segment results is generated by the purchase and resale of crude oil on an indexrelated basis which results in us generating a gross margin for such activities this gross margin is reduced by the transportation facilities and other logistical costs associated with delivering the crude oil to market as well as any operating and general and administrative expenses the level of results associated with a portion of the other activities we conduct in the supply and logistics segment is influenced by overall market structure and the degree of market volatility as well as variable operating expenses the majority of activities that are carried out within our supply and logistics segment are designed to produce stable  table of contents baseline results in a variety of market conditions while at the same time providing upside potential associated with opportunities inherent in volatile market conditions including opportunities to benefit from fluctuating differentials these activities utilize storage facilities at major interchange and terminalling locations and various hedging strategies the tankage that is used to support our arbitrage activities positions us to capture margins in various market conditions during a transitional market however our supply and logistics segment may not be able to fully recover its costs on certain transactions in order to capture incremental barrels into our overall value chain see “—impact of commodity price volatility and dynamic market conditions on our business model” below for further discussion in addition to hedged working inventories associated with its merchant activities as of december   our supply and logistics segment also owned significant volumes of crude oil and ngl classified as longterm assets and linefill or minimum inventory requirements and employed a variety of owned or leased physical assets throughout the united states and canada including approximately •  million barrels of crude oil and ngl linefill in pipelines owned by us •  million barrels of crude oil and ngl linefill in pipelines owned by third parties and other longterm inventory •  trucks and  trailers and •  crude oil and ngl railcars in connection with its operations our supply and logistics segment secures transportation and facilities services from our other two segments as well as thirdparty service providers under monthtomonth and multiyear arrangements intersegment fees are based on posted tariff rates rates similar to those charged to third parties or rates that we believe approximate market rates however certain terminalling and storage rates recognized within our facilities segment are discounted to our supply and logistics segment to reflect the fact that these services may be canceled on short notice to enable the facilities segment to provide services to third parties generally under longer term arrangements the following table shows the average daily volume of our supply and logistics activities for the year ended december      volumes mbblsd crude oil lease gathering purchases  ngl sales  waterborne cargos  supply and logistics activities total  crude oil and ngl purchases   we purchase crude oil and ngl from multiple producers under contracts and believe that we have established longterm broadbased relationships with the crude oil and ngl producers in our areas of operations our crude oil contracts generally range in term from thirtyday evergreen to five years with the majority ranging from thirty days to one year and a limited number of contracts with remaining terms extending up to nine years we utilize our truck fleet railcars and pipelines as well as leased railcars thirdparty pipelines trucks and barges to transport the crude oil to market from time to time we enter into various types of purchase and exchange transactions including fixed price purchase contracts collars financial swaps and crude oil and nglrelated futures contracts as hedging devices we purchase ngl from producers refiners and other ngl marketing companies under contracts that typically have ranged from immediate delivery to one year in term in the last few years we have implemented an increasing number of contracts with longer terms to ensure capacity utilization and baseload expansion projects we utilize our trucking fleet and pipeline network as well as leased railcars thirdparty tank trucks and thirdparty pipelines to transport ngl in addition to purchasing crude oil from producers we purchase both domestic and foreign crude oil in bulk at major hub locations rail facilities and dock or load port facilities we also purchase ngl in bulk at major pipeline terminal points and storage facilities from major integrated oil companies large independent producers or other ngl marketing companies or processors crude oil and ngl are purchased in bulk when we believe additional opportunities exist to realize margins further downstream in the crude oil or ngl distribution chain the opportunities to earn additional margins vary over time with changing market conditions accordingly the margins associated with our bulk purchases will fluctuate from period to period  table of contents crude oil and ngl sales   the activities involved in the supply logistics and distribution of crude oil and ngl are complex and require current detailed knowledge of crude oil and ngl sources and end markets as well as a familiarity with a number of factors including individual refinery demand for specific grades of crude oil area market price structures location of customers various modes and availability of transportation facilities to deliver crude oil and ngl to our customers we sell our crude oil to major integrated oil companies independent refiners exporters and other resellers in various types of sale and exchange transactions our crude oil sales contracts generally range in term from thirtyday evergreen to five years with the majority ranging from thirty days to one year we sell ngl primarily to propane and refined product retailers petrochemical companies and refiners and limited volumes to other marketers the majority of our ngl contracts generally span a term of one year for contracts greater than one year pricing mechanisms are put in place to ensure any cost escalations are accounted for as well as annual price negotiations occur to ensure both the buyer and seller remain at market based pricing we establish a margin for the crude oil and ngl we purchase by entering into physical sales contracts with third parties or by entering into a future delivery obligation with respect to futures contracts on the nymex ice or overthecounter exchanges through these transactions we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases and sales and future delivery obligations from time to time we enter into various types of sale and exchange transactions including fixed price delivery contracts collars financial swaps and crude oil and nglrelated futures contracts as hedging devices crude oil and ngl exchanges   we pursue exchange opportunities to enhance margins throughout the gathering and marketing process when opportunities arise to increase our margin or to acquire a grade type or volume of crude oil or ngl that more closely matches our physical delivery requirement location or the preferences of our customers we exchange physical crude oil or ngl as appropriate with third parties these exchanges are effected through contracts called exchange or buysell agreements through an exchange agreement we agree to buy crude oil or ngl that differs in terms of geographic location grade of crude oil or type of ngl or physical delivery schedule from crude oil or ngl we have available for sale generally we enter into exchanges to acquire crude oil or ngl at locations that are closer to our end markets thereby reducing transportation costs and increasing our margin we also exchange our crude oil to be physically delivered at a later date if the exchange is expected to result in a higher margin net of storage costs and enter into exchanges based on the grade of crude oil which includes such factors as sulfur content and specific gravity in order to meet the quality specifications of our physical delivery contracts see note  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting for exchange and buysell agreements natural gas purchase and sales activities we also generate net revenue through the merchant storage activities of our natural gas commercial marketing group which captures short term market opportunities by utilizing a portion of our natural gas storage capacity and engaging in related commercial marketing activities our natural gas merchant storage activities generate revenue through the hedged purchase and sale of natural gas net of any storagerelated costs incurred we utilize physical natural gas storage at our facilities and derivatives to hedge expected margin from these activities through these transactions we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases of natural gas on the one hand and sales or future delivery obligations on the other hand credit   our merchant activities involve the purchase of crude oil ngl and natural gas for resale and require significant extensions of credit by our suppliers in order to assure our ability to perform our obligations under the purchase agreements various credit arrangements are negotiated with our suppliers these arrangements include open lines of credit and to a lesser extent standby letters of credit issued under our hedged inventory facility or our senior unsecured revolving credit facility when we sell crude oil ngl and natural gas we must determine the amount if any of the line of credit to be extended to any given customer we manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis credit approvals credit limits prepayment letters of credit and monitoring procedures because our typical sales transactions can involve large volumes of crude oil and natural gas the risk of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers is a major consideration in our business we believe our sales are made to creditworthy entities or entities with adequate credit support generally sales of crude oil and natural gas are settled within  days of the month of delivery and pipeline transportation and terminalling services settle within  days from the date we issue an invoice for the provision of services we also have credit risk exposure related to our sales of ngl principally propane however because our sales are typically in relatively small amounts to individual customers we do not believe that these transactions pose a material concentration of credit risk typically we enter into annual contracts to sell ngl on a forward basis as well as to sell ngl on a current basis to local distributors and retailers in certain cases our ngl customers prepay for their purchases in amounts ranging up to  of their contracted amounts  table of contents certain activities in our supply and logistics segment are affected by seasonal aspects primarily with respect to ngl and natural gas supply and logistics activities impact of commodity price volatility and dynamic market conditions on our business model through our three business segments we are engaged in the transportation storage terminalling and marketing of crude oil ngl and natural gas the majority of our activities are focused on crude oil which is the principal feedstock used by refineries in the production of transportation fuels crude oil ngl and natural gas commodity prices have historically been very volatile for example since the mids nymex west texas intermediate “wti” crude oil benchmark prices have ranged from a low of approximately  per barrel during  to a high of over  per barrel during  during  wti crude oil prices traded within a range of approximately  to  per barrel there is also volatility within the propane and butane markets as seen through the north american benchmark price located at mont belvieu texas specifically propane prices have ranged from a low of approximately  of the wti benchmark price for crude oil in  to a high of approximately  of the wti benchmark price for crude oil in   butane has seen a price range from a low of approximately  of the wti benchmark price for crude oil in  to a high of approximately  of the wti benchmark price for crude oil in  absent extended periods of lower crude oil or ngl prices that are below production replacement costs or higher crude oil or ngl prices that have a significant adverse impact on consumption demand for the services we provide in our feebased transportation and facilities segments and our financial results from these activities have little correlation to absolute commodity prices relative contribution levels will vary from quartertoquarter due to seasonal and other similar factors but we project that our feebased transportation and facilities segments should comprise approximately  or greater of our aggregate base level segment results base level segment results from our supply and logistics activities is dependent on our ability to sell crude oil and ngl at prices in excess of our aggregate cost although segment results may be adversely affected during certain transitional periods as discussed further below our crude oil and ngl supply logistics and distribution operations are not directly affected by the absolute level of prices but are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for crude oil and ngl and relative fluctuations in marketrelated indices in developing our business model and allocating our resources among our three segments we attempt to anticipate the impacts of shifts between supplydriven markets and demanddriven markets seasonality cyclicality regional surpluses and shortages economic conditions and a number of other influences that can cause volatility and change market dynamics on a short intermediate and longterm basis our objective is to position the partnership such that our overall annual base level of cash flow is not materially adversely affected by the absolute level of energy prices shifts between demanddriven markets and supplydriven markets or other similar dynamics beginning in the second half of  to present however the market has experienced impacts from aggressive competition and overbuilt infrastructure in certain regions which has caused supply and demand imbalances and price volatility in some of the areas where we operate there has been significantly increased competition for marginal or incremental volumes from shippers on third party pipelines who have committed to ship more production than they have and are purchasing barrels in the market for shipment on the applicable third party pipeline in satisfaction of their transportation commitments often doing so at a loss because the loss on sale of the purchased crude oil will be less than the amount of the takeorpay obligation on the pipeline this type of activity has put downward pressure on volumes and margins across our three business segments this transitioning crude oil market presents challenges to both us and the overall midstream industry and while we believe our integrated business model and diversification of our asset base among varying regions and demanddriven and supplydriven markets gives us competitive advantages we may see a lower level of cash flow than we would have otherwise experienced in addition increased competition and compressed differentials may drive lower volumes and lower unit margins in parts of our business particularly our supply and logistics segment also during such transitional markets our supply and logistics segment may not be able to fully recover its costs on certain transactions in order to capture incremental barrels into our overall value chain creating the opportunity to provide profitability at the company level  table of contents while recent market conditions have been challenging we believe the complementary integrated nature of our business activities and diversification of our asset base among varying regions and demanddriven and supplydriven markets generally provides us with the opportunity to generate a base level of cash flow in a variety of market scenarios in addition to providing the opportunity to generate a base level of cash flow this approach is also intended to provide opportunities to realize incremental margin during volatile market conditions for example if crude oil prices are high relative to historical levels we may hedge some of our expected pipeline loss allowance barrels and if crude oil prices are low relative to historical prices we may hedge a portion of our anticipated diesel purchases needed to operate our trucks and barges  also during periods when supply exceeds the demand for crude oil ngl or natural gas in the near term the market for such product is often in contango meaning that the price for future deliveries is higher than current prices in a contango market entities that have access to storage at major trading locations can purchase crude oil ngl or natural gas at current prices for storage and simultaneously sell forward such products for future delivery at higher prices the combination of feebased cash flow from our transportation and facilities segments complemented by a number of diverse flexible and generally counterbalanced sources of cash flow within our supply and logistics segment is intended to provide us with the opportunity to generate a base level of cash flow and provide upside opportunities  in executing this business model we employ a variety of financial risk management tools and techniques predominantly in our supply and logistics segment during certain transitional periods such as this extended period of lower crude oil prices the ability to generate above base line performance is challenging and taking into account the overcapacity of midstream assets that currently exists in most crude oil producing regions generating even baseline level performance will be challenging see “ global petroleum market overview ” above for additional discussion regarding market conditions risk management in order to hedge margins involving our physical assets and manage risks associated with our various commodity purchase and sale obligations and in certain circumstances to realize incremental margin during volatile market conditions we use derivative instruments we also use various derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk in analyzing our risk management activities we draw a distinction between enterprise level risks and tradingrelated risks enterprise level risks are those that underlie our core businesses and may be managed based on management’s assessment of the cost or benefit in doing so conversely tradingrelated risks the risks involved in trading in the hopes of generating an increased return are not inherent in our core business rather those risks arise as a result of engaging in the trading activity our policy is to manage the enterprise level risks inherent in our core businesses rather than trying to profit from trading activity our commodity risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor nymex ice and over the counter positions as well as physical volumes grades locations delivery schedules and storage capacity to help ensure that our hedging activities address our risks our interest rate and currency exchange rate risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor our derivative positions and ensure that those positions are consistent with our objectives and approved strategies we have a risk management function that has direct responsibility and authority for our risk policies related controls around commercial activities and procedures and certain other aspects of corporate risk management our risk management function also approves all new risk management strategies through a formal process our approved strategies are intended to mitigate and manage enterprise level risks that are inherent in our core businesses our policy is generally to structure our purchase and sales contracts so that price fluctuations do not materially affect our operating income and not to acquire and hold physical inventory or derivatives for the purpose of speculating on outright commodity price changes although we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our supply and logistics activities we purchase crude oil ngl and natural gas from thousands of locations and may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of production transportation and delivery variances as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions and other uncontrollable events that may occur when unscheduled physical inventory builds or draws do occur they are monitored constantly and managed to a balanced position over a reasonable period of time this activity is monitored independently by our risk management function and must take place within predefined limits and authorizations  table of contents geographic data financial information about segments see note  to our consolidated financial statements customers marathon petroleum corporation and its subsidiaries accounted for   and  of our revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively exxonmobil corporation and its subsidiaries accounted for   and  of our revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively phillips  company and its subsidiaries accounted for  of our revenues for the year ended december   no other customers accounted for  or more of our revenues during any of the three years ended december   the majority of revenues from these customers pertain to our supply and logistics operations the sales to these customers occur at multiple locations and we believe that the loss of these customers would have only a shortterm impact on our operating results there is risk however that we would not be able to identify and access a replacement market at comparable margins  for a discussion of customers and industry concentration risk see note  to our consolidated financial statements competition competition among pipelines is based primarily on transportation charges access to producing areas and supply regions and demand for crude oil and ngl by end users we believe that high capital requirements environmental considerations and the difficulty in acquiring rightsofway and related permits together with the fact that many of the producing basins in the united states and canada currently have excess takeaway capacity whether by pipeline or rail generally make it less likely that new competing pipeline systems comparable in size and scope to our larger pipeline systems and excluding those already publicly announced to be under development or construction will limit the number of new pipeline projects over the next few years however there are currently thirdparty owned pipelines or owners with joint venture pipelines with excess capacity in the vicinity of our operations that expose us to significant competition based on the relatively low cost of moving an incremental barrel of crude oil or ngl in the current environment such competition for marginal or incremental volumes has been exacerbated in some areas by shippers on third party pipelines who have committed to ship more production than they own or have secured under contract and are purchasing barrels in the market and shipping them on the applicable third party pipeline in satisfaction of their transportation commitment this type of activity reduces the pool of incremental barrels that would otherwise be available for transport on our pipelines in addition in areas where additional infrastructure is necessary to accommodate new or increased production or changing product flows we face competition in providing the required infrastructure solutions as well as the risk of building capacity in excess of sustained demand depending upon the specific movement pipelines which generally offer the lowest cost of transportation may also face competition from other forms of transportation such as rail and barge although these alternative forms of transportation are typically higher cost they can provide access to alternative markets at which a higher price may be realized for the commodity being transported thereby overcoming the increased transportation cost we also face competition with respect to our supply and logistics and facilities services our competitors include other crude oil and ngl pipeline and terminalling companies other ngl processing and fractionation companies the major integrated oil companies and their marketing affiliates independent gatherers private equity backed entities banks that have established a trading platform brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes financial resources and experience some of these competitors have capital resources greater than ours with respect to our natural gas storage operations the principal elements of competition are rates terms of service supply and market access and flexibility of service an increase in competition in our markets could arise from new ventures or expanded operations from existing competitors  our natural gas storage facilities compete with several other storage providers including regional storage facilities and utilities certain pipeline companies have existing storage facilities connected to their systems that compete with some of our facilities  table of contents regulation our assets operations and business activities are subject to extensive legal requirements and regulations under the jurisdiction of numerous federal state provincial and local agencies many of these agencies are authorized by statute to issue and have issued requirements binding on the pipeline industry related businesses and individual participants the failure to comply with such legal requirements and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties expose us to civil and criminal claims and cause us to incur significant costs and expenses in all material respects we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the various laws rules and regulations that apply to our assets operations and business activities however we can provide no assurances in that regard see item a “ risk factors — risks related to our business — our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and wildlife operational safety climate change and related matters that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities ” at any given time there may be proposals provisional rulings or proceedings in legislation or under governmental agency or court review that could affect our business the regulatory burden on our assets operations and activities increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability we can provide no assurance that the increased costs associated with any new or proposed laws rules or regulations will not be material we may at any time also be required to apply significant resources in responding to governmental requests for information andor enforcement actions the following is a discussion of certain but not all of the laws and regulations affecting our operations environmental health and safety regulation general our operations involving the storage treatment processing and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons including crude oil are subject to stringent federal state provincial and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment as with the industry generally compliance with these laws and regulations increases our overall cost of doing business including our capital costs to construct maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities and the issuance of injunctions that may subject us to additional operational constraints environmental and safety laws and regulations are subject to changes that may result in more stringent requirements and we cannot provide any assurance that compliance with current and future laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our results of operations or earnings a discharge of hazardous liquids into the environment could to the extent such event is not insured subject us to substantial expense including both the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and any claims made by third parties the following is a summary of some of the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which our operations are subject pipeline safetyintegrity management a substantial portion of our petroleum pipelines and our storage tank facilities in the united states are subject to regulation by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” pursuant to the hazardous liquids pipeline safety act of  as amended the “hlpsa” the hlpsa imposes safety requirements on the design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of pipeline and tank facilities federal regulations implementing the hlpsa require pipeline operators to adopt measures designed to reduce the environmental impact of oil discharges from onshore oil pipelines including the maintenance of comprehensive spill response plans and the performance of extensive spill response training for pipeline personnel these regulations also require pipeline operators to develop and maintain a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities comparable regulation exists in some states in which we conduct intrastate common carrier or private pipeline operations regulation in canada is under the national energy board “neb” and provincial agencies united states the hlpsa was amended by the pipeline safety improvement act of  and the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of  these amendments have resulted in the adoption of rules by the department of transportation “dot” that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs including frequent inspections correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in “high consequence areas” such as high population areas areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways in the united states our costs associated with the inspection testing and correction of identified anomalies were approximately  million in    million in  and  million in   based on currently available information our preliminary estimate for  is that we will incur approximately  million in capital expenditures and approximately  table of contents  million in operational expenditures associated with our required pipeline integrity management program significant additional expenses could be incurred if new or more stringently interpreted pipeline safety requirements are implemented in addition to required activities our integrity management program includes several voluntary multiyear initiatives designed to prevent incidents costs incurred for such activities were approximately  million in    million in  and  million in   and our preliminary estimate for  is that we will incur approximately  million of such costs in  the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of  the “ act” became effective under the  act maximum civil penalties for certain violations have been increased from  to  per violation per day and from a total cap of  million to  million in addition the  act reauthorized the federal pipeline safety programs of phmsa through september   and directs the secretary of transportation to undertake a number of reviews studies and reports some of which may result in additional natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline safety rulemaking a number of the provisions of the  act have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures andor operating costs the securing america’s future energy protecting infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act “safe pipes act” was signed into law on june   this bill imposes a number of requirements on the industry and phmsa but the key provisions include i reauthorization of phmsa through fiscal year  ii requirements for reports to congress on the status of rulemaking efforts and certain specific information gathering efforts iii a requirement that phmsa initiate new rulemaking for underground natural gas storage facilities iv a requirement to convene a work group on the development of a voluntary information sharing program and v the granting of authority to the dot to issue industrywide emergency orders under certain circumstances the pending rulemaking efforts that are required by the safe pipes act and that could materially affect the operation of pipeline operators include i expansion of integrity management programs beyond highconsequence areas ii additional regulation of pipeline leak detection systems and iii the use of shutoff valves and excess flow valves in certain applications we will monitor the rulemaking resulting from the safe pipes act as well as the reports phmsa is obligated to provide to congress to better understand the potential impact to our operations at this time we cannot predict the full impact to our operations or the potential additional cost of compliance in october  phmsa published a notice of proposed rulemaking “nprm” in the federal register proposing to make changes to the hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations  phmsa is proposing to make the following changes to the regulations • extend reporting requirements to all hazardous liquid gravity and gathering lines • require inspections of pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather natural disasters and other similar events and periodic inline integrity assessments of pipelines that are located outside of high consequence areas of at least once every ten years • use of leak detection systems on hazardous liquid pipelines in all locations • modify the provisions for making pipeline repairs • require that all pipelines subject to the integrity management requirements be capable of accommodating inline inspection tools within  years and • clarifications to improve certainty and compliance to certain existing regulations phmsa announced the regulatory text of the final rule on january   however the complete text was not published in the federal register prior to the regulatory freeze put in place by the incoming administration on january   the regulatory freeze was instituted to allow the incoming administration the opportunity to review all pending rules the rule will go into effect six months after publication in the federal register we do not currently believe this rule will have a significant adverse financial impact on our operations if approved by phmsa states may assume responsibility for enforcing federal interstate pipeline regulations as agents for phmsa and conduct inspections of interstate pipelines in practice states vary in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety  table of contents the california governor signed into law the following three bills on october   related to pipeline safety • the oil spill response bill allows volunteer cleanup crews to be paid as contractors requires oil skimmers to be placed along the coastline at all times and prohibits the use of dispersants until the epa issues rules on dispersant safety • the pipeline safety inspections bill sb  mandates annual pipeline inspections commencing january   with the state fire marshal responsible for annually inspecting all intrastate pipelines and operators of intrastate pipelines under the jurisdiction of the state fire marshal • the oil spill response environmentally and ecologically sensitive areas bill ab  requires automatic shutoffs for pipelines located in environmentally sensitive areas the sb  rulemaking efforts were completed in  and the annual pipeline inspection requirements commence in  efforts to draft and implement regulations to adopt the provisions of ab  continue and are expected to be finalized by july  we cannot currently predict the impact and costs of these new laws and any associated regulations on our operations the dot has issued guidelines with respect to securing regulated facilities against terrorist attack we have instituted security measures and procedures in accordance with such guidelines to enhance the protection of certain of our facilities we cannot provide any assurance that these security measures would fully protect our facilities from an attack the dot has adopted american petroleum institute standard  “api ” as the standard for the inspection repair alteration and reconstruction of steel aboveground petroleum storage tanks subject to dot jurisdiction api  requires regularly scheduled inspection and repair of tanks remaining in service in the united states our costs associated with this program were approximately  million  million and  million in    and   respectively for   we have budgeted approximately  million in connection with continued api  compliance activities and similar new epa regulations for tanks not regulated by the dot certain storage tanks may be taken out of service if we believe the cost of compliance will exceed the value of the storage tanks or replacement tankage may be constructed canada in canada the neb and provincial agencies such as the alberta energy regulator “aer” and the saskatchewan ministry of economy regulate the safety and integrity management of pipelines and storage tanks used for hydrocarbon transmission we have incurred and will continue to incur costs related to such regulatory requirements the pipeline safety act sc  c  the “pipeline safety act” or the “act” came into force in june  amending the national energy board act and the canada oil and gas operations act in order to strengthen the safety and security of pipelines regulated under those acts it reinforces the “polluter pays” principle such that operators of pipelines are liable for costs and damages for all unintended or uncontrolled releases of oil gas or other substances the act introduces absolute liability for costs and damages up to  billion from an uncontrolled release of oil gas or other commodity from a major pipeline ie those with capacity over  barrels per day additionally operators will be required to maintain the financial resources necessary to meet the applicable absolute liability obligations imposed under the act finally the act imposes requirements with respect to abandoned pipelines including an obligation to maintain adequate funds to pay for abandonment costs the total transport capacity of our pipelines regulated by the neb exceeds  barrels per day so financial instruments in the form of lines of credit and insurance verification were filed with the neb the pipeline safety act also amended the pipeline damage prevention provisions of the national energy board act and regulations for pipeline damage prevention came in effect june  potential operational requirements and costs may be incurred around depth of cover information and mitigation with landowners crossings and encroachments turnaround timelines for responding to dig requests near pipelines and land use monitoring for adjacent lands to the pipeline rightofway the cost impact of the pipeline safety act on us is not expected to be material in addition to required activities our canadian integrity management program includes several voluntary multiyear programs designed to prevent incidents such as upgrades to our operating and maintenance programs and systems and upgrades to our pipeline watercourse crossing integrity program between such required and elective activities we spent approximately  million  million and  million in    and   respectively our preliminary estimate for  is approximately  million  table of contents we cannot predict the potential costs associated with additional future regulation significant additional expenses could be incurred and additional operational requirements and constraints could be imposed if new or more stringently interpreted pipeline safety requirements are implemented occupational safety and health united states in the united states we are subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health act as amended “osha” and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers in addition the osha hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees state and local government authorities and citizens certain of our facilities are subject to osha process safety management “psm” regulations which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic reactive flammable or explosive chemicals  these regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above specified thresholds or any process that involves  pounds or more of a flammable liquid or gas in one location canada similar regulatory requirements exist in canada under the federal and provincial occupational health and safety acts regulations and codes the agencies with jurisdiction under these regulations are empowered to enforce them through inspection audit incident investigation or investigation of a public or employee complaint  in some jurisdictions the agencies have been empowered to administer penalties for contraventions without the company first being prosecuted additionally under the criminal code of canada organizations corporations and individuals may be prosecuted criminally for violating the duty to protect employee and public safety solid waste we generate wastes including hazardous wastes which are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act as amended “rcra” and analogous state and provincial laws many of the wastes that we generate are not subject to the most stringent requirements of rcra because our operations generate primarily oil and gas wastes which currently are excluded from consideration as rcra hazardous wastes it is possible however that in the future oil and gas waste under rcra may be revisited and our wastes subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements resulting in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for example in december  the epa and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the epa’s alleged failure to timely assess its rcra subtitle d criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from rcra regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra the consent decree requires the epa to propose a rulemaking no later than march   for revision of certain subtitle d criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary hazardous substances the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended “cercla” also known as “superfund” and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original act on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment these persons include the owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site such persons may be subject to strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment in the course of our ordinary operations we may generate waste that falls within cercla’s definition of a “hazardous substance”  canadian federal and provincial laws also impose liabilities for releases of certain substances into the environment we are subject to the epa’s risk management plan regulations at certain facilities these regulations are intended to work with osha’s psm regulations see “—occupational safety and health” above to minimize the offsite consequences of catastrophic releases the regulations require us to develop and implement a risk management program that includes a fiveyear accident history an offsite consequence analysis process a prevention program and an emergency response program in march  the epa proposed revisions to the risk management plan “rmp” rules including requirements for the use of third  table of contents party compliance audits root cause analyses for facilities that experience releases process hazard analyses and enhanced informationsharing provisions osha has announced that it is considering similar revisions to the psm rule but to date has not issued an nprm environmental remediation we currently own or lease and in the past have owned or leased properties where hazardous liquids including hydrocarbons are or have been handled these properties may be subject to cercla rcra and state and canadian federal and provincial laws and regulations under such laws and regulations we could be required to remove or remediate hazardous liquids or associated wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators and to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater we maintain insurance of various types with varying levels of coverage that we consider adequate under the circumstances to cover our operations and properties the insurance policies are subject to deductibles and retention levels that we consider reasonable and not excessive consistent with insurance coverage generally available in the industry in certain circumstances our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to gradual pollution with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences assets we have acquired or will acquire in the future may have environmental remediation liabilities for which we are not indemnified we have in the past experienced and in the future may experience releases of crude oil into the environment from our pipeline and storage operations we may also discover environmental impacts from past releases that were previously unidentified air emissions our united states operations are subject to the united states clean air act “clean air act” comparable state laws and associated state and federal regulations in october  the epa promulgated a revised national ambient air standard for ozone while full implementation of the standard may take a number of years the revised standard could make air permits for sources of volatile organic compounds such as crude oil tank farms more difficult to obtain in some areas in addition in june  the epa finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for airquality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry this rule could cause small facilities on an aggregate basis to be deemed a major source thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and control requirements our canadian operations are subject to federal and provincial air emission regulations new canadian standards for air quality and industrial air emissions were implemented in may  the new standards provide more stringent objectives for outdoor air quality including a long term annual target for fine particulate matter under these laws permits may be required before construction can commence on a new or modified source of potentially significant air emissions and operating permits may be required for sources already constructed as a result of the changing requirements in both canada and the united states such as those mentioned above we may be required to incur certain capital and operating expenditures in the next several years to install air pollution control equipment and otherwise comply with more stringent federal state provincial and regional air emissions control requirements when we attempt to obtain or maintain permits and approvals for sources of air emissions we can provide no assurance that future compliance obligations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations climate change initiatives united states the epa has adopted rules for the reporting of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases “ghg” from certain sources  fewer than ten of our facilities are presently subject to the federal ghg reporting requirements  these include facilities with combustion ghg emissions and potential fugitive emissions above the reporting thresholds  we import sufficient quantities of finished fuel products into the united states to be required to report that activity as well  we also continue to monitor ghg emissions for our facilities and activities the epa has also promulgated regulations establishing title v and prevention of significant deterioration permitting requirements for certain large sources of ghgs fewer than ten of our existing facilities are potential major sources of ghg subject to these permitting requirements we may be required to install “best available control technology” “bact” to limit emissions of ghgs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they emit  table of contents quantities of ghgs that trigger the requirements of these regulations for facilities such as ours bact will normally take the form of enhanced energy efficiency measures rather than postcombustion ghg capture requirements we do not anticipate that the imposition of enhanced energy efficiency requirements will have a material adverse effect on the cost of our operations in june  the epa finalized regulations affecting new modified and reconstructed sources of air emissions in the oil and natural gas sector that require significant reductions in fugitive methane emissions from certain upstream and midstream oil and gas facilities these new rules also require operators to implement fugitive emission leak detection and repair requirements for compressor stations we do not expect the cost of complying with these rules to have a material effect on the cost of our operations california has implemented a ghg capandtrade program authorized under assembly bill  “ab” through  california’s capandtrade program has only applied to large industrial facilities the california air resources board has published a list of facilities that are subject to this program at this time the list only includes one of our facilities the lone star gas liquids facility in shafter california because it is a significant combustion source as a result compliance instruments for ghg emissions have been purchased since  on january   the ab regulations for the first time covered finished fuel providers and importers california finished fuels providers refiners and importers were required to purchase ghg emission credits for finished fuel sold in or imported into california plains marketing was included in this portion of the regulation due to propane imports and completed its first year of compliance in  the rules implementing the ab program were finalized in december  the compliance requirements of the ghg capandtrade program through  are being phased in the california air resources board is currently developing a scoping plan for ab compliance obligations after the year  we will be reporting associated ghg emissions for finished fuels imported and exported across california borders and will be subject to the cap and trade program in  executive order b was signed by california’s governor in midyear  this executive order requires a  reduction in ghg emissions from the  baseline level by  the current  goals for ghg emissions reductions are at  below the  baseline level  compliance with this reduction requirement may necessitate the lowering of the threshold for industrial facilities required to participate in the ghg cap and trade program  this may increase the number of paa facilities subject to this program the operations of our refinery and producer customers could also be negatively impacted by current ghg legislation or new regulations resulting in increased operating or compliance costs  some of the proposed federal and state “capandtrade” legislation would require businesses that emit ghgs to buy emission credits from government other businesses or through an auction process  in addition refiners could be required to purchase emission credits for ghg emissions resulting from their refining operations as well as the fuels they sell  while it is not possible at this time to predict the final form of “capandtrade” legislation any new federal or state restrictions on ghg emissions could result in material increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions and an increase in the cost of feedstock and products produced by our refinery customers in december  the paris agreement was signed at the  st annual conference of parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change “unfccc”  the paris agreement which came into effect in november  requires signatory parties to develop and implement carbon emission reduction policies with a goal of limiting the rise in average global temperatures to °c or less this agreement is likely to become a significant driver for future potential ghg reduction programs in the united states and canada although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions and could have a material adverse effect on our business demand for our services financial condition results of operations and cash flows canada federal regulations along with  other countries canada is a signatory to the unfccc “durban platform” committing it to develop a legally binding agreement to reduce ghg emissions by  since  large emitters of ghg were required to report their emissions under the canadian greenhouse gas emissions reporting program three pmc facilities meet the current kty reporting threshold  table of contents the federal department of environment and climate change is proposing to lower the reporting threshold for all facilities from kty to  kty the enactment of this proposal would result in more pmc facilities being required to prepare annual reports of their emissions the associated costs with this requirement would not be considered material in october  the government of canada proposed a pancanadian approach to pricing carbon pollution requiring all canadian provinces and territories to have carbon pricing in place by  the provinces and territories will have flexibility in deciding how they implement carbon pricing either by placing a direct price on carbon pollution or adopting a capandtrade system the price on carbon pollution will start at tonne in  and rise by  a year to reach tonne in  provincial regulations ontario  in february  the ontario ministry of environment and climate change issued a discussion paper that identified carbon pricing as a critical action necessary to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in april  the ontario government announced it would be implementing a ghg cap and trade program which would be implemented through the western climate initiative wci which includes quebec and california mandatory participants for the program will be responsible for their emissions starting on january   pmc’s facility at sarnia is considered to be a mandatory participant in the program threshold  tonnes ghg emissions at this early stage of the program it is not possible to predict any material increases in compliance costs or additional operating restrictions alberta the alberta climate change and emissions management act provides a framework for managing ghg emissions by reducing specified gas emissions to  of  levels by december   the accompanying specified gas emitters regulation imposes ghg emissions limits on large emitters and requires reductions in ghg emissions intensity since the regulation came into effect pmc has two facilities fort saskatchewan storage and fractionation facility and empress vi which currently do not meet the reduction obligation as such pmc has been required to submit compliance payments to the climate change emissions management fund the “ccemc” ccemc will increase from  per tonne from  in  of co  over a facility’s budget in  which will increase our operating costs at these two facilities on may   the government of alberta introduced bill  the climate leadership implementation act which implements a carbon levy on alberta businesses previously announced under the plan subject to certain exemptions the act applies a carbon levy to all sales and imports of fuel pmc has registered and received specific exemptions for its alberta facilities until january   the combined effect of these alberta climate change enactments is not expected to be material saskatchewan the management and reduction of greenhouse gases act received royal assent on may   and set  ghg emission reduction targets below  levels by  but no regulations to implement the targets have been passed by the provincial government to date the provincial government continues discussions with the federal government on implementation water the us federal water pollution control act as amended also known as the clean water act “cwa” and analogous state and canadian federal and provincial laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters of the united states and canada as well as state and provincial waters see “—pipeline safetyintegrity management” above and note  to our consolidated financial statements federal state and provincial regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the cwa the us oil pollution act of  “opa” amended certain provisions of the cwa as they relate to the release of petroleum products into navigable waters opa subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and potentially unlimited liability for containment and removal costs natural resource damages and certain other consequences of an oil spill state and canadian federal and provincial laws also impose requirements relating to the prevention of oil releases and the remediation of areas affected by releases when they occur with respect to our new pipeline construction activities and maintenance on our existing pipelines section  of the cwa authorizes the army corps of engineers “corps” to permit the discharge of dredged or fill materials into “navigable waters” which are defined as “the waters of the united states” section e authorizes the corps to issue permits on a nationwide basis for categories of discharges that have no more than minimal individual or cumulative environmental effects   table of contents for over  years the corps has authorized construction maintenance and repair of pipelines under a streamlined nationwide permit program known as nationwide permit  “nwp” the nwp program is supported by strong statutory and regulatory history and was originally approved by congress in  from time to time environmental groups have challenged the nwp program however to date federal courts have upheld the validity of nwp program under the cwa we cannot predict whether future lawsuits will be filed to contest the validity of nwp however in the event that a court wholly or partially strikes down the nwp program which we believe to be unlikely we could face significant delays and financial costs when seeking project approvals from the corps in may  the epa published a final rule that attempted to clarify federal jurisdiction under the cwa over waters of the united states but a number of legal challenges to this rule are pending and implementation of the rule has been stayed nationwide to the extent the rule expands the scope of the cwa’s jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas the corps completed their fiveyear review and update of the nwps in  publishing the final version of the revised nwps in the federal register on january   the revised nwps will be effective on march   changes to nwp  which applies to linear projects such as pipelines could impact both the time to obtain project authorization under nwp  and the cost to comply with the revised conditions endangered species new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal state and provincial laws including the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act in the united states and the species at risk act in canada the resulting costs and liabilities associated with lengthy regulatory review and approval requirements could materially and negatively affect the viability of such projects other regulation transportation regulation our transportation activities are subject to regulation by multiple governmental agencies our historical operating costs reflect the recurring costs resulting from compliance with these regulations the following is a summary of the types of transportation regulation that may impact our operations general interstate regulation in the united states   our interstate common carrier liquids pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act “ica” the ica requires that tariff rates for liquids pipelines which include both crude oil pipelines and refined products pipelines be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory state regulation in the united states   our intrastate liquids pipeline transportation activities are subject to various state laws and regulations as well as orders of state regulatory bodies including the railroad commission of texas “trrc” and the california public utility commission “cpuc” the cpuc prohibits certain of our subsidiaries from acting as guarantors of our senior notes and credit facilities us energy policy act of  and subsequent developments   in october  congress passed the energy policy act of  “epact” which among other things required the ferc to issue rules to establish a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for petroleum pipelines and to streamline procedures in petroleum pipeline proceedings the ferc responded to this mandate by establishing a formulaic methodology for petroleum pipelines to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index the ferc reviews the formula every five years effective july   the annual index adjustment for the five year period ending june   will equal the producer price index for finished goods for the applicable year plus an adjustment factor of  pipelines may raise their rates to the rate ceiling level generated by application of the annual index adjustment factor each year however a shipper may challenge such increase if the increase in the pipeline’s rates was substantially in excess of the actual cost increases incurred by the pipeline during the relevant year if the ferc’s annual index adjustment reduces the ceiling level such that it is lower than a pipeline’s filed rate the pipeline must reduce its rate to conform with the lower ceiling unless doing so would reduce a rate “grandfathered” by the epact see below to below the grandfathered level a pipeline must as a general rule use the indexing methodology to change its rates the ferc however retained costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates as alternatives to the indexing approach that may be used in certain specified circumstances because the indexing methodology for the next fiveyear period is tied to an inflation index and is not based on pipelinespecific costs the indexing methodology could hamper our ability to recover cost increases  table of contents under the epact petroleum pipeline rates in effect for the day period ending on the date of enactment of epact are deemed to be just and reasonable under the ica if such rates had not been subject to complaint protest or investigation during such day period generally complaints against such “grandfathered” rates may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of epact in either the economic circumstances of the oil pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate epact places no such limit on challenges to a provision of an oil pipeline tariff as unduly discriminatory or preferential pipeline rate regulation in the united states  the ferc historically has not investigated rates of liquids pipelines on its own initiative when those rates have not been the subject of a protest or complaint by a shipper the majority of our transportation segment profit in the united states is produced by rates that are either grandfathered or set by agreement with one or more shippers ferc issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on october   that addressed issues related to ferc’s indexing methodology and liquids pipeline reporting practices if implemented the proposals in this rulemaking could affect the profitability of certain liquids pipelines on december   ferc issued a notice of inquiry regarding certain matters related to ferc’s income tax allowance policy parties are currently submitting comments in response to this notice and ferc could after review of those comments decide to propose changes to its current policy canadian regulation   our canadian pipeline assets are subject to regulation by the neb and by provincial authorities such as the aer with respect to a pipeline over which it has jurisdiction the relevant regulatory authority has the power upon application by a third party to determine the rates we are allowed to charge for transportation on and set other terms of access to such pipeline in such circumstances if the relevant regulatory authority determines that the applicable terms and conditions of service are not just and reasonable the regulatory authority can impose conditions it considers appropriate trucking regulation united states we operate a fleet of trucks to transport crude oil and oilfield materials as a private contract and common carrier we are licensed to perform both intrastate and interstate motor carrier services as a motor carrier we are subject to certain safety regulations issued by the dot the trucking regulations cover among other things i driver operations ii log book maintenance iii truck manifest preparations iv safety placard placement on the trucks and trailer vehicles v drug and alcohol testing and vi operation and equipment safety we are also subject to osha with respect to our trucking operations canada our trucking assets in canada are subject to regulation by both federal and provincial transportation agencies in the provinces in which they are operated these regulatory agencies do not set freight rates but do establish and administer rules and regulations relating to other matters including equipment facility inspection reporting and safety we are licensed to operate both intra and interprovincially under the direction of the national safety code “nsc” that is administered by transport canada  our forhire service is primarily the transportation of crude oil condensates and ngl  we are required under the nsc to among other things monitor i driver operations ii log book maintenance iii truck manifest preparations iv safety placard placement on the trucks and trailers v operation and equipment safety and vi many other aspects of trucking operations  we are also subject to occupational health and safety regulations with respect to our trucking operations on june   the transportation of dangerous goods “tdg” regulations were amended the amendments to the tdg regulations concern volume thresholds for reporting flammable product releases for many products transported by pmc the volume threshold for reporting changed from  litres  gallons to ‘any volume’ that could endanger public safety while this change in legislation may result in an increase in the number of reportable releases it is not expected to have a financial impact penalties or remediation railcar regulation we own and operate a number of railcar loading and unloading facilities in the united states and canada in connection with these rail terminals we own and lease a significant number of railcars our railcar operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the federal railroad administration of the dot the occupational safety and health administration as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and canadian regulatory agencies for operations in canada  table of contents railcar accidents involving trains carrying crude oil from north dakota’s bakken shale formation have led to increased regulatory scrutiny phmsa issued a safety advisory warning that bakken crude may be more flammable than other grades of crude oil and reinforcing the requirement to properly test characterize classify and where appropriate sufficiently degasify hazardous materials prior to and during transportation phmsa also initiated “operation classification” a compliance initiative involving unannounced inspections and testing of crude oil samples to verify that offerors of the materials have properly classified described and labeled the hazardous materials before transportation in may  phmsa adopted a final rule that among other things imposes a new tank car design standard a phase out by as early as january  for older dot tank cars that are not retrofitted and a classification and testing program for unrefined petroleum based products including crude oil we expect our railcar fleet to be in compliance with such requirements the rule also includes new operational requirements such as speed restrictions in december  congress passed the fixing america’s transportation “fast” act which was subsequently signed by the president this legislation clarified the parameters around the timeline and requirements for railcars hauling crude oil in the united states in december  the north dakota industrial commission adopted new standards to improve the safety of bakken crude oil for transport the new standard commission order  was effective april   and requires operatorsproducers to condition bakken crude oil to certain vapor pressure limits under the order all bakken crude oil produced in north dakota will be conditioned with no exceptions the order requires operatorsproducers to separate light hydrocarbons from all bakken crude oil to be transported and prohibits the blending of light hydrocarbons back into oil supplies prior to shipment we are not directly responsible for the conditioning or stabilization of bakken crude oil however under the order it is our responsibility to notify the state of north dakota upon discovering that bakken crude oil received at our rail facility exceeds the permitted vapor pressure limits cross border regulation as a result of our cross border activities including importation of crude oil ngl and natural gas between the united states and canada we are subject to a variety of legal requirements pertaining to such activities including exportimport license requirements tariffs canadian and us customs and taxes and requirements relating to toxic substances us legal requirements relating to these activities include regulations adopted pursuant to the short supply controls of the export administration act the north american free trade agreement and the toxic substances control act in addition the importation and exportation of natural gas from and to the united states and canada is subject to regulation by us customs and border protection us department of energy and the neb  violations of these licensing tariff and tax reporting requirements or failure to provide certifications relating to toxic substances could result in the imposition of significant administrative civil and criminal penalties furthermore the failure to comply with us federal state and local tax requirements as well as canadian federal and provincial tax requirements could lead to the imposition of additional taxes interest and penalties market antimanipulation regulation in november  the federal trade commission “ftc” issued regulations pursuant to the energy independence and security act of  intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry  violators of the regulations face civil penalties of up to  million per violation per day  in july  congress passed the doddfrank act which incorporated an expansion of the authority of the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” to prohibit market manipulation in the markets regulated by the cftc  this authority with respect to crude oil swaps and futures contracts is similar to the antimanipulation authority granted to the ftc with respect to crude oil purchases and sales  in july  the cftc issued final rules to implement their new antimanipulation authority  the rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of  million or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation natural gas storage regulation our natural gas storage operations are subject to regulatory oversight by numerous federal state and local regulatory agencies many of which are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations binding on the natural gas storage and pipeline industry related businesses and market participants  the failure to comply with such laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and fines the following is a summary of the kinds of regulation that may impact our natural gas storage operations  however our unitholders should not rely on such discussion as an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting our natural gas storage operations  table of contents our natural gas storage facilities provide natural gas storage services in interstate commerce and are subject to comprehensive regulation by the ferc under the natural gas act of  “nga” pursuant to the nga and ferc regulations storage providers are prohibited from making or granting any undue preference or advantage to any person or subjecting any person to any undue prejudice or disadvantage or from maintaining any unreasonable difference in rates charges service facilities or in any other respect the terms and conditions for services provided by our facilities are set forth in natural gas tariffs on file with the ferc we have been granted marketbased rate authorization for the services that our facilities provide marketbased rate authority allows us to negotiate rates with individual customers based on market demand the ferc also has authority over the siting construction and operation of united states pipeline transportation and storage facilities and related facilities used in the transportation storage and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce including the extension enlargement or abandonment of such facilities the ferc’s authority extends to maintenance of accounts and records terms and conditions of service acquisition and disposition of facilities initiation and discontinuation of services imposition of creditworthiness and credit support requirements applicable to customers and relationships among pipelines and storage companies and certain affiliates  our natural gas storage entities are required by the ferc to post certain information daily regarding customer activity capacity and volumes on their respective websites additionally the ferc has jurisdiction to impose rules and regulations applicable to all natural gas market participants to ensure market transparency ferc regulations require that buyers and sellers of more than a de minimis volume of natural gas report annual numbers and volumes of relevant transactions to the ferc our natural gas storage facilities and related marketing entities are subject to these annual reporting requirements under the energy policy act of  “epact ” and related regulations it is unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or transportation services subject to ferc jurisdiction to use or employ any device scheme or artifice to defraud to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person epact  gives the ferc civil penalty authority to impose penalties for certain violations of up to  per day for each violation ferc also has the authority to order disgorgement of profits from transactions deemed to violate the nga and the epact  in december  phmsa issued an interim final rule “ifr” that establishes minimum federal standards for underground natural gas storage facilities the ifr imposes new requirements on “downhole facilities” including wells wellbore tubing and casings at underground natural gas storage facilities the ifr addresses construction maintenance risk management and integrity management procedures for these facilities and includes registration and reporting obligations the ifr adopts and incorporates by reference the requirements and recommendations contained in american petroleum institute “api” recommended practice “rp”  and  existing underground natural gas storage facilities must meet the appropriate requirements and recommendations of api  and  by january   while we believe that our facilities are currently in substantial conformance with api  and  a review is underway to ensure consistency the natural gas industry historically has been heavily regulated new rules orders regulations or laws may be passed or implemented that impose additional costs burdens or restrictions on us we cannot give any assurance regarding the likelihood of such future rules orders regulations or laws or the effect they could have on our business financial condition and results of operations or ability to make distributions to our unitholders operational hazards and insurance pipelines terminals trucks or other facilities or equipment may experience damage as a result of an accident natural

damage and suspension of operations we maintain various types and varying levels of insurance coverage that we consider adequate under the circumstances to cover our operations and properties and we selfinsure certain risks including gradual pollution and named windstorm with respect to our insurance our policies are subject to deductibles and retention levels that we consider reasonable and not excessive however such insurance does not cover every potential risk that might occur associated with operating pipelines terminals and other facilities and equipment including the potential loss of significant revenues and cash flows since the terrorist attacks of september   the united states government has issued numerous warnings that energy assets including our nation’s pipeline infrastructure may be future targets of terrorist organizations these developments expose our operations and assets to increased risks we have instituted security measures and procedures in conformity with dot guidance we will institute as appropriate additional security measures or procedures indicated by the dot or the transportation safety administration however there can be no assurance that these or any other security measures  table of contents would protect our facilities from an attack any future terrorist attacks on our facilities those of our customers and in some cases those of our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business whether insured or not the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured indemnified or reserved against or the failure of a party to meet its indemnification obligations could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition we believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage although insurance will not cover many types of interruptions that might occur will not cover amounts up to applicable deductibles and will not cover all risks associated with certain of our assets and operations additionally we selfinsure certain risks including gradual pollution and named windstorm with respect to our insurance coverage no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable as a result we may elect to selfinsure or utilize higher deductibles in certain other insurance programs in addition although we believe that we have established adequate reserves and liquidity to the extent such risks are not insured costs incurred in excess of these reserves may be higher or we may not receive insurance proceeds in a timely manner and may potentially have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions results of operations or cash flows      title to properties and rightsofway our real property holdings generally consist of i parcels of land that we own in fee ii surface leases and underground storage leases and iii easements rightsofway permits crossing agreements or licenses from landowners or governmental

 employees covered by a separate agreement scheduled for renegotiation in january  also a first collective agreement is being negotiated for  employees who recently unionized in canada our general partner and its affiliates consider employee relations to be good summary of tax considerations the following is a brief summary of material tax considerations of owning and disposing of common units however the tax consequences of ownership of common units depends in part on the owner’s individual tax circumstances it is the responsibility of each unitholder either individually or through a tax advisor to investigate the legal and tax consequences under the laws of pertinent us federal states and localities of the unitholder’s investment in us further it is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all us federal state and local tax returns that may be required of the unitholder  also see item a “ risk factors — tax risks to common unitholders ” partnership status cash distributions we are treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership based upon our meeting the “qualifying income exception” imposed by section  of the internal revenue code the “code” which we must meet each year the owners of our common units are considered partners in the partnership so long as they do not loan their common units to others to cover short sales or otherwise dispose of those units accordingly we are not liable for us federal income taxes and a common unitholder is required to report on the unitholder’s federal income tax return the unitholder’s share of our income gains losses and deductions in general cash distributions to a common unitholder are taxable only if and to the extent that they exceed the tax basis in the common units held in certain cases we are subject to or have paid canadian income and withholding taxes canadian withholding taxes are due on intercompany interest payments and dividend payments and are treated as income tax expenses as a result of our restructuring of how we hold our canadian investment on january    unitholders may be eligible for foreign tax credits with respect to allocable canadian withholding and income taxes paid  table of contents partnership allocations in general our income and loss is allocated to the general partner and the unitholders for each taxable year in accordance with their respective percentage interests in the partnership as determined annually and prorated on a monthly basis and subsequently apportioned among the general partner and the unitholders of record as of the opening of the first business day of the month to which they relate even though unitholders may dispose of their units during the month in question in determining a unitholder’s us federal income tax liability the unitholder is required to take into account the unitholder’s share of income generated by us for each taxable year of the partnership ending with or within the unitholder’s taxable year even if cash distributions are not made to the unitholder as a consequence a unitholder’s share of our taxable income and possibly the income tax payable by the unitholder with respect to such income may exceed the cash actually distributed to the unitholder by us basis of common units a unitholder’s initial tax basis for a common unit is generally the amount paid for the common unit and the unitholder’s share of our nonrecourse liabilities or liabilities for which no partner bears the economic risk of loss a unitholder’s basis is generally increased by the unitholder’s share of our income and by any increases in the unitholder’s share of our nonrecourse liabilities that basis will be decreased but not below zero by the unitholder’s share of our losses and distributions including deemed distributions due to a decrease in the unitholder’s share of our nonrecourse liabilities limitations on deductibility of partnership losses the deduction by a unitholder of that unitholder’s allocable share of our losses will be limited to the amount of that unitholder’s tax basis in his or her common units and in the case of an individual unitholder or a corporate unitholder who is subject to the “at risk” rules generally certain closelyheld corporations to the amount for which the unitholder is considered to be “at risk” with respect to our activities if that is less than the unitholder’s tax basis a unitholder must recapture losses deducted in previous years to the extent that distributions cause the unitholder’s at risk amount to be less than zero at the end of any taxable year  losses disallowed to a unitholder or recaptured as a result of these limitations will carry forward and will be allowable as a deduction to the extent that his atrisk amount is subsequently increased provided such losses do not exceed such unitholder’s tax basis in his common units  upon the taxable disposition of a common unit any gain recognized by a unitholder can be offset by losses that were previously suspended by the at risk limitation but may not be offset by losses suspended by the basis limitation any loss previously suspended by the at risk limitation in excess of that gain could no longer be used in addition to the basis and atrisk limitations described above a passive activity loss limitation generally limits the deductibility of losses incurred by individuals estates trusts some closelyheld corporations and personal service corporations from “passive activities” generally trade or business activities in which the taxpayer does not materially participate the passive loss limitations are applied separately with respect to each publiclytraded partnership consequently any passive losses we generate will be available to offset only passive income generated by us and will not be available to offset income from other passive activities or investments including investments in other publicly traded partnerships or salary active business or other income passive losses that exceed a unitholder’s share of passive income we generate may be deducted in full when the unitholder disposes of all of its units in a fully taxable transaction with an unrelated party the passive activity loss rules are generally applied after other applicable limitations on deductions including the at risk and basis limitations section  election we have made the election provided for by section  of the code which will generally result in a unitholder being allocated income and deductions calculated by reference to the portion of the unitholder’s purchase price attributable to each asset of the partnership  table of contents disposition of common units a unitholder who sells common units will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the adjusted tax basis of those common units a unitholder may not be able to trace basis to particular common units for this purpose thus distributions of cash from us to a unitholder in excess of the income allocated to the unitholder will in effect become taxable income if the unitholder sells the common units at a price greater than the unitholder’s adjusted tax basis even if the price is less than the unitholder’s original cost moreover a portion of the amount realized whether or not representing gain will be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items including depreciation recapture in addition because the amount realized includes a unitholder’s share of our nonrecourse liabilities a unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash the unitholder receives from the sale state local and other tax considerations in addition to federal income taxes unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes including state and local income taxes unincorporated business taxes and estate inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which a unitholder resides or in which we conduct business or own property we own property and conduct business in most states in the united states as well as several provinces in canada a unitholder may also be required to file state income tax returns and to pay taxes in various states even if they do not live in those jurisdictions as our entire canadian source income passes through canadian taxable entities our unitholders do not have a separate canadian tax filing obligation as it relates to this income unitholders who are not resident in the united states may have additional tax reporting and payment requirements a unitholder may be subject to interest and penalties for failure to comply with such requirements in certain states tax losses may not produce a tax benefit in the year incurred if for example we have no income from sources within that state and also may not be available to offset income in subsequent taxable years some states may require us or we may elect to withhold a percentage of income from amounts to be distributed to a unitholder who is not a resident of the state withholding the amount of which may be more or less than a particular unitholder’s income tax liability owed to a particular state may not relieve the unitholder from the obligation to file an income tax return in that state amounts withheld may be treated as if distributed to unitholders for purposes of determining the amounts distributed by us ownership of common units by taxexempt organizations and certain other investors an investment in common units by taxexempt organizations including individual retirement accounts “iras” and other retirement plans and nonus persons raises issues unique to such persons virtually all of our income allocated to a unitholder that is a taxexempt organization is unrelated business taxable income and thus is taxable to such a unitholder a unitholder who is a nonresident alien nonus corporation or other nonus person is regarded as being engaged in a trade or business in the united states as a result of ownership of a common unit and thus is required to file federal income tax returns and to pay tax on the unitholder’s share of our taxable income finally distributions to nonus unitholders are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest applicable rate available information we make available free of charge on our internet website at

contents item  a   risk factors risks related to our business our profitability depends on the volume of crude oil natural gas and ngl shipped processed purchased stored fractionated andor gathered at or through the use of our facilities which can be negatively impacted by a variety of factors outside of our control our profitability could be materially impacted by a decline in the volume of crude oil natural gas and ngl transported gathered stored or processed at our facilities a material decrease in crude oil or natural gas production or crude oil refining as a result of depressed commodity prices natural decline rates attributable to crude oil and natural gas reservoirs a decrease in exploration and development activities supply disruptions economic conditions or otherwise could result in a decline in the volume of crude oil natural gas or ngl handled by our facilities during the latter half of  and continuing into  benchmark crude oil prices declined significantly as a result many of the companies that produce oil and gas significantly reduced capital expenditures such reduced expenditure levels coupled with high decline rates for many horizontal wells in the shale resource plays led to production declines in many areas in the lower  united states excluding gulf of mexico production other factors that could adversely impact production include reduced capital market access increased capital raising costs for producers or adverse governmental or regulatory action in turn such developments could lead to reduced throughput on our pipelines and at our other facilities which depending on the level of production declines could have a material adverse effect on our business also except with respect to some of our recently constructed pipeline assets thirdparty shippers generally do not have longterm contractual commitments to ship crude oil on our pipelines a decision by a shipper to substantially reduce or cease to ship volumes of crude oil on our pipelines could cause a significant decline in our revenues to maintain the volumes of crude oil we purchase in connection with our operations we must continue to contract for new supplies of crude oil to offset volumes lost because of reduced drilling activity by producers natural declines in crude oil production from depleting wells or volumes lost to competitors if production declines competitors with underutilized assets could impair our ability to secure additional supplies of crude oil we may not be able to compete effectively in our transportation facilities and supply and logistics activities and our business is subject to various risks associated with the general capacity overbuild of midstream energy infrastructure in some of the areas where we operate we face competition in all aspects of our business and can give no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors  in general competition comes from a wide variety of participants in a wide variety of contexts including new entrants and existing participants and in connection with daytoday business expansion capital projects acquisitions and joint venture activities  some of our competitors have capital resources many times greater than ours and control greater supplies of crude oil natural gas or ngl a significant driver of competition in some of the markets where we operate including for example the eagle ford permian basin and rockiesbakken areas stems from the rapid development of new midstream energy infrastructure capacity that was driven by the combination of i significant increases in oil and gas production and development in the applicable production areas both actual and anticipated ii relatively low barriers to entry and iii generally widespread access to relatively low cost capital while this environment presented opportunities for us many of these areas have become overbuilt resulting in an excess of midstream energy infrastructure capacity  in addition as an established participant in some markets we also face competition from aggressive new entrants to the market that are willing to provide services at a discount in order to establish relationships and gain a foothold in the market  current expectations for oil and gas development in many of the areas where we operate are not as robust as they were during the last few years this adversely impacts both our existing assets and growth projects in such areas we also face competition for incremental volumes from shippers on third party pipelines who overcommitted relative to their actual production or committed supplies and are now purchasing barrels on the open market and shipping them on such third party pipelines in order to satisfy their minimum commitment levels this puts downward pressure on our throughput and margins and together with other adverse competitive effects could have a significant adverse impact on our financial position cash flows and ability to pay or increase distributions to our unitholders  table of contents with respect to our crude oil activities our competitors include other crude oil pipelines the major integrated oil companies their marketing affiliates refiners private equity backed entities independent gatherers brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes financial resources and experience we compete against these companies on the basis of many factors including geographic proximity to production areas market access rates terms of service connection costs and other factors with respect to our natural gas storage operations the principal elements of competition are rates terms of service supply and market access and flexibility of service our natural gas storage facilities compete with several other storage providers including regional storage facilities and utilities certain pipeline companies have existing storage facilities connected to their systems that compete with some of our facilities with regard to our ngl operations we compete with large oil natural gas and natural gas liquids companies that may relative to us have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas and ngl the principal elements of competition are rates processing fees geographic proximity to the natural gas or ngl mix available processing and fractionation capacity transportation alternatives and their associated costs and access to end user markets fluctuations in supply and demand which can be caused by a variety of factors outside of our control can negatively affect our operating results supply and demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbon products we handle is dependent upon a variety of factors including price the impact of future economic conditions fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements governmental regulation including climate change regulations and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices for example the adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could increase the cost of consuming crude oil and other hydrocarbon products thereby causing a reduction in the demand for such products demand also depends on the ability and willingness of shippers having access to our transportation assets to satisfy their demand by deliveries through those assets the supply of crude oil depends on a variety of global political and economic factors including the reliance of foreign governments on petroleum revenues excess global supply of crude oil may negatively impact our operating results by decreasing the price of crude oil and making production and transportation less profitable in areas we service fluctuations in demand for crude oil such as those caused by refinery downtime or shutdowns can have a negative effect on our operating results specifically reduced demand in an area serviced by our transportation systems will negatively affect the throughput on such systems although the negative impact may be mitigated or overcome by our ability to capture differentials created by demand fluctuations this ability is dependent on location and grade of crude oil and thus is unpredictable fluctuations in demand for ngl products whether because of general or industry specific economic conditions new government regulations global competition reduced demand by consumers for products made with ngl products increased competition from petroleumbased feedstocks due to pricing differences mild winter weather for some ngl products particularly propane or other reasons could result in a decline in the volume of ngl products we handle or a reduction of the fees we charge for our services also increased supply of ngl products could reduce the value of ngl we handle and reduce the margins realized by us ngl and products produced from ngl also compete with products from global markets any reduced demand or increased supply for ethane propane normal butane isobutane or natural gasoline in the markets we access for any of the reasons stated above could adversely affect demand for the services we provide as well as ngl prices which could negatively impact our operating results our results of operations are influenced by the overall forward market for crude oil and certain market structures or the absence of pricing volatility may adversely impact our results results from our supply and logistics segment are influenced by the overall forward market for crude oil a contango market is favorable to commercial strategies that are associated with storage capacity as it allows a party to simultaneously purchase crude oil at current prices for storage and sell at higher prices for future delivery wide contango spreads combined with price structure volatility generally have a favorable impact on our results a backwardated market meaning that the price of crude oil for future deliveries is lower than current prices can have a positive impact on lease gathering margins because in certain circumstances crude oil gatherers can capture a premium for prompt deliveries however in this environment there is little incentive to store crude oil as current prices are above future delivery prices in either case margins can be improved when prices are volatile the periods between these two market structures are referred to as transition periods if the market is in a backwardated to transitional structure our results from our supply and logistics segment may be less than those generated  table of contents during the more favorable contango market conditions additionally a prolonged transition period or a lack of volatility in the pricing structure may further negatively impact our results depending on the overall duration of these transition periods how we have allocated our assets to particular strategies and the time length of our crude oil purchase and sale contracts and storage agreements these transition periods may have either an adverse or beneficial effect on our aggregate segment results a prolonged transition from a backwardated market to a contango market or vice versa essentially a market that is neither in pronounced backwardation nor contango represents the least beneficial environment for our supply and logistics segment a natural disaster catastrophe terrorist attack including ecoterrorist attacks process safety failure or other event including pipeline or facility accidents and attacks on our electronic and computer systems could interrupt our operations andor result in severe personal injury property damage and environmental damage which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows some of our operations involve risks of personal injury property damage and environmental damage which could curtail our operations and otherwise materially adversely affect our cash flow virtually all of our operations are exposed to potential natural disasters or other natural events including hurricanes tornadoes storms floods earthquakes shifting soil andor landslides the location of some of our assets and our customers’ assets in the us gulf coast region makes them particularly vulnerable to hurricane or tropical storm risk our facilities and operations are also vulnerable to accidents caused by process safety failures equipment failures or human error in addition since the september   terrorist attacks the us government has issued warnings that energy assets specifically the nation’s pipeline infrastructure may be future targets of terrorist organizations terrorists may target our physical facilities and hackers may attack our electronic and computer systems if one or more of our pipelines or facilities including electronic and computer systems or any facilities or businesses that deliver products supplies or services to us or that we rely on in order to operate our business are damaged by severe weather or any other disaster accident catastrophe terrorist attack or event our operations could be significantly interrupted these interruptions could involve significant damage or injury to people property or the environment and repairs could take from a week or less for minor incidents to six months or more for major interruptions any such event that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance could reduce our cash available for paying distributions to our partners and accordingly adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our securities we may also suffer damage including reputational damage as a result of a disaster accident catastrophe terrorist attack or other such event the occurrence of such an event or a series of such events especially if one or more of them occurs in a highly populated or sensitive area could negatively impact public perception of our operations andor make it more difficult for us to obtain the approvals permits licenses or real property interests we need in order to operate our assets or complete planned growth projects we may face opposition to the operation of our pipelines and facilities from various groups we may face opposition to the operation of our pipelines and facilities from environmental groups landowners tribal groups local groups and other advocates such opposition could take many forms including organized protests attempts to block or sabotage our operations intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent disrupt or delay the operation of our assets and business for example repairing our pipelines often involves securing consent from individual landowners to access their property one or more landowners may resist our efforts to make needed repairs which could lead to an interruption in the operation of the affected pipeline or facility for a period of time that is significantly longer than would have otherwise been the case in addition acts of sabotage or ecoterrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations any such event that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance could reduce our cash available for paying distributions to our partners and accordingly adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our securities cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and operations and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and information regarding our customers suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error  table of contents malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information regulatory penalties for divulging shipper information disruption of our operations damage to our reputation and loss of confidence in our services which could adversely affect our business our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities or other disruptions could result in damage to our assets safety incidents damage to the environment potential liability or the loss of contracts and have a material adverse effect on our operations financial position and results of operations our growth strategy requires access to new capital tightened capital markets or other factors that increase our cost of capital could impair our ability to grow we continuously consider potential acquisitions and opportunities for expansion capital projects acquisition transactions can be effected quickly may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets and operations our ability to fund our capital projects and make acquisitions depends on whether we can access the necessary financing to fund these activities  any limitations on our access to capital or increase in the cost of that capital could significantly impair our growth strategy our ability to maintain our targeted credit profile including maintaining our credit ratings could affect our cost of capital as well as our ability to execute our growth strategy in addition a variety of factors beyond our control could impact the availability or cost of capital including domestic or international economic conditions increases in key benchmark interest rates andor credit spreads the adoption of new or amended banking or capital market laws or regulations the repricing of market risks and volatility in capital and financial markets in addition our ability to achieve and maintain our target credit profile is in part dependent on our ability to consummate previously announced divestiture transactions the closing of such transactions is not entirely within our control and depends in part on the satisfaction of closing conditions that require action by governmental authorities or others to the extent we are unable to consummate such transactions we may be forced to incur additional indebtedness or issue more equity than we would have otherwise preferred which could make it harder for us to achieve our target credit profile due to these factors we cannot be certain that funding for our capital needs will be available from bank credit arrangements capital markets or other sources on acceptable terms if funding is not available when needed or is available only on unfavorable terms we may be unable to implement our development plans enhance our existing business complete acquisitions and construction projects take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations loss of our investment grade credit rating or the ability to receive open credit could negatively affect our borrowing costs ability to purchase crude oil ngl and natural gas supplies or to capitalize on market opportunities we believe that because of our strategic asset base and complementary business model we will continue to benefit from swings in market prices and shifts in market structure during periods of volatility in the crude oil ngl and natural gas markets the extent to which we are able to capture that benefit however is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including whether we will be able to maintain an attractive credit rating and continue to receive open credit from our suppliers and trade counterparties our senior unsecured debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s moody’s investors service and fitch ratings inc however in late january  moody’s investors service placed such rating under review for downgrade a downgrade below our current ratings levels by any of such rating agencies could increase our borrowing costs reduce our borrowing capacity and cause our counterparties to reduce the amount of open credit we receive from them  this could negatively impact our ability to capitalize on market opportunities for example our ability to utilize our crude oil storage capacity for merchant activities to capture contango market opportunities is dependent upon having adequate credit facilities both in terms of the total amount of credit facilities and the cost of such credit facilities which enables us to finance the storage of the crude oil from the time we complete the purchase of the crude oil until the time we complete the sale of the crude oil loss of our investment grade credit rating could also adversely impact our cash flows our ability to make distributions at our current levels and the value of our outstanding equity and debt securities  table of contents we may not be able to fully implement or capitalize upon planned growth projects we have a number of organic growth projects that involve the construction of new midstream energy infrastructure assets or the expansion or modification of existing assets many of these projects involve numerous regulatory environmental commercial economic weatherrelated political and legal uncertainties that are beyond our control including the following • as these projects are undertaken required approvals permits and licenses may not be obtained may be delayed may be obtained with conditions that materially alter the expected return associated with the underlying projects or may be granted and then subsequently withdrawn • we may face opposition to our planned growth projects from environmental groups landowners local groups and other advocates including lawsuits or other actions designed to disrupt or delay our planned projects • we may not be able to obtain or we may be significantly delayed in obtaining all of the rights of way or other real property interests we need to complete such projects or the costs we incur in order to obtain such rights of way or other interests may be greater than we anticipated • despite the fact that we will expend significant amounts of capital during the construction phase of these projects revenues associated with these organic growth projects will not materialize until the projects have been completed and placed into commercial service and the amount of revenue generated from these projects could be significantly lower than anticipated for a variety of reasons • we may construct pipelines facilities or other assets in anticipation of market demand that dissipates or market growth that never materializes • due to unavailability or costs of materials supplies power labor or equipment including increased costs associated with any requirements to source certain supplies or materials from us suppliers or manufacturers the cost of completing these projects could turn out to be significantly higher than we budgeted and the time it takes to complete construction of these projects and place them into commercial service could be significantly longer than planned and • the completion or success of our projects may depend on the completion or success of thirdparty facilities over which we have no control as a result of these uncertainties the anticipated benefits associated with our capital projects may not be achieved or could be delayed  in turn this could negatively impact our cash flow and our ability to make or increase cash distributions to our partners if we do not make acquisitions or if we make acquisitions that fail to perform as anticipated our future growth may be limited  our ability to grow our distributions depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in operating surplus per unit if we are unable to make such accretive acquisitions either because we are i unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with the sellers ii unable to raise financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or iii outbid by competitors our future growth will be limited as a result we may not be able to grow as quickly as we have historically in evaluating acquisitions we generally prepare one or more financial cases based on a number of business industry economic legal regulatory and other assumptions applicable to the proposed transaction although we expect a reasonable basis will exist for those assumptions the assumptions will generally involve current estimates of future conditions realization of many of the assumptions will be beyond our control moreover the uncertainty and risk of inaccuracy associated with any financial projection will increase with the length of the forecasted period some acquisitions may not be accretive in the near term and will be accretive in the long term only if we are able to timely and effectively integrate the underlying assets and such assets perform at or near the levels anticipated in our acquisition projections  table of contents acquisitions involve risks that may adversely affect our business  any acquisition involves potential risks including • performance from the acquired businesses or assets that is below the forecasts we used in evaluating the acquisition • a significant increase in our indebtedness and working capital requirements • the inability to timely and effectively integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets • the incurrence of substantial unforeseen environmental and other liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses or assets for which we are either not indemnified or the indemnity is not from a creditworthy party including liabilities arising from the operation of the acquired businesses or assets prior to our acquisition • risks associated with operating in lines of business that are distinct and separate from our historical operations • customer or key employee loss from the acquired businesses and • the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows from our acquisitions realize other anticipated benefits and our ability to pay distributions to our partners or meet our debt service requirements we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and other counterparties we transact within the ordinary course of our business activities risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a significant consideration in our business and are of increased concern in the current low commodity price environment although we have credit risk management policies and procedures that are designed to mitigate and limit our exposure in this area there can be no assurance that we have adequately assessed and managed the creditworthiness of our existing or future counterparties or that there will not be an unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness or unexpected instances of nonpayment or nonperformance all of which could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and our ability to pay or increase our cash distributions to our partners we have a number of minimum volume commitment contracts that support pipelines in our transportation segment in addition certain of the pipelines in which we own a joint venture interest have minimum volume commitment contracts pursuant to such contracts shippers are obligated to pay for a minimum volume of transportation service regardless of whether such volume is actually shipped typically referred to as a deficiency payment subject to the receipt of credits that typically expire if not used by a certain date while such contracts provide greater revenue certainty if the applicable shipper fails to transport the minimum required volume and is required to make a deficiency payment under applicable accounting rules the revenue associated with such deficiency payment may not be recognized until the applicable transportation credit has expired or has been used deferred revenue associated with nonperformance by shippers under minimum volume contracts could be significant and could adversely affect our profitability and earnings in addition in those cases in which we provide division order services for crude oil purchased at the wellhead we may be responsible for distribution of proceeds to all parties in other cases we pay all of or a portion of the production proceeds to an operator who distributes these proceeds to the various interest owners these arrangements expose us to operator credit risk and there can be no assurance that we will not experience losses in dealings with such operators and other parties further to the extent one or more of our major customers experiences financial distress or commences bankruptcy proceedings contracts with such customers including contracts that are supported by acreage dedications may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the united states bankruptcy code any such renegotiation or rejection could have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders we have also undertaken numerous projects that require cooperation with and performance by joint venture coowners nonperformance by these parties could result in increased costs or delays that could decrease our returns on these joint venture projects we also rely to a significant degree on the banks that lend to us under our revolving credit facility for financial liquidity and any failure of those banks to perform on their obligations to us could significantly impair our liquidity  table of contents furthermore nonpayment by the counterparties to our interest rate commodity andor foreign currency derivatives could expose us to additional interest rate commodity price andor foreign currency risk our risk policies cannot eliminate all risks in addition any noncompliance with our risk policies could result in significant financial losses generally it is our policy to establish a margin for crude oil or other products we purchase by selling such products for physical delivery to thirdparty users or by entering into a future delivery obligation under derivative contracts through these transactions we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases on the one hand and sales or future delivery obligations on the other hand our policy is not to acquire and hold physical inventory or derivative products for the purpose of speculating on commodity price changes these policies and practices cannot however eliminate all risks for example any event that disrupts our anticipated physical supply of crude oil or other products could expose us to risk of loss resulting from price changes we are also exposed to basis risk when crude oil or other products are purchased against one pricing index and sold against a different index moreover we are exposed to some risks that are not hedged including risks on certain of our inventory such as linefill which must be maintained in order to transport crude oil on our pipelines in an effort to maintain a balanced position specifically authorized personnel can purchase or sell crude oil refined products and ngl up to predefined limits and authorizations although this activity is monitored independently by our risk management function it exposes us to commodity price risks within these limits in addition our operations involve the risk of noncompliance with our risk policies we have taken steps within our organization to implement processes and procedures designed to detect unauthorized trading however we can provide no assurance that these steps will detect and prevent all violations of our risk policies and procedures particularly if deception collusion or other intentional misconduct is involved our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and wildlife operational safety climate change and related matters that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities  our operations involving the storage treatment processing and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons including crude oil ngl and refined products as well as our operations involving the storage of natural gas are subject to stringent federal state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and wildlife operational safety climate change and related matters compliance with all of these laws and regulations increases our overall cost of doing business including our capital costs to construct maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities for example the adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases including cap and trade programs could require us to incur increased operating costs such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements in addition with respect to our railcar operations the adoption of new regulations designed to enhance the overall safety of crude oil and natural gas liquids transportation by rail could result in increased operating costs and potentially involve substantial capital expenditures also the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities the issuance of injunctions that may subject us to additional operational requirements and constraints or claims of damages to property or persons resulting from our operations the laws and regulations applicable to our operations are subject to change and interpretation by the relevant governmental agency including the possibility that exemptions we currently qualify for may be modified or changed in ways that require us to incur significant additional compliance costs any such change or interpretation adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our operations revenues expenses and profitability we have a history of incremental additions to the miles of pipelines we own both through acquisitions and expansion capital projects we have also increased our terminal and storage capacity and operate several facilities on or near navigable waters and domestic water supplies although we have implemented programs intended to maintain the integrity of our assets discussed below as we acquire additional assets we historically have observed an increase in the number of releases of liquid hydrocarbons into the environment these releases expose us to potentially substantial expense including cleanup and remediation costs fines and penalties and third party claims for personal injury or property damage related to past or future releases some of these expenses could increase by amounts disproportionately higher than the relative increase in pipeline mileage and the increase in revenues associated therewith our refined products terminal assets are also subject to significant compliance costs and liabilities in addition because of their increased volatility and tendency to migrate farther and faster than crude oil releases of refined products into the environment can have a more significant impact than crude oil and require significantly higher expenditures to respond and remediate the incurrence of such expenses not covered by insurance indemnity or reserves could materially adversely affect our results of operations  table of contents we currently devote substantial resources to comply with dotmandated pipeline integrity rules the  pipeline safety act requires the dot to issue regulations for certain pipelines that were not previously subject to regulation the dot regulations include requirements for the establishment of pipeline integrity management programs and for protection of “high consequence areas” where a pipeline leak or rupture could produce significant adverse consequences we have also developed and implemented certain pipeline integrity measures that we believe go beyond regulatory mandates see items  and  “business and properties—regulation” for  and beyond we will continue to focus on pipeline integrity management as a primary operational emphasis in that regard we have implemented programs intended to maintain the integrity of our assets with a continued focus on risk reduction through testing enhanced corrosion control leak detection and damage prevention we have an internal review process pursuant to which we examine various aspects of our pipeline and gathering systems that are not subject to the dot pipeline integrity management mandate the purpose of this process is to review the surrounding environment condition and operating history of these pipeline and gathering assets to determine if such assets warrant additional investment or replacement accordingly in addition to potential cost increases related to unanticipated regulatory changes or injunctive remedies resulting from regulatory agency enforcement actions we may elect as a result of our own internal initiatives to spend substantial sums to enhance the integrity of and upgrade our pipeline systems to maintain environmental compliance and in some cases we may take pipelines out of service if we believe the cost of upgrades will exceed the value of the pipelines we cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate amount or timing of future pipeline integrity expenditures but any such expenditures could be significant see “ environmental — general ” in note  to our consolidated financial statements in addition despite our pipeline and facility integrity management efforts we can provide no assurance that our pipelines and facilities will not experience leaks or releases or that we will be able to fully comply with all of the federal state and local laws and regulations applicable to the operation of our pipelines or facilities any such leaks or releases could be material and could have a significant adverse impact on our reputation financial position cash flows and ability to pay or increase distributions to our unitholders our assets are subject to federal state and provincial regulation rate regulation or a successful challenge to the rates we charge on our us and canadian pipeline systems may reduce the amount of cash we generate our us interstate common carrier liquids pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc under the ica the ica requires that tariff rates for liquids pipelines be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory we are also subject to the pipeline safety regulations of the dot our intrastate pipeline transportation activities are subject to various state laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies for our us interstate common carrier liquids pipelines subject to ferc regulation under the ica shippers may protest our pipeline tariff filings file complaints against our existing rates or the ferc can investigate on its own initiative under certain circumstances the ferc could limit our ability to set rates based on our costs or could order us to reduce our rates and could require the payment of reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the complaint natural gas storage facilities are subject to regulation by the ferc and certain state agencies our canadian pipelines are subject to regulation by the neb and by provincial authorities under the national energy board act the neb could investigate the tariff rates or the terms and conditions of service relating to a jurisdictional pipeline on its own initiative upon the filing of a toll or tariff application or upon the filing of a written complaint if the neb found the rates or terms of service relating to such pipeline to be unjust or unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory the neb could require us to change our rates provide access to other shippers or change our terms of service a provincial authority could on the application of a shipper or other interested party investigate the tariff rates or our terms and conditions of service relating to our provincially regulated proprietary pipelines if it found our rates or terms of service to be contrary to statutory requirements it could impose conditions it considers appropriate a provincial authority could declare a pipeline to be a common carrier pipeline and require us to change our rates provide access to other shippers or otherwise alter our terms of service any reduction in our tariff rates would result in lower revenue and cash flows some of our operations cross the uscanada border and are subject to crossborder regulation our cross border activities subject us to regulatory matters including import and export licenses tariffs canadian and us customs and tax issues and toxic substance certifications such regulations include the short supply controls of the export administration act the north american free trade agreement and the toxic substances control act violations of these licensing tariff and tax reporting requirements could result in the imposition of significant administrative civil and criminal penalties  table of contents our sales of crude oil natural gas and ngl and hedging activities expose us to potential regulatory risks the ftc the ferc and the cftc hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets these agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets with regard to our physical sales of oil natural gas or ngl and any related hedging activities that we undertake we are required to observe the marketrelated regulations enforced by these agencies which hold substantial enforcement authority  our sales may also be subject to certain reporting and other requirements additionally to the extent that we enter into transportation contracts with natural gas pipelines that are subject to ferc regulation we are subject to ferc requirements related to the use of such capacity any failure on our part to comply with the regulations and policies of the ferc the ftc or the cftc could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties failure to comply with such regulations as interpreted and enforced could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders the enactment and implementation of derivatives legislation could have an adverse impact on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirement to conduct these hedging activities the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “dodd frank act” enacted on july   established federal oversight and regulation of derivative markets and entities such as us that participate in those markets the dodd frank act requires the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the dodd frank act although the cftc has finalized certain regulations others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished in october  the cftc issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets the initial position limits rule was vacated by the united states district court for the district of columbia in september  however in november  the cftc proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions  as these new position limit rules are not yet final the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time the cftc has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules require us in connection with covered derivative activities to comply with clearing and tradeexecution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption from such requirements we do not utilize credit default swaps and we qualify for and expect to continue to qualify for the enduser exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our interest rate risks  should the cftc designate commodity derivatives for mandatory clearing we would expect to qualify for an enduser exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commodity price risk  however the majority of our financial derivative transactions used for hedging commodity price risks are currently executed and cleared over exchanges that require the posting of margin or letters of credit based on initial and variation margin requirements pursuant to the dodd frank act however the cftc or federal banking regulators may require the posting of collateral with respect to uncleared interest rate and commodity derivative transactions certain banking regulators and the cftc have adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps although we qualify for the enduser exception from margin requirements for swaps entered into to hedge commercial risks if any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial enduser exception a requirement to post additional cash margin or collateral could reduce our ability to execute hedges necessary to reduce commodity price exposures and protect cash flows posting of additional cash margin or collateral could affect our liquidity defined as unrestricted cash on hand plus available capacity under our credit facilities and reduce our ability to use cash for capital expenditures or other partnership purposes even if we ourselves are not required to post additional cash margin or collateral for our derivative contracts the banks and other derivatives dealers who are our contractual counterparties will be required to comply with other new requirements under the dodd frank act and related rules  the costs of such compliance may be passed on to customers such as ourselves thus decreasing the benefits to us of hedging transactions or reducing our profitability  in addition implementation of the dodd frank act and related rules and regulations could reduce the overall liquidity and depth of the markets for financial and other derivatives we utilize in connection with our business which could expose us to additional risks or limit the opportunities we are able to capture by limiting the extent to which we are able to execute our hedging strategies  table of contents finally the dodd frank act was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and gas our financial results could be adversely affected if a consequence of the dodd frank act and implementing regulations is lower commodity prices the full impact of the dodd frank act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted the dodd frank act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts materially alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the dodd frank act and regulations implementing the dodd frank act our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and our results of operations legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could reduce domestic production of crude oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from unconventional geological formations recent advances in hydraulic fracturing techniques have resulted in significant increases in crude oil and natural gas production in many basins in the united states and canada the process involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production and it is typically regulated by state and provincial oil and gas commissions  we do not perform hydraulic fracturing but many of the producers using our pipelines do hydraulic fracturing has been subject to increased scrutiny due to public concerns that it could result in contamination of drinking water supplies and there have been a variety of legislative and regulatory proposals to prohibit restrict or more closely regulate various forms of hydraulic fracturing  any legislation or regulatory initiatives that curtail hydraulic fracturing could reduce the production of crude oil and natural gas in the united states or canada and could thereby reduce demand for our transportation terminalling and storage services as well as our supply and logistics services we may in the future encounter increased costs related to and lack of availability of insurance over the last several years as the scale and scope of our business activities has expanded the breadth and depth of available insurance markets has contracted as a result of these factors and other market conditions as well as the fact that we have experienced several incidents over the last  to  years premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies have increased substantially accordingly we can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates or on other terms we consider commercially reasonable in addition although we believe that we currently maintain adequate insurance coverage insurance will not cover many types of interruptions or events that might occur and will not cover all risks associated with our operations in addition the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur the occurrence of a significant event the consequences of which are either not covered by insurance or not fully insured or a significant delay in the payment of a major insurance claim could materially and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows the terms of our indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds or capitalize on business opportunities in addition our future debt level may limit our future financial and operating flexibility as of december    the face value of our consolidated debt outstanding was approximately  billion  consisting of approximately  billion face value of longterm debt including senior notes and longterm commercial paper borrowings and approximately  billion of shortterm borrowings as of december    we had approximately  billion of liquidity available including cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility our senior secured hedged inventory facility and our senior unsecured day credit facility subject to continued covenant compliance lower adjusted ebitda could increase our leverage ratios and effectively reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness the amount of our current or future indebtedness could have significant effects on our operations including among other things • a significant portion of our cash flow will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and may not be available for other purposes including the payment of distributions on our units and capital expenditures • credit rating agencies may view our debt level negatively  table of contents • covenants contained in our existing debt arrangements will require us to continue to meet financial tests that may adversely affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business • our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general partnership purposes may be limited • we may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to similar companies that have less debt and • we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions as a result of our significant debt level our credit agreements prohibit distributions on or purchases or redemptions of units if any default or event of default is continuing in addition the agreements contain various covenants limiting our ability to among other things incur indebtedness if certain financial ratios are not maintained grant liens engage in transactions with affiliates enter into saleleaseback transactions and sell substantially all of our assets or enter into a merger or consolidation our credit facility treats a change of control as an event of default and also requires us to maintain a certain debt coverage ratio our senior notes do not restrict distributions to unitholders but a default under our credit agreements will be treated as a default under the senior notes please read item  “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — credit agreements commercial paper program and indentures ” our ability to access capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms will be affected by our debt level our operating and financial performance the amount of our current maturities and debt maturing in the next several years and by prevailing market conditions moreover if the rating agencies were to downgrade our credit ratings then we could experience an increase in our borrowing costs face difficulty accessing capital markets or incurring additional indebtedness be unable to receive open credit from our suppliers and trade counterparties be unable to benefit from swings in market prices and shifts in market structure during periods of volatility in the crude oil market or suffer a reduction in the market price of our common units if we are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms at the time a debt obligation becomes due in the future we might be forced to refinance some of our debt obligations through bank credit as opposed to longterm public debt securities or equity securities or sell assets the price and terms upon which we might receive such extensions or additional bank credit if at all could be more onerous than those contained in existing debt agreements any such arrangements could in turn increase the risk that our leverage may adversely affect our future financial and operating flexibility and thereby impact our ability to pay cash distributions at expected rates increases in interest rates could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our units as of december    the face value of our consolidated debt was approximately  billion  of which approximately  billion was at fixed interest rates and approximately  billion was at variable interest rates we are exposed to market risk due to the shortterm nature of our commercial paper borrowings and the floating interest rates on our credit facilities our results of operations cash flows and financial position could be adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates above current levels additionally increases in interest rates could adversely affect our supply and logistics segment results by increasing interest costs associated with the storage of hedged crude oil and ngl inventory further the trading price of our common units may be sensitive to changes in interest rates and any rise in interest rates could adversely impact such trading price changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results because we are a us dollar reporting company and also conduct operations in canada we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks that may adversely affect the us dollar value of our earnings cash flow and partners’ capital under applicable accounting rules for example as the us dollar appreciates against the canadian dollar the us dollar value of our canadian dollar denominated earnings is reduced for us reporting purposes an impairment of longterm assets could reduce our earnings at december    we had approximately  billion of net property and equipment  billion of goodwill  billion of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting and  million of net intangible assets capitalized on our balance sheet gaap requires an assessment for impairment on an annual basis or in certain circumstances including when there is an indication that the carrying value of property and equipment may not be recoverable or a determination that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s carrying value is in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value if we were to determine that any of our property and equipment goodwill intangibles or equity method investments was impaired we could be required to take an immediate charge to earnings which could adversely impact our operating results with a corresponding reduction of partners’ capital and increase in balance sheet leverage as measured by debttototal  table of contents capitalization during the year ended december   we recognized impairment losses of approximately  million see note  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impairments rail and marine transportation of crude oil have inherent operating risks our supply and logistics operations include purchasing crude oil that is carried on railcars tankers or barges such cargos are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as derailment marine disaster inclement weather mechanical failures grounding or collision fire explosion environmental accidents piracy terrorism and political instability such occurrences could result in death or injury to persons loss of property or environmental damage delays in the delivery of cargo loss of revenues termination of contracts governmental fines penalties or restrictions on conducting business higher insurance rates and damage to our reputation and customer relationships generally although certain of these risks may be covered under our insurance program any of these circumstances or events could increase our costs or lower our revenues we are dependent on use of thirdparty assets for certain of our operations certain of our business activities require the use of thirdparty assets over which we may have little or no control for example a portion of our storage and distribution business conducted in the los angeles basin receives waterborne crude oil through dock facilities operated by a third party in the port of long beach if at any time our access to this dock was denied and if access to an alternative dock could not be arranged the volume of crude oil that we presently receive from our customers in the los angeles basin may be reduced which could result in a reduction of facilities segment revenue and cash flow nonutilization of certain assets such as our leased railcars could significantly reduce our profitability due to fixed costs incurred to obtain the right to use such assets from time to time in connection with our business we may lease or otherwise secure the right to use certain third party assets such as railcars trucks barges ships pipeline capacity storage capacity and other similar assets with the expectation that the revenues we generate through the use of such assets will be greater than the fixed costs we incur pursuant to the applicable leases or other arrangements  however when such assets are not utilized or are underutilized our profitability could be negatively impacted because the revenues we earn are either nonexistent or reduced but we remain obligated to continue paying any applicable fixed charges in addition to the potential of incurring other costs attributable to the nonutilization of such assets for example in connection with our rail operations we lease a significant number of our railcars typically pursuant to multiyear leases that obligate us to pay the applicable lease rate without regard to utilization  if business conditions are such that a portion of our rail fleet is not utilized for any period of time due to reduced demand for the services they provide we will still be obligated to pay the applicable fixed lease rate for such railcars  in addition during the period of time that we are not utilizing such railcars we will incur incremental costs associated with the cost of storing such railcars and will continue to incur costs for maintenance and upkeep nonutilization of our leased assets in connection with our business could have a significant negative impact on our profitability and cash flows many of our assets have been in service for many years and require significant expenditures to maintain them as a result our maintenance or repair costs may increase in the future our pipelines terminals and storage assets are generally longlived assets and many of them have been in service for many years the age and condition of our assets could result in increased maintenance or repair expenditures in the future any significant increase in these expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations financial position or cash flows as well as our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders for various operating and commercial reasons we may not be able to perform all of our obligations under our contracts which could lead to increased costs and negatively impact our financial results various operational and commercial factors could result in an inability on our part to satisfy our contractual commitments and obligations for example in connection with our provision of firm storage services and hub services to our natural gas storage customers we enter into contracts that obligate us to honor our customers’ requests to inject gas into our storage facilities withdraw gas from our facilities and wheel gas through our facilities in each case subject to volume timing and other limitations set forth in such contracts the following factors could adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations under these contracts • a failure on the part of our storage facilities to perform as we expect them to whether due to malfunction of equipment or facilities or realization of other operational risks  table of contents • the operating pressure of our storage facilities affected in varying degree depending on the type of storage cavern by total volume of working and base gas and temperature • a variety of commercial decisions we make from time to time in connection with the management and operation of our storage facilities examples include without limitation decisions with respect to matters such as i the aggregate amount of commitments we are willing to make with respect to wheeling injection and withdrawal services which could exceed our capabilities at any given time for various reasons ii the timing of scheduled and unplanned maintenance or repairs which can impact equipment availability and capacity iii the schedule for and rate at which we conduct opportunistic leaching activities at our facilities in connection with the expansion of existing salt caverns which can impact the amount of storage capacity we have available to satisfy our customers’ requests iv the timing and aggregate volume of any base gas park andor loan transactions we consummate which can directly affect the operating pressure of our storage facilities and v the amount of compression capacity and other gas handling equipment that we install at our facilities to support gas wheeling injection and withdrawal activities and • adverse operating conditions due to hurricanes extreme weather events or conditions and operational problems or issues with thirdparty pipelines storage or production facilities although we manage and monitor all of these various factors in connection with the ongoing operation of our natural gas storage facilities with the goal of performing all of our contractual commitments and obligations and optimizing our revenue one or more of the above factors may adversely impact our ability to satisfy our injection withdrawal or wheeling obligations under our storage contracts in such event we may be liable to our customers for losses or damages they suffer andor we may need to incur costs or expenses in order to permit us to satisfy our obligations risks inherent in an investment in us cost reimbursements due to our general partner may be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders prior to making any distribution on our common units we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates including officers and directors of the general partner for all expenses incurred on our behalf in addition we are required to pay all direct and indirect expenses of the plains entities other than income taxes of any of the pagp entities the reimbursement of expenses and the payment of fees and expenses could adversely affect our ability to make distributions the general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses in addition our general partner and its affiliates may provide us services for which we will be charged reasonable fees as determined by the general partner cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance and the establishment of financial reserves because distributions on our common units are dependent on the amount of cash we generate distributions may fluctuate based on our performance the actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend on numerous factors some of which are beyond our control and the control of the general partner cash distributions are dependent primarily on cash flow including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings and not solely on profitability which is affected by noncash items therefore cash distributions might be made during periods when we record losses and might not be made during periods when we record profits our preferred units have rights preferences and privileges that are not held by and are preferential to the rights of holders of our common units our series a preferred units our “preferred units” issued in january  rank senior to all of our other classes or series of equity securities with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation these preferences could adversely affect the market price for our common units or could make it more difficult for us to sell our common units in the future in addition distributions on the preferred units accrue and are cumulative at the rate of  per annum on the original issue price and are convertible into common units by the holders of such units or by us in certain circumstances our obligation to pay distributions on our preferred units or on the common units issued following the conversion of such preferred units could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flow available for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities acquisitions and other general partnership purposes our obligations to the holders of preferred units could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  table of contents unitholders may not be able to remove our general partner even if they wish to do so our general partner manages and operates the partnership if unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner they currently have little practical ability to remove our general partner our general partner may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of at least      of our outstanding units including units held by our general partner or its affiliates because the owners of our general partner along with directors and executive officers and their affiliates own a significant percentage of our outstanding common units the removal of our general partner would be difficult without the consent of both our general partner and its affiliates in addition the following provisions of our partnership agreement may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or otherwise change our management • generally if a person acquires  or more of any class of units then outstanding other than from our general partner or its affiliates the units owned by such person cannot be voted on any matter except that such shares constituting up to  of the total shares outstanding may be voted in the election of pagp gp directors and • limitations upon the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations as well as other limitations upon the unitholders’ ability to influence the manner or direction of management as a result of these provisions the price at which our common units will trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price we may issue additional common units without unitholder approval which would dilute a unitholder’s existing ownership interests our general partner may cause us to issue an unlimited number of common units without unitholder approval subject to applicable nyse rules we may also issue at any time an unlimited number of equity securities ranking junior or senior to the common units without unitholder approval subject to applicable nyse rules the issuance of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank may have the following effects • an existing unitholder’s proportionate ownership interest in the partnership will decrease • the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease • the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase • the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished and • the market price of the common units may decline in addition our preferred units are convertible into common units at any time after january   by the holders of such units or under certain circumstances at our option if a substantial portion of the preferred units were converted into common units common unitholders could experience significant dilution in addition if holders of such converted preferred units were to dispose of a substantial portion of these common units in the public market whether in a single transaction or series of transactions it could adversely affect the market price for our common units in addition these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur could make it more difficult for us to sell our common units in the future our general partner has a limited call right that may require unitholders to sell their units at an undesirable time or price if at any time our general partner and its affiliates own  or more of the common units the general partner will have the right but not the obligation which it may assign to any of its affiliates to acquire all but not less than all of the remaining common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price generally equal to the then current market price of the common units as a result unitholders may be required to sell their common units at a time when they may not desire to sell them andor at a price that is less than the price they would like to receive they may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their common units  table of contents unitholders may not have limited liability if a court finds that unitholder actions constitute control of our business and unitholders may have liability to repay distributions under certain circumstances under delaware law a unitholder could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the “control” of our business our general partner generally has unlimited liability for our obligations such as our debts and environmental liabilities except for those contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner our partnership agreement allows the general partner to incur obligations on our behalf that are expressly nonrecourse to the general partner the general partner has entered into such limited recourse obligations in most instances involving payment liability and intends to do so in the future furthermore under section  of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are nonrecourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount conflicts of interest could arise among our general partner and us or the unitholders these conflicts may include the following • under our partnership agreement we reimburse the general partner for the costs of managing and for operating the partnership • the amount of cash expenditures borrowings and reserves in any quarter may affect available cash to pay quarterly distributions to unitholders • the general partner tries to avoid being liable for partnership obligations the general partner is permitted to protect its assets in this manner by our partnership agreement under our partnership agreement the general partner would not breach its fiduciary duty by avoiding liability for partnership obligations even if we can obtain more favorable terms without limiting the general partner’s liability under our partnership agreement the general partner may pay its affiliates for any services rendered on terms fair and reasonable to us the general partner may also enter into additional contracts with any of its affiliates on behalf of us agreements or contracts between us and our general partner and its affiliates are not necessarily the result of arms length negotiations and • the general partner would not breach our partnership agreement by exercising its call rights to purchase limited partnership interests or by assigning its call rights to one of its affiliates or to us the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent a change of control may result in defaults under certain of our debt instruments and the triggering of payment obligations under compensation arrangements our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders furthermore there is no restriction in our partnership agreement on the ability of the general partner of our general partner to transfer its general partnership interest in our general partner to a third party any new owner of our general partner would be able to replace the board of directors and officers with its own choices and to control their decisions and actions in addition a change of control would constitute an event of default under our revolving credit agreements during the continuance of an event of default under our revolving credit agreements the administrative agent may terminate any outstanding commitments of the lenders to extend credit to us under our revolving credit facility andor declare all amounts payable by us under our revolving credit facility immediately due and payable a change of control also may trigger payment obligations under various compensation arrangements with our officers  table of contents risks related to an investment in our debt securities the right to receive payments on our outstanding debt securities is unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness and will be structurally subordinated as to any existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries other than subsidiaries that may guarantee our debt securities in the future our debt securities are effectively subordinated to claims of our secured creditors and to any existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries including trade payables other than subsidiaries that may guarantee our debt securities in the future in the event of the insolvency bankruptcy liquidation reorganization dissolution or winding up of the business of a subsidiary other than a subsidiary that may guarantee our debt securities in the future creditors of that subsidiary would generally have the right to be paid in full before any distribution is made to us or the holders of our debt securities our leverage may limit our ability to borrow additional funds comply with the terms of our indebtedness or capitalize on business opportunities our leverage is significant in relation to our partners’ capital at december    the face value of our total outstanding longterm debt was approximately  billion  and the face value of our total outstanding shortterm debt was approximately  billion  we will be prohibited from making cash distributions during an event of default under any of our indebtedness various limitations in our credit facilities and other debt instruments may reduce our ability to incur additional debt to engage in some transactions and to capitalize on business opportunities any subsequent refinancing of our current indebtedness or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions our leverage could have important consequences to investors in our debt securities we will require substantial cash flow to meet our principal and interest obligations with respect to our debt securities and our other consolidated indebtedness our ability to make scheduled payments to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness or our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors we believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our bank credit facilities to service our indebtedness although the principal amount of our debt securities will likely need to be refinanced at maturity in whole or in part a significant downturn in the hydrocarbon industry or other development adversely affecting our cash flow could materially impair our ability to service our indebtedness if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to refinance all or a portion of our debt or sell assets we can give no assurance that we would be able to refinance our existing indebtedness or sell assets on terms that are commercially reasonable our leverage may adversely affect our ability to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general partnership requirements future acquisition construction or development activities or to otherwise fully realize the value of our assets and opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness or to comply with any restrictive terms of our indebtedness our leverage may also make our results of operations more susceptible to adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and may place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have less debt the ability to transfer our debt securities may be limited by the absence of an organized trading market we do not currently intend to apply for listing of our debt securities on any securities exchange or stock market the liquidity of any market for our debt securities will depend on the number of holders of those debt securities the interest of securities dealers in making a market in those debt securities and other factors accordingly we can give no assurance as to the development continuation or liquidity of any market for the debt securities we have a holding company structure in which our subsidiaries conduct our operations and own our operating assets we are a holding company and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets we have no significant assets other than the ownership interests in our subsidiaries as a result our ability to make required payments on our debt securities depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by among other things credit facilities and applicable state partnership laws and other laws and regulations pursuant to our credit facilities we may be required to establish cash reserves for the future payment of principal and interest on the amounts outstanding under our credit facilities if we are unable to obtain the funds necessary to pay the principal amount at maturity of our debt securities or to repurchase our debt securities  table of contents upon the occurrence of a change of control we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as a refinancing of our debt securities we can give no assurance that we would be able to refinance our debt securities we do not have the same flexibility as other types of organizations to accumulate cash which may limit cash available to service our debt securities or to repay them at maturity unlike a corporation our partnership agreement requires us to distribute on a quarterly basis  of our available cash to our unitholders of record available cash is generally all of our cash receipts adjusted for cash distributions and net changes to reserves our general partner will determine the amount and timing of such distributions and has broad discretion to establish and make additions to our reserves or the reserves of our operating partnerships in amounts the general partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary or appropriate • to provide for the proper conduct of our business and the businesses of our operating partnerships including reserves for future capital expenditures and for our anticipated future credit needs • to provide funds for distributions to our unitholders and the general partner for any one or more of the next four calendar quarters or • to comply with applicable law or any of our loan or other agreements although our payment obligations to our unitholders are subordinate to our payment obligations to debtholders the value of our units will decrease in direct correlation with decreases in the amount we distribute per unit accordingly if we experience a liquidity problem in the future we may not be able to issue equity to recapitalize tax risks to common unitholders our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes as well as our not being subject to a material amount of additional entitylevel taxation by individual states if the internal revenue service “irs” were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or if we become subject to additional amounts of entitylevel taxation for state or foreign tax purposes it would reduce the amount of cash available to pay distributions and our debt obligations the anticipated aftertax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes a publicly traded partnership such as us may be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes unless it satisfies a “qualifying income” requirement as defined in section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the irs issued final regulations on january   that are effective january   that define the activities that generate qualifying income from exploration development mining or production processing refining transportation and marketing of minerals or natural resources within the meaning of section  these regulations are intended to provide regulatory guidance on whether income from activities with respect to minerals or natural resources is qualifying income based on our current operations we believe that we are treated as a partnership rather than a corporation for such purposes however a change in our business could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs on this or any other tax matter affecting us   current law may change causing us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to additional entitylevel taxation in addition several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entitylevel taxation through the imposition of state income franchise and other forms of taxation for example we are subject to entitylevel tax on the portion of our income apportioned to texas imposition of any similar taxes on us in additional states will reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate which is currently a maximum of  and would likely pay state income taxes at varying rates distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions and no income gains losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation the cash available for distributions or to pay our debt obligations would be substantially reduced therefore treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in cash flow and aftertax returns to our unitholders likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entitylevel taxation for federal income tax purposes distribution amounts will be adjusted downward by a percentage that is based on the applicable entitylevel tax rate including both federal and state tax burdens  table of contents the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our units could be subject to potential legislative judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations possibly on a retroactive basis the present us federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships including us or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time for example the obama administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year  recommended that certain publicly traded partnerships earning income from activities related to fossil fuels be taxed as corporations beginning in  from time to time members of congress propose and consider such substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships similar proposals could eliminate the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publiclytraded partnerships as corporations upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes any modification to the us federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units legislative changes to the irs audit rules starting with partnership tax years beginning after  will allow the irs to assess and collect tax on audit adjustments at the partnership level as opposed to the partner level unless the partnership makes an election or exercises certain alternatives changes were also made to limit partner representation in the event of an audit the bipartisan budget act of  hr  “act” effective for partnership tax years beginning after december   repeals the partnership audit rules of the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of  “tefra” and replaces the tefra provisions with new provisions that allow for the irs to assess and collect taxes associated with audit adjustments referred to as an “imputed underpayment” at the partnership entity level rather than the partner level in the year the partnership adjustment is made the “adjustment year” as opposed to the year the adjustment relates the “reviewed year” the imputed underpayment is calculated using the highest tax rate in effect for the reviewed year the implications of an imputed underpayment are that current partners could be liable for a liability of former partners if an audit adjustment did result in a material imputed underpayment the partnership would need to determine whether to pay the imputed underpayment or to avail itself of one of three alternative provisions under the act that can shift the partnership level tax liability back onto the prior tax year partners the first alternative an optout election is not available to us as a publicly traded partnership because we do not meet the criteria of  or fewer partners the second alternative would require the partnership to submit audit adjustment information to the affected partners and to the irs as well as ensure amended return compliance by our partners within  days after receipt of the proposed audit adjustment from an administrative standpoint considering the number of our partners as a publicly traded partnership the second alternative is not a viable option to us the third alternative is an election by us that would require the partnership not later than  days after the date of the notice of final partnership adjustment to furnish to each affected partner and to the irs a statement of each partner’s share of any adjustment to income gain loss deduction or credit under this alternative reviewed year partners calculate their share of additional tax due and pay the additional amount with their respective current year individual tax returns an election under this provision however because the reviewed year is older increases the applicable imputed underpayment interest rate by two percentage points if we are required to pay taxes penalties and interest as the result of audit adjustments cash available for distribution to our unitholders may be substantially reduced in addition because payment would be due for the taxable year in which the audit is completed unitholders during that taxable year would bear the expense of the adjustment even if they were not unitholders during the audited taxable year also for partnership tax years beginning after  the act eliminated rights that certain individual partners might previously have had in the audit process by now restricting it to a single “partnership representative” the sale or exchange of  or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelvemonth period will result in our termination as a partnership for federal income tax purposes we will be considered to have constructively terminated as a partnership for tax purposes if there are sales or exchanges which in the aggregate constitute  or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelvemonth period for purposes of measuring whether the  threshold is reached multiple sales of the same interest are counted only once our termination would among other things result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders which would result in our filing two tax returns for one fiscal year and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income in the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a calendar year the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable income for the year of termination our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal  table of contents income tax purposes but it would result in our being treated as a new partnership for tax purposes if we were treated as a new partnership we would be required to make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we were unable to determine that a termination occurred the irs has recently announced a relief procedure whereby if a publicly traded partnership that has technically terminated requests and the irs grants special relief among other things the partnership may be permitted to provide only a single schedule k to unitholders for the tax years in which the termination occurs if the irs or canada revenue agency “cra” contests the federal income tax positions or intercountry allocations we take the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any irs or cra contest or incremental taxes paid will reduce our cash available for distribution or debt service the irs has made no determination as to our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or as to any other matter affecting us the irs or cra may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take or challenge the intercountry allocations we make it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take a court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take any contest with the irs or cra may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade in addition our costs of any contest with the irs or cra and any incremental taxes required to be paid will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution or debt service our unitholders may be required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us because our unitholders will be treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income that could be different in amount than the cash we distribute they will be required to pay any federal income taxes and in some cases state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income even if they receive no cash distributions from us unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income taxable gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected if our unitholders sell their common units they will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those common units because distributions in excess of a unitholder’s allocable share of our net taxable income decrease the unitholder’s tax basis in their common units the amount of any such prior excess distributions with respect to their units will in effect become taxable income to the unitholder if the common units are sold at a price greater than the unitholder’s tax basis in those common units even if the price the unitholder receives is less than the unitholder’s original cost furthermore a substantial portion of the amount realized whether or not representing gain may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items including depreciation recapture in addition because the amount realized includes a unitholder’s share of our nonrecourse liabilities if a unitholder sells units the unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received from the sale taxexempt entities and nonus persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them investment in common units by taxexempt entities such as employee benefit plans and iras and nonus persons raises issues unique to them for example virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax including iras and other retirement plans will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them distributions to nonus persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate and nonus persons will be required to file us federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income nonus persons will also potentially have tax filing and payment obligations in additional jurisdictions taxexempt entities and nonus persons should consult their tax advisor before investing in our common units we treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual units purchased the irs may challenge this treatment which could adversely affect the value of our common units because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units we have adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders’ tax returns  table of contents our unitholders will likely be subject to state local and nonus taxes and return filing requirements in states and jurisdictions where they do not live as a result of investing in our units in addition to us federal income taxes our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes including state and local taxes unincorporated business taxes and estate inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future even if our unitholders do not live in any of those jurisdictions our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions further our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements we currently own property and conduct business in most states in the united states most of which impose a personal income tax on individuals and an income tax on corporations and other entities it is our unitholders’ responsibility to file all us federal state local and nonus tax returns as applicable we have adopted certain valuation methodologies in determining unitholder’s allocations of income gain loss and deduction the irs may challenge these methods or the resulting allocations and such a challenge could adversely affect the value of our common units in determining the items of income gain loss and deduction allocable to our unitholders we must routinely determine the fair market value of our respective assets although we may from time to time consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters we make fair market value estimates using a methodology based on the market value of our common units as a means to measure the fair market value of our respective assets the irs may challenge these valuation methods and the resulting allocations of income gain loss and deduction a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount character and timing of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders it also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders’ sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders’ tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions a unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan eg a loan to a “short seller” to cover a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of those common units if so he would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition because there are no specific rules governing the federal income tax consequences of loaning a partnership interest a unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units  in that case the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition moreover during the period of the loan any of our income gain loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units may be fully taxable as ordinary income unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller should modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their common units we prorate our items of income gain loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred the irs may challenge this treatment which could change the allocation of items of income gain loss and deduction among our unitholders we generally prorate our items of income gain loss and deduction between existing unitholders and unitholders who purchase our units based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred  the use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations recently the us treasury department issued proposed treasury regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items nonetheless the proposed regulations do not specifically authorize the use of the proration method we have adopted  if the irs were to challenge our proration method or new treasury regulations were issued we may be required to change the allocation of

policies and estimates • recent accounting pronouncements • results of operations • market overview and outlook • liquidity and capital resources executive summary company overview we own and operate midstream energy infrastructure and provide logistics services for crude oil ngl natural gas and refined products we own an extensive network of pipeline transportation terminalling storage and gathering assets in key crude oil and ngl producing basins and transportation corridors and at major market hubs in the united states and canada we were formed in  and our operations are conducted directly and indirectly through our operating subsidiaries and are managed through three operating segments transportation facilities and supply and logistics see “— results of operations — analysis of operating segments ” for further discussion  table of contents overview of operating results capital investments and other significant activities the transitioning crude oil market over the last two years created a challenging environment for the overall midstream industry see the “—market overview and outlook” section below for further discussion we recognized net income attributable to paa of  million in  as compared to net income attributable to paa of  million recognized in   this yearoveryear decrease was impacted by • lower operating results primarily due to less favorable crude oil and ngl market conditions increased competition and the impact of marktomarket losses on certain derivative instruments partially offset by i contributions from our recently completed acquisition and capital expansion projects and ii lower field operating costs largely due to lower trucking costs associated with our supply and logistics activities and the absence of costs related to the line  incident which occurred in may  • higher depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulting from i our recently completed capital expansion projects ii impairment losses related to certain of our rail and other terminal assets and iii assets taken out of service and the discontinuation of certain capital projects all partially offset by net gains related to noncore assets sales and joint venture formations completed during the  period • higher interest expense primarily related to financing activities associated with our capital investments • gains recognized during  related to the marktomarket impact of our preferred distribution rate reset option and • lower income tax expense primarily due to lower earnings from our canadian operations and the impact from the cumulative revaluation of canadian net deferred tax liabilities resulting from an alberta canada provincial tax rate increase enacted during the comparative  period see further discussion of our segment operating results in the “— results of operations — analysis of operating segments ” and “— other income and expenses ” sections below we executed a  billion capital program during   which we expect will contribute to growth in our feebased transportation and facilities segments in future years in addition we paid approximately  billion of cash distributions to our common unitholders and general partner during   to improve our ability to manage through the industry downturn and to position for a recovery we completed a number of initiatives during  to maintain a solid capital structure significant liquidity and overall financial flexibility such initiatives included i executing the simplification transactions in november  which lowered our incremental cost of equity through the elimination of our idrs and in connection therewith resetting our distribution level which resulted in an annual reduction in cash distributions of approximately  million ii securing approximately  billion of equity capital through the sale of new series a preferred units in january  iii selectively utilizing our continuous offering program to raise approximately  million of net proceeds iv selling noncore assets and entering into strategic joint ventures which raised approximately  million of cash proceeds during  while reducing our capital commitments and v entering into a definitive agreement to sell additional assets for approximately  million that is expected to close in the first half of  subject to regulatory approvals  subsequent to december   we acquired a crude oil gathering system located in the northern delaware basin for approximately  billion in addition in february  we entered into a definitive agreement to form a  joint venture to acquire a crude oil pipeline located in the southern delaware basin for  million we also entered into definitive sales agreements for two transactions totaling  million and we completed a third transaction the sale of a partial interest in a pipeline segment in january  for proceeds of  million we expect the remaining transactions to close during the first half of  subject to customary closing conditions including receipt of regulatory approvals  table of contents acquisitions and capital projects we completed a number of acquisitions and capital projects in    and  that have impacted our results of operations

expenditures for the replacement of partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the operating andor earnings capacity of our existing assets are classified as maintenance capital acquisitions acquisitions are financed using a combination of equity and debt including borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit facilities and the issuance of senior notes in addition we use proceeds from sales of noncore assets for funding businesses acquired impact our results of operations commencing on the closing date of each acquisition our acquisition divestiture and capital

canada rail projects    represents contributions related to our  investment interest in saddlehorn    represents contributions related to our  investment interest our recent expansion capital programs were primarily driven by investment in midstream infrastructure projects to address the need for additional takeaway capacity in regions impacted by the increase in crude oil and liquidsrich gas production growth in north america as well as the longterm needs of both the upstream and downstream sectors of the crude oil space a majority of the expansion capital spent in the years presented was invested in our feebased transportation and facilities segments however the meaningful decrease in crude oil prices since the second half of  led to production declines and infrastructure overbuild in a number of onshore resource plays as such we have reduced our forecasted capital expansion program in  relative to prior years we currently expect to spend approximately  million for expansion capital in   see “— liquidity and capital resources — acquisitions divestitures and expansion capital expenditures —  capital projects ” and “— market overview and outlook ” for additional information critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap these critical accounting policies are discussed in note  to our consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and rules and regulations of the sec requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period although we believe these estimates are reasonable actual results could  table of contents differ from these estimates on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates  we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for our i estimated fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and identification of associated goodwill and intangible assets ii fair value of derivatives iii accruals and contingent liabilities iv equityindexed compensation plan accruals v property and equipment depreciation expense and asset retirement obligations vi allowance for doubtful accounts and vii inventory valuations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates  such critical accounting estimates are discussed further as follows fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and identification of associated goodwill and intangible assets   in accordance with fasb guidance regarding business combinations with each acquisition we allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition if the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete when the combination occurs an estimate will be recorded  any subsequent adjustments to this estimate if material will be recognized retroactive to the date of acquisition with exception to acquisitions of equity method investments we also expense the transaction costs as incurred in connection with each acquisition in addition we are required to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life as determined by management goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically assessed for impairment determining the fair value of assets and

financial statements for further discussion of goodwill fair value of derivatives the fair value of a derivative at a particular period end does not reflect the end results of a particular transaction and will most likely not reflect the gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction we reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties we have commodity derivatives interest rate derivatives and foreign currency derivatives that are accounted for as assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets the valuations of our derivatives that are exchange traded are based on market prices on the applicable exchange on the last day of the period for our derivatives that are not exchange traded the estimates we use are based on indicative broker quotations or an internal valuation model our valuation models utilize market observable inputs such as price volatility correlation and other factors and may not be reflective of the price at which they can be settled due to the lack of a liquid market less than  of total annual revenues are based on estimates derived from internal valuation models we also have embedded derivatives in our preferred units that are accounted for as assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets derivatives related to the embedded derivatives in our preferred units are valued using a model that contains inputs including our common unit price tenyear us treasury rates default probabilities and timing estimates which involve management judgment

governmental fines and penalties potential legal claims and fees for legal services associated with loss contingencies and bonuses accruals are made when our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated our estimates are based on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome among the many uncertainties that impact our estimates are the necessary regulatory approvals for and potential modification of our environmental remediation plans the limited amount of  table of contents data available upon initial assessment of the impact of soil or water contamination changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment the duration of the natural resource damage assessment and the ultimate amount of damages determined the determination and calculation of fines and penalties the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to additional claims and the nature extent and cost of legal services that will be required in connection with lawsuits claims and other matters our estimates for contingent liability accruals are increased or decreased as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved a hypothetical variance of  in our aggregate estimate for the accruals and contingent liabilities discussed above would have an impact on

expense asset retirement obligations and impairments we compute depreciation using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives these estimates are based on various factors including condition manufacturing specifications technological advances and historical data concerning useful lives of similar assets uncertainties that impact these estimates include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration and abandonment requirements economic conditions and supply and demand in the area when assets are put into service we make estimates with respect to useful lives and salvage values that we believe are reasonable however subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization we record retirement obligations associated with tangible longlived assets based on estimates related to the costs associated with cleaning purging and in some cases completely removing the assets and returning the land to its original state in addition our estimates include a determination of the settlement date or dates for the potential obligation which may or may not be determinable uncertainties that impact these estimates include the costs associated with these activities and the timing of incurring such costs we periodically evaluate property and equipment for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable any evaluation is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions of related cash flows we consider the fair value estimate used to calculate impairment of property and equipment a critical accounting estimate in determining the existence of an impairment of carrying value we make a number of subjective assumptions as to   • whether there is an event or circumstance that may be indicative of an impairment • the grouping of assets • the intention of “holding” “abandoning” or “selling” an asset • the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset’s estimated useful life and • if an impairment exists the fair value of the asset or asset group as discussed in the “market overview and outlook” section below the decline in crude oil prices and its impact on certain differentials and downward pressure on production that has occurred since mid has adversely impacted most companies in the midstream industry including us as a result of such adverse market conditions during  we recognized approximately  million of noncash impairment losses on certain of our longlived rail and other terminal assets included in  table of contents our facilities segment despite the modest recovery in the crude oil market in recent months we continue to monitor appropriate indicators of potential impairment we did not recognize any material impairment of longlived assets during the year ended december   during the year ended december   we recognized impairments of  million primarily related to assets that were taken out of service see note  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding impairments allowance for doubtful accounts  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and grant credit based on past payment history financial conditions and anticipated industry conditions customer payments are regularly monitored and a provision for doubtful accounts is established based on specific situations and overall industry conditions our history of bad debt losses has been minimal less than  million in the aggregate over the years ended

additional discussion inventory valuations  inventory including longterm inventory primarily consists of crude oil ngl and natural gas and is valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using an average cost method within specific inventory pools at the end of each reporting period we assess the carrying value of our inventory and use estimates and judgment when making any adjustments necessary to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value among the uncertainties that impact our estimates are the applicable quality and location differentials to include in our net realizable value analysis additionally we estimate the upcoming liquidation timing of the inventory changes in assumptions made as to the timing of a sale can materially impact net realizable value

those that our codm believes impact comparability of results across periods see note  to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of such adjustments  table of contents nongaap financial measures to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with gaap management uses additional measures known as “nongaap financial measures” in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future the primary additional measures used by management are earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization including our proportionate share of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated entities and adjusted for certain selected items impacting comparability “adjusted ebitda” and implied distributable cash flow “dcf” management believes that the presentation of such additional financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because these measures when used to supplement related gaap financial measures i provide additional information about our core operating performance and ability to fund distributions to our unitholders through cash generated by our operations ii provide investors with the same financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial operational compensation and planningbudgeting decisions and iii present measurements that investors rating agencies and debt holders have indicated are useful in assessing us and our results of operations these nongaap measures may exclude for example i charges for obligations that are expected to be settled with the issuance of equity instruments ii the marktomarket of derivative instruments that are related to underlying activities in another period or the reversal of such

depreciation and amortization  table of contents expense associated with such unconsolidated entities is excluded when reviewing adjusted ebitda similar to our consolidated pipelines    we use derivative instruments for risk management purposes and our related processes include specific identification of hedging instruments to an underlying hedged transaction although we identify an underlying transaction for each derivative instrument we enter into there may not be an accounting hedge relationship between the instrument and the underlying transaction in the course of evaluating our results of operations we identify the earnings that were recognized during the period related to derivative instruments for which the identified underlying transaction does not occur in the current period and exclude the related gains and losses in determining adjusted ebitda in addition we exclude gains and losses on derivatives that are related to investing activities such as the purchase of linefill we also exclude the impact of corresponding inventory valuation adjustments as applicable as well as the marktomarket adjustment related to our preferred distribution rate reset option see note  to our consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive discussion regarding our derivatives and risk management activities    we have certain agreements that require counterparties to deliver transport or throughput a minimum volume over an agreed upon period substantially all of such agreements were entered into with counterparties to economically support the return on our capital expenditure necessary to construct the related asset some of these agreements include makeup rights if the minimum volume is not met we record a receivable from the counterparty in the period that services are provided or when the transaction occurs including amounts for deficiency obligations from counterparties associated with minimum volume commitments if a counterparty has a makeup right associated with a deficiency we defer the revenue attributable to the counterparty’s makeup right and subsequently recognize the revenue at the earlier of when the deficiency volume is delivered or shipped when the makeup right expires or when it is determined that the counterparty’s ability to utilize the makeup right is remote we include the impact of amounts billed to counterparties for their deficiency obligation net of applicable amounts subsequently recognized into revenue as a selected item impacting comparability we believe the inclusion of the contractually committed revenues associated with that period is meaningful to investors as the related asset has been constructed is standing ready to provide the committed service and the fixed operating costs are included in the current period results amounts for years prior to  were not significant    we carry crude oil and ngl inventory that is comprised of minimum working inventory requirements in thirdparty assets and other working inventory that is needed for our commercial operations  we consider this inventory necessary to conduct our operations and we intend to carry this inventory for the foreseeable future therefore we classify this inventory as longterm on our balance sheet and do not hedge the inventory with derivative instruments similar to linefill in our own assets we treat the impact of changes in the average cost of the longterm inventory that result from fluctuations in market prices and writedowns of such inventory that result from price declines as a selected item impacting comparability see note  to our consolidated financial statements for additional inventory disclosures    our total equityindexed compensation expense includes expense associated with awards that will or may be settled in units and awards that will or may be settled in cash the awards that will or may be settled in units are included in our diluted net income per unit calculation when the applicable performance criteria have been met we consider the compensation expense associated with these awards as a selected item impacting comparability as the dilutive impact of the outstanding awards is included in our diluted net income per unit calculation as applicable and the majority of the awards are expected to be settled in units the portion of compensation expense associated with awards that are certain to be settled in cash is not considered a selected item impacting comparability see note  to our consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive discussion regarding our equityindexed compensation plans    during the periods presented there were fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar “cad” to the us dollar “usd” resulting in gains and losses that were not related to our core operating results for the period and were thus classified as a selected item impacting comparability see note  to our consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding our

logistics our codm our chief executive officer evaluates segment performance based on a variety of measures including segment adjusted ebitda segment volumes segment adjusted ebitda per barrel and maintenance capital investment during the fourth quarter of  we modified our primary segment performance measure to segment adjusted ebitda from segment profit and thus prior period segment disclosures have been recast to reflect this change segment adjusted ebitda forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is the measure of segment performance that is utilized by our codm in assessing performance and allocating resources among our operating segments such recasts have no impact on previously reported consolidated financial results we define segment adjusted ebitda as revenues and equity earnings in unconsolidated entities less a purchases and related costs b field operating costs and c segment general and administrative expenses plus our proportionate share of the depreciation and amortization expense of unconsolidated entities and further adjusted for certain selected items including i the marktomarket of derivative instruments that are related to underlying activities in another period or the reversal of such adjustments from a prior period gains and losses on derivatives that are related to investing activities such as the purchase of linefill and inventory valuation adjustments as applicable ii longterm inventory costing adjustments iii charges for obligations that are expected to be settled with the issuance of equity instruments iv amounts related to deficiencies associated with minimum volume commitments net of applicable amounts subsequently recognized into revenue and v other items that our codm believes are integral to understand our core segment operating performance see note  to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to paa our segment analysis involves an element of judgment relating to the allocations between segments in connection with its operations the supply and logistics segment secures transportation and facilities services from our other two segments as well as thirdparty service providers under monthtomonth and multiyear arrangements intersegment transportation service rates are conducted at posted tariff rates rates similar to those charged to third parties or rates that we believe approximate market facilities segment services are also obtained at rates generally consistent with rates charged to third parties for similar services however certain terminalling and storage rates are discounted to our supply and logistics segment to reflect the fact that these services may be canceled on short notice to enable the facilities segment to provide services to third parties intersegment activities are eliminated in consolidation and we believe that the estimates with respect to these rates are reasonable also our segment operating and general and administrative expenses reflect direct costs attributable to each segment however we also allocate certain operating expenses and general and administrative overhead expenses between segments based on management’s assessment of the business activities for the period the proportional allocations by segment require judgment by management and may be adjusted in the future based on the business activities that exist during each period we believe that the estimates with respect to these allocations are reasonable revenues and expenses from our canadian based subsidiaries which use cad as their functional currency are translated at the prevailing average exchange rates for each month  table of contents transportation segment our transportation segment

periods indicated revenues and volumes   variances in revenues and average monthly volumes for the comparative periods were primarily driven by • ngl storage ngl fractionation and canadian gas processing — revenues increased by  million for the year ended december   over the same  period primarily due to i contributions from the western canada ngl assets we acquired in august  ii contributions from ongoing expansion projects at our fort saskatchewan facility and iii higher fees at certain of our ngl storage and fractionation facilities such increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuation impacts of  million which were largely offset in our supply and logistics segment results revenues decreased by  million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   this decrease was primarily due to estimated unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuation impacts of  million which offset revenue increases from higher facility fees for the  period these impacts were largely offset in our supply and logistics segment results • crude oil storage — revenues increased by  million for the year ended december   over the year ended december   primarily due to i aggregate capacity expansions of approximately  million barrels at our st james and cushing terminals and ii increased utilization at certain of our west coast terminals such increases were partially offset by lower results due to the sale of certain of our east coast terminals in april  for the year ended december   revenues increased by  million over the year ended december   primarily due to capacity expansions of approximately  million barrels and higher marine access activity at our st james terminal • rail terminals — revenues decreased by  million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to i lower volumes at our us terminals as a result of production declines in the bakken and less favorable market conditions partially offset by i revenue associated with minimum volume commitments at certain of our terminals and ii revenues and volumes from our canadian ngl rail terminal that came online in april  for the year ended december   revenues decreased by  million compared to the year ended december   due to lower volumes and lower rail fees related to the movement of certain volumes of bakken crude oil partially offset by revenues from our bakersfield rail terminal that came online in the fourth quarter of  • gulf coast gas processing — revenues decreased by  million for the year ended december

same  period • natural gas storage operations — net revenues decreased by  million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to i declines in market rates for natural gas storage which resulted in lower rates on new contracts replacing expiring contracts and ii reduced hub services opportunities in addition the  period was unfavorably impacted by costs

year ended december   compared to the same  period field operating costs field operating costs excluding equityindexed compensation expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same

compensation expense see “—analysis of operating segments—transportation segment” for discussion of equityindexed compensation expense for the periods presented maintenance capital the decrease in maintenance capital for  compared to  was primarily due to lower spending on various tank and other maintenance capital projects partially due to the timing of certain  projects at our ngl storage and

         because the commodities that we buy and sell are generally indexed to the same pricing indices for both sales and purchases revenues and costs related to purchases will fluctuate with market prices however the margins related to those sales and purchases will not necessarily have a corresponding increase or decrease the absolute amount of our revenues and purchases decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and the year ended december   compared to the same  period primarily due to lower crude oil and ngl prices during the period generally we expect a base level of earnings from our supply and logistics segment from the assets employed by this segment this base level may be optimized and enhanced when there is a high level of market volatility favorable basis differentials andor a steep contango or backwardated market structure during certain transitional periods such as the current extended period of lower crude oil prices our ability to generate above baselevel earnings is challenging and taking into account the overcapacity of midstream assets and increased competition that currently exists in most crude oil producing regions generating even baselinelevel performance is challenging our ngl operations are also impacted by similar competitive pressures in addition our ngl operations are sensitive to weatherrelated demand particularly during the approximate fivemonth peak heating season of november through march and temperature differences from periodtoperiod may have a significant effect on ngl demand and thus our financial performance the following is a discussion of items impacting supply and logistics segment operating results for the periods indicated net revenues and volumes our supply and logistics segment revenues net of purchases and related costs decreased by  million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   of which  million was related to the marktomarket impact of certain derivatives and longterm inventory costing adjustments revenues net of purchases and related costs decreased by  million for the year ended december   compared to the same  period of which  million was related to the marktomarket impact of certain derivatives and longterm inventory costing adjustments the following summarizes the significant items impacting the comparative periods • crude oil operations — net revenues from our crude oil supply and logistics operations decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to continued and intensifying competition largely due to overbuilt infrastructure underwritten with volume commitments and the effect of such on differentials as well as volume declines in certain areas which negatively impacted our unit margins see the “market overview and outlook” section below for additional discussion of recent market conditions net revenues decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to i the compression of certain differentials during the  period which resulted in fewer opportunities to capture abovebaseline margins as compared to  and ii increased competition largely due to overbuilt infrastructure in certain areas that has negatively impacted our lease gathering unit margins and volumes most notably during the second half of  however such unfavorable results were partially offset by revenues from opportunities created by the contango market structure during  • ngl operations — net revenues from our ngl operations decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   largely due to i higher storage and processing fees for the  periods which are primarily reflected in our facilities segment and ii higher supply costs driven by competition which more than offset higher sales volumes net revenues increased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   the increase was primarily driven by higher margins due to the lower cost of inventory carried over from  year end and higher sales volumes  table of contents • impact from certain derivative activities net of inventory valuation adjustments — the marktomarket of certain of our derivative activities impacting our net revenues includes marktomarket and other gains and losses resulting from certain derivative instruments that are related to underlying activities in another period or the reversal of marktomarket gains and losses from a prior period gains and losses on certain derivatives that are related to investing activities such as the purchase of linefill and inventory valuation adjustments as applicable see note  to our consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive discussion regarding our derivatives and risk management activities • longterm inventory costing adjustments — our net revenues are impacted by changes in the weighted average cost of our crude oil and ngl inventory pools that result from price movements during the periods these costing adjustments related to longterm inventory necessary to meet our minimum inventory requirements in thirdparty assets and other working inventory that was needed for our commercial operations we consider this inventory necessary to conduct our operations and we intend to carry this inventory for the foreseeable future • foreign exchange impacts — our net revenues are impacted by fluctuations in the value of cad to usd resulting in foreign exchange gains and losses on us denominated net assets within our canadian operations in addition the depreciation of cad relative to usd resulted in lower net usd costs of approximately  million for  compared to  and  million for  compared to  such costs are primarily associated with intercompany facility fees and are largely offset in our facilities segment results field operating costs  field operating costs excluding equityindexed compensation expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same  period primarily due to a combination of i lower lease gathering volumes ii shorter truck hauls and reduced use of thirdparty trucking services as pipeline expansion projects were placed into service iii lower driver wages and iv a decrease in fuel prices the decrease in field operating costs excluding equityindexed compensation

each of the years ended december    and  was primarily comprised of foreign currency gains or losses related to revaluations of caddenominated interest receivables associated with our intercompany notes income tax expense income tax expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to lower yearoveryear income as impacted by fluctuations in derivative marktomarket valuations in our canadian operations during the  period and the cumulative revaluation of canadian net deferred tax liabilities resulting from a  alberta canada provincial tax increase in the second quarter of  the decrease in income tax expense for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to the deferred income tax impact associated with fluctuations in the derivative marktomarket valuation in our canadian operations during the  and  periods this benefit was partially offset by an alberta canada provincial tax rate increase of  enacted during the second quarter of  as well as higher current income tax expense resulting from increased yearoveryear taxable earnings from our canadian operations the  period was also favorably impacted by the depreciation of cad relative to usd  table of contents market overview and outlook for the last six years crude oil markets have been fairly volatile with significant swings in both prices and production levels coupled with relatively modest growth in global liquids demand the period from  through  was generally characterized by i high commodity prices driving a significant increase in north american production volumes  million barrels per day or  including significantly increased production of light crudes and condensate ii high levels of volatility in location and quality differentials and iii high utilization of then existing pipeline and terminal infrastructure these factors stimulated multiple industry initiatives to build new pipeline and terminal infrastructure ultimately resulting in excess midstream capacity in the permian eagle ford williston midcontinent and dj basins many of the new infrastructure projects constructed during this period are supported by longterm minimum volume commitments “mvcs” whereby the shipper often a producer with expectations of continued production or volume growth and the desire to secure associated takeaway capacity agreed to ship and pay for certain stated volumes the period of high commodity prices and increased production from  through  led to an oversupply of north american and global petroleum liquids which resulted in a meaningful decrease in crude oil prices during the second half of  and throughout  and  relative to the levels experienced during the first half of  in turn this resulted in a decrease in north american production levels in many areas as producers took rigs out of service and deferred completions at an increased rate as a result many of the producers and shippers that had previously entered into mvcs found themselves short of the volumes they needed to fulfill their mvcs resulting in increased competition for the marginal uncommitted barrel the combination of the slowdown in north american crude oil production growth and significant mvcs for new infrastructure created an environment for our business in which margins have compressed and differentials are less than transportation cost in some cases in  the market remained oversupplied but global demand growth began to outpace global supply growth as nonopec production declined in november  opec indicated a desire to return to its historical strategy of managing crude oil production levels joined by certain nonopec countries such as russia and mexico opec and nonopec participants have targeted to cut output by approximately  million barrels per day in the first half of  this decision drove a significant increase in crude oil prices during the fourth quarter of  to the extent the production cut is successfully executed by the participating countries accumulated inventories should begin to decline prices should remain firm and potentially rise ultimately leading to increased drilling and production activity levels if the production cut is not executed inventories could rise and prices could decline ultimately leading to reduced drilling and production activity levels the recent increase in crude oil prices has led to increased rig activity in a few areas where we anticipate production levels to increase most notably the permian basin and the stack resource play in oklahoma if production growth resumes and pipeline utilization increases differentials should improve and approach transportation cost on a regional basis while we believe that challenging industry conditions will persist in the near term especially given the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which the proposed production cut by opec and other nonopec countries is implemented we anticipate improvements in market conditions and production growth in the lower  states during the latter half of  and into      however we can provide no assurance that the improvement in market conditions will be achieved or that we will not be negatively impacted by declining crude oil supply lower commodity prices reduced producer activity levels competition for incremental volumes reduced margins low levels of volatility challenging capital markets conditions or other related factors additionally construction of additional infrastructure by us and our competitors could lead to even greater levels of excess takeaway capacity in certain areas for the near to mediumterm which could further reduce unit margins in our various segments and which could be exacerbated by declining levels of crude oil production finally we cannot be certain that our expansion efforts will generate targeted returns or that any recently completed or future acquisition activities will be successful see item a “ risk factors — risks related to our business ” liquidity and capital resources general our primary sources of liquidity are i cash flow from operating activities as further discussed below in the section entitled “— cash flow from operating activities ” ii borrowings under our credit facilities or commercial paper program and iii funds received from sales of equity and debt securities in addition we may supplement these sources of liquidity with proceeds from a program we initiated to evaluate potential sales of noncore assets andor sales of partial interests in assets to strategic joint venture partners our primary cash requirements include but are not limited to i ordinary course of business uses such as the payment of amounts related to the purchase of crude oil ngl and other products and other expenses and interest payments on outstanding debt ii expansion and maintenance activities iii acquisitions of assets or businesses iv repayment of principal on our longterm debt and v distributions to our unitholders we generally expect to fund our  table of contents shortterm cash requirements through cash flow generated from operating activities andor borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit facilities in addition we generally expect to fund our longterm needs such as those resulting from expansion activities or acquisitions and refinancing our longterm debt through a variety of sources either separately or in combination which may include the sources mentioned above as funding for shortterm needs andor the issuance of additional equity or debt securities as of december    we had a working capital deficit of  million and approximately  billion of liquidity available to meet our ongoing operating investing and financing needs subject to continued covenant compliance as noted below in millions   as of december   availability under senior unsecured revolving credit facility     availability under senior secured hedged inventory facility    availability under senior unsecured day revolving credit facility  amounts outstanding under commercial paper program   subtotal  cash and cash equivalents  total        represents availability prior to giving effect to amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program which reduce available capacity under the facilities    available capacity under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the senior secured hedged inventory facility was reduced by outstanding letters of credit of  million and  million respectively we repaid  million of senior notes in january  and we completed an approximate  billion acquisition in february  both of which were initially funded with borrowings under our credit facilities and cash on hand we received approximately  million of net proceeds from sales of our common units in january  which sales were completed under our continuous offering program and pursuant to the omnibus agreement with aap and pagp see further discussion in “equity and debt financing activities” and “ acquisitions divestitures and expansion capital expenditures ” below we believe that we have and will continue to have the ability to access the commercial paper program and credit facilities which we use to meet our shortterm cash needs we believe that our financial position remains strong and we have sufficient liquidity however extended disruptions in the financial markets andor energy price volatility that adversely affect our business may have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows also see item a “ risk factors ” for further discussion regarding such risks that may impact our liquidity and capital resources usage of the credit facilities which provide the backstop for the commercial paper program is subject to ongoing compliance with covenants as of december    we were in compliance with all such covenants cash flow from operating activities the primary drivers of cash flow from operating activities are i the collection of amounts related to the sale of crude oil ngl and other products the transportation of crude oil and other products for a fee and storage and terminalling services provided for a fee and ii the payment of amounts related to the purchase of crude oil ngl and other products and other expenses principally field operating costs general and administrative expenses and interest expense cash flow from operating activities can be materially impacted by the storage of crude oil in periods of a contango market when the price of crude oil for future deliveries is higher than current prices in the month we pay for the stored crude oil we borrow under our credit facilities or commercial paper program or use cash on hand to pay for the crude oil which negatively impacts operating cash flow conversely cash flow from operating activities increases during the period in which we collect the cash from the sale of the stored crude oil similarly the level of ngl and other product inventory stored and held for resale at period end affects our cash flow from operating activities in periods when the market is not in contango we typically sell our crude oil during the same month in which we purchase it and we do not rely on borrowings under our credit facilities or commercial paper program to pay for the crude oil during such market conditions our accounts payable and accounts receivable generally move in tandem as we make payments and receive payments for the purchase and sale of crude oil in the same month which is the month following such activity in periods during which we build inventory regardless of market structure we may rely on our credit facilities or commercial  table of contents paper program to pay for the inventory in addition we use derivative instruments to manage the risks associated with the purchase and sale of our commodities therefore our cash flow from operating activities may be impacted by the margin deposit requirements related to our derivative activities see note  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding our derivatives and risk management activities net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december     and  was approximately  million   billion and  billion  respectively and primarily resulted from earnings from our operations additionally as discussed further below changes in our inventory levels during these years impacted our cash flow from operating activities during  we increased our inventory levels and margin balances required as part of our hedging activities that were funded by shortterm debt resulting in an unfavorable impact on our cash provided by operating activities furthermore cash provided by operating activities as compared to prior periods was unfavorably impacted by the decrease in cash from overall earnings during  we increased the amount of our inventory however these volumetric increases were largely offset by lower prices for our inventory stored at the end of the year compared to prior year amounts during  we decreased the volume of our crude oil inventory that we held the decreased inventory levels were further impacted by lower prices for such inventory stored at the end of the year compared to prior year amounts in addition our margin balances fluctuated from a net cash outflow to a net cash inflow a portion of the net proceeds received from the liquidation of such inventory and the positive cash flow associated with our margin balance activities were used to repay borrowings under our commercial paper program and favorably impacted cash flow from operating activities these overall decreases were partially offset by an increase in the amount of ngl inventory stored at december   compared to prior year amounts which was primarily financed through borrowings under our commercial paper program credit agreements commercial paper program and indentures at december    we had four primary credit arrangements these include a  billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in  a  billion senior secured hedged inventory facility maturing in  and a  billion day senior unsecured credit facility maturing in august  additionally we have a  billion unsecured commercial paper program that is backstopped by our revolving credit facility and our hedged inventory facility our credit agreements which impact our ability to access our commercial paper program because they provide the backstop that supports our shortterm credit ratings and the indentures governing our senior notes contain crossdefault provisions a default under our credit agreements would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the outstanding debt as long as we are in compliance with the provisions in our credit agreements our ability to make distributions of available cash is not restricted we were in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit agreements and indentures as of december         during the year ended december   we had net repayments on our credit facilities and commercial paper program of  million the net repayments resulted primarily from cash flow from operating activities as well as cash received from our equity issuances and asset divestitures which offset borrowings during the period related to funding needs for i inventory purchases and related margin balances required as part of our hedging activities ii capital investments iii repayment of our  million senior notes in august  iv repayment of  million of borrowings that we assumed under aap’s senior secured credit agreement in connection with the simplification transactions and v other general partnership purposes during the year ended december   we had net borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program of  million these net borrowings resulted primarily from funding needs for i capital investments ii repayment of senior notes that matured during  and iii other general partnership purposes and were partially offset by repayments from cash received from our debt and equity issuances equity and debt financing activities our financing activities primarily relate to funding expansion capital projects acquisitions and refinancing of our debt maturities as well as shortterm working capital and hedged inventory borrowings related to our ngl business and contango market activities  our financing activities have primarily consisted of equity offerings senior notes offerings and borrowings and repayments under our credit

divestitures and expansion capital expenditures in addition to our operating needs discussed above we also use cash for our acquisition activities and expansion capital projects historically we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash generated by operations and the financing activities discussed above in the near term we also intend to use proceeds from our asset sales program as discussed further below also see “— acquisitions and capital projects ” for further discussion of such capital expenditures acquisitions   the price of acquisitions includes cash paid assumed liabilities and net working capital items because of the noncash items included in the total price of the acquisition and the timing of certain cash payments the net cash paid may differ significantly

delaware basin for  million a majority of our  share of such amount is expected to be paid in common units issued to certain of the sellers at closing which we expect to occur subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions during the first half of        asset sales program  during  we initiated a program to evaluate potential sales of noncore assets andor sales of partial interests in assets to strategic joint venture partners to optimize our asset portfolio and strengthen our balance sheet and leverage metrics we completed approximately  million of asset sales in  net

conditions  capital projects   the majority of our  expansion capital program will be invested in our feebased transportation and facilities segments we expect that our investments will have minimal

distributions if the amount we distributed with respect to any quarter exceeded certain specified levels see note  to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of the prior quarterly incentive distribution provisions and amounts paid to our general partner in   and  we believe that we have sufficient liquid assets cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under our credit agreements to meet our financial commitments debt service obligations contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures we are however subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow a prolonged material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity contingencies for a discussion of contingencies that may impact us see note  to our consolidated financial statements commitments contractual obligations   in the ordinary course of doing business we purchase crude oil and ngl from third parties under contracts the majority of which range in term from thirtyday evergreen to five years with a limited number of contracts with remaining terms extending up to nine years we establish a margin for these purchases by entering into various types of physical and financial sale and exchange transactions through which we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases on the one hand and sales and future delivery obligations on the other in addition we enter into similar contractual obligations in conjunction with our natural gas operations the table below includes purchase obligations related to these activities where applicable the amounts presented represent the net obligations associated with our counterparties including giving effect to netting buysell contracts and those subject to a net settlement arrangement we do not expect to use a significant amount of internal capital to meet these obligations as the obligations will be funded by corresponding sales to entities that we deem creditworthy or who have provided credit support we consider adequate the following table includes our best estimate of the amount and timing of these

uncertainties involved in these estimates include levels of production at the wellhead weather conditions changes in market prices and other conditions beyond our control letters of credit   in connection with supply and logistics activities we provide certain suppliers with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase of crude oil ngl and natural gas our

qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks including i commodity price risk ii interest rate risk and iii currency exchange rate risk  we use various derivative instruments to manage such risks and in certain circumstances to realize incremental margin during volatile market conditions  our risk management policies and procedures are designed to help ensure that our hedging activities address our risks by monitoring our exchangecleared and overthecounter positions as well as physical volumes grades locations delivery schedules and storage capacity we have a risk management function that has direct responsibility and authority for our risk policies related controls around commercial activities and certain aspects of corporate risk management  our risk management function also approves all new risk management strategies through a formal process the following discussion addresses each category of risk commodity price risk we use derivative instruments to hedge price risk associated with the following commodities • crude oil we utilize crude oil derivatives to hedge commodity price risk inherent in our supply and logistics and transportation segments  our objectives for these derivatives include hedging anticipated purchases and sales stored inventory and storage capacity utilization  we manage these exposures with various instruments including exchangetraded and overthecounter futures forwards swaps and options • natural gas we utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge commodity price risk inherent in our supply and logistics and facilities segments  our objectives for these derivatives include hedging anticipated purchases and sales and managing our anticipated base gas requirements  we manage these exposures with various instruments including exchangetraded futures swaps and options • ngl and other we utilize ngl derivatives primarily butane and propane derivatives to hedge commodity price risk inherent in our supply and logistics segment our objectives for these derivatives include hedging anticipated purchases and sales and stored inventory  we manage these exposures with various instruments including exchangetraded and overthecounter futures forwards swaps and options see note  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our hedging strategies and objectives the fair value of our commodity derivatives and the change in fair value as of december   that would be expected from a  price increase or decrease is shown in the table below in millions   fair value   effect of  price increase   effect of  price decrease crude oil             natural gas           ngl and other            total fair value            the fair values presented in the table above reflect the sensitivity of the derivative instruments only and do not include the effect of the underlying hedged commodity  pricerisk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an acrosstheboard  increase or decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price  in the event of an actual  change in nearterm commodity prices the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table as changes in nearterm prices are not typically mirrored in delivery months further out  table of contents interest rate risk our use of variable rate debt and any forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt expose us to interest rate risk therefore from time to time we use interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate risk associated with anticipated interest payments and in certain cases outstanding debt instruments all of our senior notes are fixed rate notes and thus are not subject to interest rate risk our variable rate debt outstanding at december    approximately  billion  is subject to interest rate resets that range from less than one week to two months the average interest rate on variable rate debt that was outstanding during the year ended december   was  based upon rates in effect during the year the fair value of our interest rate derivatives was a liability of  million as of december    a  increase in the forward libor curve as of december   would have resulted in an increase of  million to the fair value of our interest rate derivatives a  decrease in the forward libor curve as of december   would have resulted in a decrease of  million to the fair value of our interest rate derivatives see note  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate risk hedging activities currency exchange rate risk we use foreign currency derivatives to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our exposure to fluctuations in the usdtocad exchange rate because a significant portion of our canadian business is conducted in cad and at times a portion of our debt is denominated in cad we use certain financial instruments to minimize the risks of unfavorable changes in exchange rates these instruments include foreign currency exchange contracts forwards and options the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives was a liability of  million as of december    a  increase in the exchange rate usdtocad would have resulted in a decrease of  million to the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives a  decrease in the exchange rate usdtocad would have resulted in an increase of  million to the fair value of our foreign currency derivatives see note  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our currency exchange rate risk hedging preferred distribution rate reset option   the preferred distribution rate reset option of our series a preferred units is an embedded derivative that must be bifurcated from the related host contract our partnership agreement and recorded at fair value in our condensed consolidated balance sheets the valuation model utilized for this embedded derivative contains inputs including our common unit price tenyear us treasury rates and default probabilities to ultimately calculate the fair value of our series a preferred units with and without the preferred distribution rate reset option the fair value of this embedded derivative was a liability of  million as of december    a  increase in the fair

currently serve on the compensation committee and served on the compensation committee throughout  during  none of the members of the compensation committee was an officer or employee of us or any of our subsidiaries or served as an officer of any company with respect to which any of our executive officers served on such company’s board of directors in addition none of the members of the compensation committee are former employees of ours or any of our subsidiaries mr petersen is associated with encap investments lp “encap” mr raymond is associated with emg and mr sinnott is associated with kayne anderson and its affiliates we have relationships with these entities see item  “certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—transactions with related persons” compensation discussion and analysis background all of our named executive officers are employed by gp llc under our partnership agreement we are required to reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all employmentrelated costs including compensation for our named executive officers for  we are including our ceo cfo and the three most highly compensated executive officers other than our ceo and cfo as well as an additional individual as a named executive officer defined in the summary compensation table below therefore as used throughout this compensation discussion and analysis the term named executive officers includes messrs armstrong pefanis chiang swanson mcgee and nerbonne objectives since our inception we have employed a compensation philosophy that emphasizes pay for performance both on an individual and entity level and places the majority of each named executive officer’s defined in the summary compensation table below compensation at risk the primary longterm measure of our performance is our ability to sustain and increase our quarterly distribution to our unitholders however we also use other measures such as the amount of distributable cash flow we generate over a specified period of time we believe our payforperformance approach aligns the interests of our executive officers with that of our equity holders and at the same time enables us to maintain a lower level of base overhead in the event our operating and financial performance is below expectations our executive compensation is designed to attract and retain individuals with the background and skills necessary to successfully execute our business model in a demanding environment to motivate those individuals to reach nearterm and longterm goals in a way that aligns their interest with that of our unitholders and to reward success in reaching such goals we use three primary elements of compensation to fulfill that design—salary cash bonus and longterm equity incentive awards cash bonuses and equity incentives as opposed to salary  table of contents represent the performance driven elements they are also flexible in application and can be tailored to meet our objectives the determination of specific individuals’ cash bonuses is based on their relative contribution to achieving or exceeding annual goals andor performance against opportunity and the determination of specific individuals’ longterm incentive awards is based on their expected contribution in respect of longer term performance objectives we do not maintain a defined benefit or pension plan for our executive officers as we believe such plans primarily reward longevity and not performance we provide a basic benefits package generally to all employees which includes a k plan and health disability and life insurance in instances considered necessary for the execution of their job responsibilities we also reimburse certain of our named executive officers and other employees for club dues and similar expenses we consider these benefits and reimbursements to be typical of other employers and we do not believe they are distinctive of our compensation program elements of compensation salary we do not “benchmark” our salary or bonus amounts in practice we believe our salaries are generally competitive with the narrower universe of largecap master limited partnerships but are moderate relative to the broad spectrum of energy industry competitors for similar talent cash bonuses our cash bonuses include annual discretionary bonuses in which all of our named executive officers potentially participate longterm incentive awards the primary longterm measure of our performance is our ability to sustain and increase our quarterly distribution to our unitholders however we also use other measures such as the amount of distributable cash flow we generate over a specified period of time historically we have generally used performanceindexed phantom unit grants issued under our longterm incentive plans to encourage and reward timely achievement of targeted distribution levels and align the longterm interests of our named executive officers with those of our unitholders these grants require minimum service periods as further described below in order to encourage longterm retention a phantom unit is the right to receive upon the satisfaction of vesting criteria specified in the grant a common unit or cash equivalent we do not use options as a form of incentive compensation unlike “vesting” of an option vesting of a phantom unit results in delivery of a common unit or cash of equivalent value as opposed to a right to exercise terms of historical phantom unit grants have varied but generally phantom units vest upon the later of achievement of targeted distribution threshold levels and continued employment for periods ranging from two to five years these distribution performance thresholds are generally consistent with our targeted range for distribution growth to encourage accelerated performance if we meet certain distribution or other performance thresholds prior to meeting the minimum service requirement for vesting our current named executive officers have the right to receive distributions on phantom units prior to vesting in the underlying common units referred to as distribution equivalent rights or “ders” in  the owners of aap authorized the creation of class b units of aap “aap management units” each of which represents a profits interest in aap and authorized the compensation committee to issue grants of aap management units to create additional longterm incentives for our management designed to attract talent and encourage retention over an extended period of time the aap management units are subject to restrictions on transfer and generally become incrementally “earned” entitled to receive a portion of the distributions that would otherwise be paid to holders of aap units upon achievement of certain performance thresholds related to achievement of targeted distribution levels andor targeted distributable cash flow levels which are aligned with the interests of our common unitholders as of february    of the outstanding aap management units granted in    and  including those held by mr mcgee had been earned  of the aap management units granted in  including a portion held by mr mcgee had been earned and  of the aap management units granted in  had been earned none of the aap management units issued in  including those held by messrs chiang and nerbonne have been earned no aap management units were granted in   or  to encourage retention following achievement of the applicable performance benchmarks aap retained a call right to purchase any earned aap management units at a discount to fair market value that is generally exercisable upon the termination of a holder’s employment with gp llc and its affiliates other than termination under certain circumstances such as a termination without cause or by the employee for good reason prior to certain stated dates if a holder of an aap management unit remains employed past such designated date or prior to such date such holder is terminated without cause or quits for good reason any earned units are no longer subject to the call right and are deemed to have “vested”  as of january   aap management units granted in   and  including those held by messrs armstrong pefanis and swanson were no longer subject to such call right and have vested a significant portion of the vested aap management units including all or a portion of those held by messrs armstrong pefanis and swanson have been converted as described  table of contents below and are no longer outstanding the applicable vesting dates for the remaining aap management unit grants range from january   for aap management units granted in  to january   for aap management units granted in  the size of the discount to fair market value reflected in the potential call right purchase price decreases over time pursuant to a formula set forth in each aap management unit grant agreement aap management unit grants also provide that all earned aap management units and a portion of any unearned and unvested aap management units will vest upon a change of control all earned aap management units will also vest if aap does not timely exercise its call right as long as the pagp class a shares are publicly traded each vested aap management unit may be converted into aap units and a like number of pagp class b shares based on a conversion ratio of approximately  following any such conversion the resulting aap units and pagp class b shares are exchangeable for pagp class a shares or subject to certain limitations redeemable for paa common units in each case on a oneforone basis as provided in the aap limited partnership agreement between january   and february   approximately  million aap management units became vested of which  million were converted into  million aap units and pagp class b shares and  million were converted and then exchanged for an aggregate of  million pagp class a shares see item  “certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—our general partner—aap management units” prior to the simplification transactions the entire economic burden of the aap management units was borne by aap however in connection with the closing of the simplification transactions aap received one paa common unit for each outstanding earned and vested aap management unit and paa withheld approximately  units from the simplification consideration for future distribution or issuance when and if such units become earned relation of compensation elements to compensation objectives our compensation program is designed to motivate reward and retain our executive officers cash bonuses serve as a nearterm motivation and reward for achieving the annual goals established at the beginning of each year phantom unit awards and associated ders and aap management units provide motivation and reward over both the nearterm and longterm for achieving performance thresholds necessary for earning and vesting the level of annual bonus and phantom unit awards reflect the moderate salary profile and the significant weighting towards performance based atrisk compensation salaries and cash bonuses  as well as currently payable ders associated with unvested phantom units and earned aap management units subject to aap’s call right serve as nearterm retention tools longerterm retention is facilitated by the minimum service periods of up to five years associated with phantom unit awards the longterm vesting profile of the aap management units and in the case of certain executives directly involved in activities that generate partnership earnings annual bonuses that are payable over a threeyear period to facilitate the compensation committee in reviewing and making recommendations a compensation “tally sheet” is prepared by the ceo and general counsel and provided to the compensation committee we stress performancebased compensation elements to attempt to create a performancedriven environment in which our executive officers are i motivated to perform over both the short term and the long term ii appropriately rewarded for their services and iii encouraged to remain with us even after meeting longterm performance thresholds in order to meet the minimum service periods and by the potential for rewards yet to come we believe our compensation philosophy as implemented by application of the three primary compensation elements i aligns the interests of our named executive officers with our unitholders ii positions us to achieve our business goals and iii effectively encourages the exercise of sound judgment and risktaking that is conducive to creating and sustaining longterm value we believe the processes employed by the compensation committee and by the board in applying the elements of compensation as discussed in more detail below provide an adequate level of oversight with respect to the degree of risk being taken by management to achieve shortterm performance goals see “relation of compensation policies and practices to risk management” we believe our compensation program has been instrumental in our achievement of stated objectives over the fiveyear period ended december   our annual distribution per common unit has grown at a compound annual rate of  and the total return realized by our unitholders for that period averaged approximately  per annum as compared to the amz total return of  during this period we have enjoyed a very high rate of retention among executive officers application of compensation elements salary   we do not make systematic annual adjustments to the salaries of our named executive officers we do however make salary adjustments as necessary to maintain hierarchical relationships among senior management levels after new senior management members are added to keep pace with our overall growth since the date of our initial public offering in  or date of employment if later through december   messrs armstrong and pefanis have each received one salary adjustment and mr swanson mr mcgee and mr nerbonne have received four one and two salary adjustments  table of contents respectively in connection with taking on increasing responsibilities and promotions during  and  mr armstrong unilaterally elected to forego approximately  of his annual base salary annual discretionary bonuses   annual discretionary bonuses are determined based on our performance relative to our annual plan forecast and public guidance typically provided quarterly in conjunction with release of earnings our distribution growth targets and other quantitative and qualitative goals established at the beginning of each year such annual objectives are discussed and reviewed with the board of directors in conjunction with the review and authorization of the annual plan at the end of each year the ceo performs a quantitative and qualitative assessment of our performance relative to our goals key quantitative measures include earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization including our proportionate share of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated entities and adjusted for certain selected items impacting comparability “adjusted ebitda” relative to established guidance as well as the growth in the annualized quarterly distribution level per common unit relative to annual growth targets our primary performance metric is our ability to sustain and increase cash distributions to our unitholders we also use distributable cash flow as a performance metric accordingly although net income and net income per common unit are monitored to highlight inconsistencies with primary performance metrics as is our market performance relative to our mlp peers and major indices these metrics are considered secondary performance measures the ceo’s written analysis of our performance examines our accomplishments shortfalls and overall performance against opportunity taking into account controllable and noncontrollable factors encountered during the year the resulting document and supporting detail is submitted to the board of directors for review and comment based on the conclusions set forth in the annual performance review the ceo submits recommendations to the compensation committee for bonuses to our other named executive officers taking into account the relative contribution of the individual officer there are no set formulas for determining the annual discretionary bonus for our named executive officers however pursuant to his employment agreement mr chiang is entitled to a minimum bonus of  million for each of  and  factors considered by the ceo in determining the level of bonus in general include i whether or not we achieved the goals established for the year and any notable shortfalls relative to expectations ii the level of difficulty associated with achieving such objectives based on the opportunities and challenges encountered during the year iii current year operating and financial performance relative to both public guidance and prior year’s performance iv significant transactions or accomplishments for the period not included in the goals for the year v our relative prospects at the end of the year with respect to future growth and performance and vi our positioning at the end of the year with respect to our targeted credit profile the ceo takes these factors into consideration as well as the relative contributions of each of our named executive officers to the year’s performance in developing his recommendations for bonus amounts these recommendations are discussed with the compensation committee adjusted as appropriate and submitted to the board of directors for its review and approval similarly the compensation committee typically assesses the ceo’s contribution toward meeting our goals and recommends a bonus for the ceo it believes to be commensurate with such contribution in several historical instances the ceo and the president have requested that the bonus amount recommended by the compensation committee be reduced to maintain a closer relationship to bonuses awarded to the other named executive officers with respect to  despite executing a number of positive transactions in a difficult environment and several positive qualitative accomplishments in consideration of weaker than expected financial and operating performance for  and challenging industry conditions each of the named executive officers indicated that they will neither request nor accept a cash bonus for  accordingly the typical practice of having the ceo submit to the compensation committee a preliminary draft of bonus recommendations was modified for  and the ceo did not recommend any cash bonuses for our named executive officers for  longterm incentive awards   we do not make systematic annual grants of phantom unit awards to our named executive officers although we may make “off cycle” awards from time to time generally our objective is to time the granting of awards such that the creation of new longterm incentives coincides with the satisfaction of performance thresholds under existing awards thus performance is rewarded by relatively greater frequency of awards and lack of performance by relatively lesser frequency of awards generally we believe that a grant cycle of approximately three years and extended timevesting requirements provides a balance between a meaningful retention period for us and a visible reachable reward for the executive officer achievement of performance targets does not shorten the minimum service period requirement if top performance targets on outstanding awards are achieved in the early part of this cycle new awards are granted with higher performance thresholds and the minimum service periods of the new awards are generally synchronized with the remaining timevesting requirements of outstanding awards in a manner designed to encourage extended retention of our named executive officers accordingly these new arrangements inherently take into account the value of awards where performance levels have been achieved but have not yet vested due to ongoing service period requirements but do not take into consideration previous awards that have fully vested  table of contents aap management units each of which represents a “profits interest” in aap have been previously issued to provide an additional longerterm performancebased officer incentive as of december    aap management units were held by our named executive officers the compensation committee does not plan to issue any additional aap management units   application in  at the beginning of  we established internal quantitative and qualitative goals that included implementing strategic plan initiatives advancing multiyear programs and initiatives to prepare the organization for future growth and enhancing and improving our focus on safe compliant and reliable operations such goals were generally consistent with or overlapped our publicly stated objectives to  maintain a solid balance sheet sound credit metrics and ample liquidity  execute our capital program in order to facilitate cash flow growth underpinned by mvcs and position paa to benefit meaningfully as us production volumes increase and  optimize our assets and focus our organization to deliver the best results possible under whatever conditions we encounter in the near term  was a challenging year for the energy industry in general and paa specifically as industry sentiments and overall activity levels generally followed oil price movements throughout  accordingly the overall environment for the crude oil and mlp sectors was extremely unfavorable for the first six months of  recovered some over the next five months and then strengthened in relative terms throughout december in response to positive opec actions in response to the drop in oil prices and severely limited capital market access oil producers revised down their  capital budgets relative to prior indications and the lower  onshore oil rig count declined approximately  from year end  levels of around  rigs to bottom at approximately  rigs in may  the reduced activity level adversely impacted expected crude oil production levels which in conjunction with pressures associated with mvc overcommitments intensified competition for the marginal barrel for gathering marketing and transport and exacerbated the already severe pressure on margins paa’s operating and financial results in  came in below public guidance despite aggressive steps to compete in the highly competitive environment however paa accomplished a number of positive events that included raising capital in a challenging environment orchestrating a complex simplification transaction and executing a number of transactions that reduced risk and lowered leverage paa also executed its expansion capital program on time and on budget and advanced a number of multiyear efforts to improve our efficiency lower operating costs and enhance our focus on safe compliant and reliable operations selected actionstransactions included • raising  billion of common and preferred equity on terms considered by us to be fair and reasonable during challenging and volatile market conditions • completing a complex simplification transaction that significantly reduced paa’s cost of equity capital and enhanced its ability to fund its activities • executing a  billion capital expansion program generally on time and on budget • initiating and completing approximately  million of asset sales at attractive multiples and advancing discussions on an additional  million of asset sales transactions that are now fully contracted and expected to close during the first half of  • entering into various joint venture transactions that reduced risk and the level of paa’s capital commitments • initiating a review to challenge and reduce operating costs to adapt and strengthen paa’s organization for the future and • executing a strategic ngl acquisition for approximately  million and positioning paa to complete the acquisition of a strategic crude oil gathering system in the northern delaware basin in early  for approximately  billion for  the elements of compensation were applied as described below

promotion to executive vice president no salary adjustments for named executive officers were recommended or made in   see “—employment contracts” for additional information regarding the base salaries of our named executive officers with employment contracts cash bonuses   given the weaker than expected financial and operating performance for  and challenging industry conditions each of

awards   except as provided by applicable laws and regulations we do not have a policy with respect to adjustment or recovery of awards or payments if relevant company performance measures upon which previous awards were based are restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would have reduced the size of such award or payment if previously known section m   with respect to the deduction limitations under section m of the code we are a limited partnership and do not fall within the definition of a “corporation” under section m change in control triggers   the employment agreements for messrs armstrong pefanis and chiang the longterm incentive plan grants to our named executive officers and the aap management unit grant agreements to which our named executive officers are a party include severance payment provisions or accelerated vesting triggered upon a change of control as defined in the respective agreements in the case of the longterm incentive plan grants the provision becomes operative only if the change in control is accompanied by a change in status such as the termination of employment by gp llc we believe this “double trigger” arrangement is appropriate because it provides assurance to the executive but does not offer a windfall to the executive when there has been no real change in employment status the provisions in the employment agreements for messrs armstrong and pefanis become operative only if the executive terminates employment within three months of the change in control messrs armstrong and pefanis agreed to a conditional waiver of these provisions with respect to all prior qualifying transactions  mr chiang’s employment agreement provides for accelerated vesting of his  longterm incentive plan grant and aap management unit grant in the event of a change of control prior to december   if in connection therewith he is not designated to receive a promotion to the top leadership position of gp llc and terminates his employment within a period of  days following such change of control see “—employment contracts” and “—potential payments upon termination or changeincontrol” the provision of severance or equity acceleration for certain terminations and change of control help to create a retention tool by assuring the executive that the benefit of the employment arrangement will be at least partially realized despite the occurrence of an event that would materially alter the employment arrangement relation of compensation policies and practices to risk management our compensation policies and practices are designed to provide rewards for shortterm and longterm performance both on an individual basis and at the entity level in general optimal financial and operational performance particularly in a competitive business requires some degree of risktaking accordingly the use of compensation as an incentive for performance can foster the potential for management and others to take unnecessary or excessive risks to reach the performance thresholds  for us such risks would primarily attach to certain commercial activities conducted in our supply and logistics segment as well as to the execution of capital expansion projects and acquisitions and the realization of associated returns  table of contents from a risk management perspective our policy is to conduct our commercial activities within predefined risk parameters that are closely monitored and are structured in a manner intended to control and minimize the potential for unwarranted risktaking  see “impact of commodity price volatility and dynamic market conditions on our business model—risk management” in part i of this annual report  we also routinely monitor and measure the execution and performance of our capital projects and acquisitions relative to expectations our compensation arrangements contain a number of design elements that serve to minimize the incentive for unwarranted risktaking to achieve shortterm unsustainable results including splitting the awards into a number of tranches and delaying the vesting date for various tranches in addition to subjecting such awards to forfeiture for terminations related to violations of our risk management policies and practices or of our code of business conduct  in addition the vesting criteria for our longterm incentive awards are typically based on the passage of time andor the payment of distributions from currently available cash  see “compensation discussion and analysis—relation of compensation elements to compensation objectives” in combination with our riskmanagement practices we do not believe that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us summary compensation table the following table sets forth certain compensation information for our chief executive officer chief financial officer president and chief operating officer

incentive distribution rights “idrs” in us if the amount we distributed with respect to any quarter exceeded certain specified levels under the quarterly distribution provisions in our partnership agreement in effect prior to the simplification transactions our general partner was generally entitled without duplication and except for the agreed upon adjustments discussed below to  of amounts we distributed up to   annualized per common unit  of amounts we distributed in excess of   annualized per common unit  of the amounts we distributed in excess of   annualized per common unit and  of

vesting or exercise as applicable of such awards our board of directors has the right to alter or amend the plans from time to time including subject to any applicable nyse listing requirements increasing the number of common units with respect to which awards may be granted provided however that no change in any outstanding grant may be made that would materially impair the rights of the participant without the consent of such participant common units to be delivered upon the vesting of rights may be common units acquired in the open market or common units acquired from us any of our affiliates or any other person or any combination of the foregoing our general partner will be entitled to reimbursement by us for the cost incurred in acquiring common units in addition over the term

phantom units   a phantom unit entitles the grantee to receive upon the vesting of the phantom unit a common unit or cash equivalent depending on the terms of the grant  the issuance of the common units upon vesting of phantom units is primarily intended to serve as a means of incentive compensation for performance therefore no consideration is paid to us by the plan participants upon receipt of the common units as of december   grants of approximately  and  unvested phantom units were outstanding under the  plan and png successor plan respectively and approximately  and  remained available for future grant respectively the compensation committee or board of directors may in the future make additional grants under the plans to employees and directors containing such terms as the compensation committee or board of directors shall determine including ders with respect to phantom units ders entitle the grantee to a cash payment either while the award is outstanding or upon vesting equal to any cash distributions paid on a unit while the award is outstanding unit appreciation rights  a unit appreciation right is an award that upon exercise entitles the holder to receive the excess if any of the fair market value of a common unit on the exercise date over the grant price of the unit appreciation right  the excess may be paid in cash andor common units as determined by the plan administrator in its discretion  no unit appreciation rights have been granted under the plans to date restricted unit awards  a restricted unit is a common unit granted under the plan that

entitles the holder to participate in future profits and losses from operations current distributions from operations and an interest in future appreciation or depreciation in aap’s asset values as of december    aap management units were issued and outstanding  the compensation committee does not plan to issue any additional aap management units the outstanding aap management units are subject to restrictions on transfer and generally become “earned” entitled to receive a portion of the distributions that would otherwise be paid to holders of aap units in percentage increments when certain performance thresholds related to achievement of targeted distribution levels andor targeted distributable cash flow levels are achieved  as of february   approximately  of the outstanding aap management units had been earned  the remaining aap management units will be earned upon achievement of certain distribution and distributable cash flow levels to encourage retention following achievement of the applicable performance benchmarks aap retained a call right to purchase any earned aap management units at a discount to fair market value that is generally exercisable upon the termination of a holder’s employment with gp llc and its affiliates other than termination under certain circumstances such as a termination without cause or by the employee for good reason prior to certain stated dates  if a holder of an aap management unit remains employed past such designated date or prior to such date such holder is terminated without cause or quits for good reason any earned units are no longer subject to the call right and are deemed to have “vested”  as of  table of contents january   aap management units granted in   and  are no longer subject to such call right and have vested the applicable vesting dates for the remaining aap management unit grants range from january   for aap management units granted in  to january   for aap management units granted in  the size of the discount to fair market value reflected in the potential call right purchase price decreases over time pursuant to a formula set forth in each aap management unit grant agreement  aap management unit grants also provide that all earned aap management units and a portion of any unearned and unvested aap management units will vest upon a change of control all earned aap management units will also vest if aap does not timely exercise its call right as long as the pagp class a shares are publicly traded each vested aap management unit may be converted into aap units and a like number of pagp class b shares based on a conversion ratio of approximately  aap units and pagp class b shares for each aap management unit  following any such conversion the resulting aap units and pagp class b shares are exchangeable for pagp class a shares or subject to certain limitations redeemable for paa common units in each case on a oneforone basis as provided in the aap limited partnership agreement between january   and february   approximately  million aap management units became vested of which  million were converted into  million aap units and pagp class b shares and  million were converted and then exchanged for an aggregate of  million pagp class a shares as of february   none of the converted aap management units had been redeemed for paa common units prior to the simplification transactions the entire economic burden of the aap management units was borne by aap however in connection with the closing of the simplification transactions aap received one paa common unit for each outstanding earned and vested aap management unit and paa withheld approximately  units from the simplification consideration for future distribution or issuance when and if such units become earned administrative agreement in connection with the closing of the initial public offering of pagp in  paa entered into an administrative agreement the “administrative agreement” with pagp pagp gp aap paa gp llc and gp llc to address among other things potential conflicts with respect to business opportunities that may arise among pagp pagp gp aap paa paa gp llc and gp llc the agreement provides that if any business opportunity is presented to pagp pagp gp aap paa paa gp llc or gp llc then paa will have the first right to pursue such business opportunity pagp will have the

execution by aap of a reverse split to adjust the number of aap units such that the number of outstanding aap units assuming the conversion of aap management units into aap units equaled the number of our common units received by aap at the closing of the simplification transactions simultaneously pagp executed a reverse split to adjust the number of pagp class a and class b shares outstanding to equal the number of aap units it owns following aap’s reverse unit split these reverse splits along with the omnibus agreement described below resulted in economic alignment between our common unitholders and pagp’s class a shareholders such that the number of outstanding pagp class a shares equals the number of aap units owned by pagp which in turn equals the number of our common units held by aap we also entered into an omnibus agreement with the pagp entities pursuant to which such onetoone relationship will be maintained subsequent to the closing of the simplification

obligation of pagp to use the net proceeds therefrom to purchase a like number of aap units from aap and the corresponding obligation of aap to use the net proceeds therefrom to purchase a like number of paa common units from paa and • the ability of pagp to lend proceeds of any future indebtedness incurred by it to aap and aap’s corresponding obligation to lend such proceeds to paa in each case on substantially the same terms as incurred by pagp also clarifying that paa will reimburse the net fees and expenses in connection with the incurrence of such debt provided that paa will only be required to reimburse such net fees and expenses on one occasion with respect to each incurrence of indebtedness by paa from aap aap credit agreement in connection with the simplification transactions

american pipeline lp’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control—integrated framework”  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” to evaluate the effectiveness of the partnership’s internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation management has concluded that the partnership’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december    the

presentation our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate s pricewaterhousecoopers llp houston

things • the permanent elimination of our incentive distribution rights “idrs” and the economic rights associated with our  general partner interest in exchange for the issuance by us to aap of  million paa common units including approximately  million units to be issued in the future and the assumption by us of all of aap’s outstanding debt   million  • the implementation of a unified

applicable f table of contents note  —summary of significant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we make significant estimates with respect to i estimated fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and identification of associated goodwill and intangible assets ii fair value of derivatives iii accruals and contingent liabilities iv equityindexed compensation plan accruals v property and equipment depreciation expense and asset retirement obligations vi allowance for doubtful accounts and vii inventory valuations although we believe these estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates revenue recognition supply and logistics segment revenues   revenues from sales of crude oil ngl and natural gas are recognized at the time title to the product sold transfers to the purchaser which occurs upon delivery of the product to the purchaser or its designee sales of crude oil and ngl consist of outright sales contracts inventory purchases and sales under buysell transactions are treated as inventory exchanges the sales under these exchanges are netted to zero in supply and logistics segment revenues in our consolidated statements of operations additionally we may utilize derivatives in connection with the transactions described above for commodity derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges derivative gains and losses are deferred in aoci and recognized in revenues in the periods during which the underlying physical hedged transaction impacts earnings also the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of cash flow hedges is recognized in revenues each period along with the change in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for or are not designated for hedge accounting transportation segment revenues   our transportation segment operations generally consist of feebased activities associated with transporting crude oil and ngl on pipelines gathering systems trucks and barges revenues from pipeline tariffs and fees are associated with the transportation of crude oil and ngl at a published tariff as well as revenues associated with agreements for committed space on various assets tariff revenues are recognized either at the point of delivery or at the point of receipt pursuant to specifications outlined in the tariffs revenues associated with fees are recognized in the month to which the fee applies as is common in the pipeline transportation industry our tariffs incorporate a loss allowance factor that is intended to offset losses due to evaporation measurement and other losses in transit we value the variance of allowance volumes to actual losses at the estimated net realizable value including the impact of gains and losses from derivative related activities at the time the variance occurred and the result is recorded as either an increase or decrease to tariff revenues facilities segment revenues   our facilities segment operations generally consist of feebased activities associated with providing storage terminalling and throughput services for crude oil refined products ngl and natural gas as well as ngl fractionation and isomerization services and natural gas and condensate processing services revenues generated in this segment include i fees that are generated from storage capacity agreements ii terminal throughput fees that are generated when we receive crude oil refined products or ngl from one connecting source and deliver the applicable product to another connecting carrier iii  loading and unloading fees at our rail terminals iv fees from ngl fractionation and isomerization v fees from natural gas and condensate processing services and vi fees associated with natural gas park and loan activities interruptible storage services and wheeling and balancing services we generate revenue through a combination of monthtomonth and multiyear agreements storage fees resulting from shortterm and longterm contracts are typically recognized in revenue ratably over the term of the contract regardless of the actual storage capacity utilized terminal fees including throughput and rail fees are recognized as the crude oil ngl or refined product enters or exits the terminal and is received from or delivered to the connecting carrier or thirdparty terminal as applicable hub service fees are recognized in the period the natural gas moves across our header system fees from ngl fractionation isomerization services and gas processing services are recognized in the period when the services are performed minimum volume commitments  we have certain agreements that require counterparties to deliver transport or throughput a minimum volume over an agreed upon period  some of these agreements include makeup rights if the minimum volume is not met we record a receivable from the counterparty in the period that services are provided or when the transaction occurs including amounts for deficiency obligations from counterparties associated with minimum volume commitments  if a counterparty has a makeup right associated with a deficiency we defer the revenue attributable to the counterparty makeup right and subsequently recognize the revenue at the earlier of when the deficiency volume is delivered or shipped when the makeup right expires or when it is determined that the counterparty’s ability to utilize the makeup right is remote f table of contents at december   and   counterparty deficiencies associated with agreements that include minimum volume commitments totaled  million and  million  respectively of which  million and  million  respectively was recorded as deferred revenue the balance of  million and  million at each respective date was related to deficiencies for which the counterparties had not met their contractual minimum commitments and were not reflected in our consolidated financial statements as we had not yet billed or collected such amounts purchases and related costs purchases and related costs include i the cost of crude oil ngl and natural gas obtained in outright purchases ii fees incurred for thirdparty storage and transportation whether by pipeline truck rail ship or barge and iii performancerelated bonus costs these costs are recognized when incurred except in the case of products purchased which are recognized at the time title transfers to us purchases that are part of inventory exchanges under buysell transactions are netted with the related sales with any margin presented in “purchases and related costs” in our consolidated statements of operations field operating costs and general and administrative expenses field operating costs consist of various field operating expenses including fuel and power costs including the impact of gains and losses from derivative related activities telecommunications payroll and benefit costs including equityindexed compensation expense for truck drivers and field and other operations personnel thirdparty trucking transportation costs for our us crude oil operations maintenance and integrity management costs regulatory compliance environmental remediation insurance vehicle leases and property taxes general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefit costs including equityindexed compensation expense certain information systems and legal costs office rent contract and consultant costs and audit and tax fees foreign currency transactionstranslation certain of our subsidiaries use the canadian dollar as their functional currency assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a canadian dollar functional currency are translated at periodend rates of exchange and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing for each month the resulting translation adjustments are made directly to a separate component of other comprehensive income which is reflected in partners’ capital on our consolidated balance sheets certain of our subsidiaries also enter into transactions and have monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the entities’ respective functional currencies gains and losses from the revaluation of foreign currency transactions and monetary assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated statements of operations the revaluation of foreign currency transactions and monetary assets and liabilities resulted in a net loss of  million for the year ended december    a net gain of  million for the year ended december   and a net loss of  million for the year ended december    cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of all unrestricted demand deposits and funds invested in highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less and typically exceed federally insured limits we periodically assess the financial condition of the institutions where these funds are held and believe that our credit risk is minimal in accordance with our policy outstanding checks are classified as accounts payable rather than negative cash as of december   and   accounts payable included  million and  million  respectively of outstanding checks that were reclassified from cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable net our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers and shippers of crude oil and to a lesser extent purchasers of ngl and natural gas these purchasers include but are not limited to refiners producers marketing and trading companies and financial institutions that are active in the physical and financial commodity markets the majority of our accounts receivable relate to our crude oil supply and logistics activities that can generally be described as high volume and low margin activities in many cases involving exchanges of crude oil volumes f table of contents the sustained decrease in commodity prices since late  has caused liquidity issues throughout the energy industry which in turn has increased the potential credit risks associated with certain counterparties with which we do business to mitigate credit risk related to our accounts receivable we utilize a rigorous credit review process we closely monitor market conditions to make a determination with respect to the amount if any of open credit to be extended to any given customer and the form and amount of financial performance assurances we require such financial assurances are commonly provided to us in the form of advance cash payments standby letters of credit or parental guarantees as of december   and   we had received  million and  million  respectively of advance cash payments from third parties to mitigate credit risk we also received  million and  million as of december   and   respectively of standby letters of credit to support obligations due from third parties a portion of which applies to future business additionally in an effort to mitigate credit risk a significant portion of our transactions with counterparties are settled on a netcash basis furthermore we also enter into netting agreements contractual agreements that allow us to offset receivables and payables with those counterparties against each other on our balance sheet for a majority of such arrangements we review all outstanding accounts receivable balances on a monthly basis and record a reserve for amounts that we expect will not be fully recovered we do not apply actual balances against the reserve until we have exhausted substantially all collection efforts at december   and   substantially all of our trade accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts were less than  days past their scheduled invoice date our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable totaled  million and  million at december   and   respectively although we consider our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable to be adequate actual amounts could vary significantly from estimated amounts noncontrolling interests we account for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries in accordance with fasb guidance which requires all entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements noncontrolling interest represents the portion of assets and liabilities in a consolidated subsidiary that is owned by a thirdparty  see note  for additional discussion regarding our noncontrolling interests asset retirement obligations fasb guidance establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible longlived assets including estimates related to i the time of the liability recognition ii initial measurement of the liability iii allocation of asset retirement cost to expense iv subsequent measurement of the liability and v financial statement disclosures fasb guidance also requires that the cost for asset retirement should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related longlived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method some of our assets primarily related to our transportation and facilities segments have contractual or regulatory obligations to perform remediation and in some instances dismantlement and removal activities when the assets are abandoned these obligations include varying levels of activity including disconnecting inactive assets from active assets cleaning and purging assets and in some cases completely removing the assets and returning the land to its original state these assets have been in existence for many years and with regular maintenance will continue to be in service for many years to come it is not possible to predict when demand for these transportation or storage services will cease and we do not believe that such demand will cease for the foreseeable future accordingly we believe the date when these assets will be abandoned is indeterminate with no reasonably determinable abandonment date we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the associated asset retirement obligations we will record asset retirement obligations for these assets in the period in which sufficient information becomes available for us to reasonably determine the settlement dates a small portion of our contractual or regulatory obligations is related to assets that are inactive or that we plan to take out of service and although the ultimate timing and costs to settle these obligations are not known with certainty we have recorded a reasonable estimate of these obligations we have estimated that the fair value of these obligations was  million and  million  respectively at december   and   fair value measurements financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment which affects the placement of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels the determination of the fair values includes not only the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements such as cash deposits and letters of credit but also the impact of our nonperformance risk on our liabilities the fair value of our commodity derivatives interest rate derivatives and foreign currency derivatives includes adjustments for credit risk our credit adjustment methodology uses market observable inputs and requires judgment there were no changes to any of our valuation techniques during the period see note  for further

guidance is effective for the annual period ending after december   and for interim and annual periods thereafter we adopted this guidance for the  annual reporting period our adoption has not had any impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in may  the fasb issued guidance regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers with the underlying principle that an entity will recognize revenue to reflect amounts expected to be received in exchange for the provision of goods and services to customers upon the transfer of those goods or services the guidance also requires additional disclosures about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and the related cash flows this guidance can be adopted either with a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach with a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   we implemented a process to evaluate the impact of adopting this guidance on each type of revenue contract entered into with customers and our implementation team is in the process of determining appropriate changes to our business processes systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard in addition while we have not identified any significant revenue recognition timing differences for types of revenue streams assessed to date our evaluation is not complete and we have not quantified the impact to our financial statements including assessing the impact of changes to disclosures we expect this determination will near completion during the first half of  we will adopt this guidance on january   and are currently evaluating which transition approach to apply f table of contents note  —net income per common unit after consideration of distributions to preferred unitholders whether cash or paidinkind basic and diluted net income per common unit is determined pursuant to the twoclass method as prescribed in fasb guidance this method is an earnings allocation formula that is used to determine allocations to the general partner limited partners and participating securities according to distributions pertaining to the current period’s net income and participation rights in undistributed earnings or distributions in excess of earnings under the twoclass method net income is reduced by distributions pertaining to the period and all remaining earnings or distributions in excess of earnings are then allocated to our general partner common unitholders and participating securities based on their respective rights to share in distributions regardless of whether those earnings would actually be distributed during a particular period from an economic or practical perspective participating securities include ltip awards that have vested ders which entitle the grantee to a cash payment equal to the cash distribution paid on our outstanding common units the simplification transactions which closed on november   included the permanent elimination of our idrs and the economic rights associated with our  general partner interest in exchange for the issuance by us to aap of approximately  million common units and the assumption by us of aap’s debt in addition we will issue to aap up to  million common units in connection with certain aap management units becoming earned in future periods as such beginning with the distribution pertaining to the fourth quarter of  our general partner is no longer entitled to receive distributions on the idrs or general partner interest see note  for additional discussion of the simplification transactions we calculate basic and diluted net income per common unit by dividing net income attributable to paa after deducting amounts allocated to the preferred unitholders and participating securities and for applicable periods the  general partner’s interest and idrs by the basic and diluted weightedaverage number of common units outstanding during the period diluted net income per common unit is computed based on the weightedaverage number of common units plus the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period which include i our series a preferred units ii our ltip awards and iii units that are issuable to aap when certain aap management units are earned see note  for additional information regarding our series a preferred units see note  for a complete discussion of our ltip awards including specific discussion regarding ders and the aap management units when applying the ifconverted method prescribed by fasb guidance the possible conversion of our series a preferred units was excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per common unit for the year ended december   as the effect was antidilutive our ltip awards and certain aap management units that contemplate the issuance of common units are considered dilutive unless i vesting occurs only upon the satisfaction of a performance condition and ii that performance condition has yet to be satisfied ltip awards that were deemed to be dilutive for the periods presented were reduced by a hypothetical common unit repurchase based on the remaining unamortized fair value as prescribed by the treasury stock method in guidance issued by the fasb as none of the necessary conditions for the remaining aap management units to become earned had been satisfied by december   no units issuable to aap were contemplated in the calculation of diluted

policy for the recognition of asset impairments impairment of longlived assets longlived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through future cash flows are written down to estimated fair value in accordance with fasb guidance with respect to the accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets under this guidance a longlived asset is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset is recognized we periodically evaluate property and equipment and other longlived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions of related cash flows the subjective assumptions used to determine the existence of an impairment in carrying value include • whether there is an indication of impairment • the grouping of assets • the intention of “holding” “abandoning” or “selling” an asset • the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset’s estimated useful life and • if an impairment exists the fair value of the asset or asset group f table of contents during the year ended december   we recognized  million of noncash impairment losses on certain of our longlived rail and other terminal assets included in our facilities segment such impairment losses are reflected in “depreciation and amortization” on our consolidated financial statements the decline in demand for movements of crude oil by rail in the united states due to sustained unfavorable market conditions resulted in expected decreases in future cash flows for certain of our rail terminal assets which was a triggering event that required us to assess the recoverability of our carrying value of such longlived assets as a result of this impairment review we wrote off the portion of the carrying amount of these longlived assets that exceeded their fair value our estimated fair values were based upon recent sales prices of comparable facilities as well as management’s expectation of the market values for such assets based on their industry experience we consider such inputs to be a level  input in the fair value hierarchy we did no t recognize any impairments during the year ended december   during the year ended december   we recognized impairments of  million primarily related to assets that were taken out of service note  —acquisitions and dispositions the following acquisitions excluding acquired interests accounted for under the equity method of accounting mentioned specifically below were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and the determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired has been estimated in accordance with

executed definitive agreements to sell two noncore assets for aggregate proceeds of approximately  million  these transactions include a natural gas storage facility and a noncore pipeline segment and are expected to close during the first half of  note  —goodwill goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized in accordance with fasb guidance we test goodwill to determine whether an impairment has occurred at least annually as of june  and on an interim basis if it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value goodwill is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management our reporting units are our operating segments fasb guidance requires a twostep quantitative approach to testing goodwill for impairment however we may first assess certain qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we did not elect to apply this qualitative assessment during our  annual goodwill impairment test but proceeded directly to the twostep quantitative test in step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the respective book values including goodwill by using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow analysis this approach requires us to make longterm forecasts of future revenues expenses and other expenditures those forecasts require the use of various assumptions and estimates the most significant of which are net revenues total revenues less purchases and related costs operating expenses general and administrative expenses and the weighted average cost of capital fair value of the reporting units is determined using significant unobservable inputs or level  inputs in the fair value hierarchy when the fair value is greater than book value then the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered impaired if the book value is greater than fair value then we proceed to step  in step  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the book value a goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value through step  of our annual testing of goodwill for potential impairment which also includes a sensitivity analysis regarding the excess of our reporting unit’s fair value over book value we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially greater than its respective book value therefore goodwill was not considered impaired we did not recognize any material impairments of goodwill during the last three years goodwill by segment and changes in goodwill is reflected in the following table in millions   transportation   facilities

billion  including working capital adjustments of  million  for our interest in bridgetex distributions received from unconsolidated entities are classified based on the nature of the distribution approach which looks to the activity that generated the distribution we consider distributions received from unconsolidated entities as a return on investment in those entities to the extent that the

we identify the risks that underlie our core business activities and use risk management strategies to mitigate those risks when we determine that there is value in doing so  our policy is to use derivative instruments for risk management purposes and not for the purpose of speculating on hydrocarbon commodity referred to herein as “commodity” price changes  we use various derivative instruments to manage our exposure to i commodity price risk as well as to optimize our profits ii interest rate risk and iii currency exchange rate risk  our commodity price risk management policies and procedures are designed to help ensure that our hedging activities address our risks by monitoring our derivative positions as well as physical volumes grades locations delivery schedules and storage capacity  our interest rate and currency exchange rate risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor our derivative positions and ensure that those positions are consistent with our objectives and approved strategies  when we apply hedge accounting our policy is to formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our risk management objectives for undertaking the hedge  this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction the nature of the risk f table of contents being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness will be assessed  both at the inception of the hedge and throughout the hedging relationship we assess whether the derivatives employed are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of anticipated hedged transactions commodity price risk hedging our core business activities involve certain commodity pricerelated risks that we manage in various ways including through the use of derivative instruments  our policy is to i only purchase inventory for which we have a market ii structure our sales contracts so that price fluctuations do not materially affect our operating income and iii not acquire and hold physical inventory or derivatives for the purpose of speculating on commodity price changes  the material commodityrelated risks inherent in our business activities can be divided into the following general categories commodity purchases and sales — in the normal course of our operations we purchase and sell commodities  we use derivatives to manage the associated risks and to optimize profits  as of december    net derivative positions related to these activities included • a net long position of  million barrels associated with our crude oil purchases which was unwound ratably during january  to match monthly average pricing • a net short time spread position of  million barrels which hedges a portion of our anticipated crude oil lease gathering purchases through january  • a crude oil grade basis position of  million barrels through december  these derivatives allow us to lock in grade basis differentials • a net short position of  bcf through may  related to anticipated sales of natural gas inventory • a net short position of  million barrels through december  related to anticipated net sales of our crude oil and ngl inventory pipeline loss allowance oil — as is common in the pipeline transportation industry our tariffs incorporate a loss allowance factor that is intended to among other things offset losses due to evaporation measurement and other losses in transit  we utilize derivative instruments to hedge a portion of the anticipated sales of the allowance oil that is to be collected under our tariffs  as of december    our pla hedges included a long call option position of  million barrels through november  natural gas processingngl fractionation — we purchase natural gas for processing and operational needs additionally we purchase ngl mix for fractionation and sell the resulting individual specification products including ethane propane butane and condensate  in conjunction with these activities we hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of the natural gas and the subsequent sale of the individual specification products  as of december    we had a long natural gas position of  bcf which hedges our natural gas processing and operational needs through december  we also had a short propane position of  million barrels through december  a short

determined that substantially all of our physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception interest rate risk hedging we use interest rate derivatives to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated interest payments occurring as a result of debt issuances  the derivative instruments we use to manage this risk consist of forward starting interest rate

commensurate quantities loss contingencies  — general to the extent we are able to assess the likelihood of a negative outcome for a contingency our assessments of such likelihood range from remote to probable if we determine that a negative outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable we accrue an undiscounted liability equal to the estimated amount  if a range of probable loss amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount then we accrue an undiscounted liability equal to the minimum amount in the range  in addition we estimate legal fees that we expect to incur associated with loss contingencies and accrue those costs when they are material and probable of being incurred we do not record a contingent liability when the likelihood of loss is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the likelihood of loss is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote for contingencies

regulatory and environmental matters although we are insured against various risks to the extent we believe it is prudent there is no assurance that the nature and amount of such insurance will be adequate in every case to fully protect us from losses arising from current or future legal proceedings taking into account what we believe to be all relevant known facts and circumstances and based on what we believe to be reasonable assumptions regarding the application of those facts and circumstances to existing laws and regulations we do not believe that the outcome of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved including those described below will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows environmental — general although over the course of the last several years we have made significant investments in our maintenance and integrity programs and have hired additional personnel in those areas we have experienced and likely will experience future releases of hydrocarbon products into the environment from our pipeline rail storage and other facility operations these releases can result from accidents or from unpredictable manmade or natural forces and may reach surface water bodies groundwater aquifers or other sensitive environments damages and liabilities associated with any such releases from our existing or future assets could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated generally our recording of these accruals coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action we do not discount our environmental remediation liabilities to present value we also record environmental liabilities assumed in business combinations based on the estimated fair value of the environmental obligations caused by past operations of the acquired company we record receivables for amounts recoverable from insurance or from third parties under indemnification agreements in the period that we determine the costs are probable of recovery environmental expenditures that pertain to current operations or to future revenues are expensed or capitalized consistent with our capitalization policy for property and equipment expenditures that result from the remediation of an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future profitability are expensed at december    our estimated undiscounted reserve for environmental liabilities including liabilities related to the line  incident as discussed further below totaled  million  of which  million was classified as shortterm and  million was classified as longterm at december    our estimated undiscounted reserve for environmental liabilities including liabilities related to the line  incident totaled  million  of which  million was classified as shortterm and  million was classified as longterm the short and longterm environmental liabilities referenced above are reflected in “accounts payable and accrued liabilities” and “other longterm liabilities and deferred credits” respectively on our consolidated balance sheets at december    we had recorded receivables totaling  million for amounts probable of recovery under insurance and from third parties under indemnification agreements of which  million was reflected in “trade accounts receivable and other receivables net” and  million was reflected in “other longterm assets net” on our consolidated balance sheet at december   we had recorded  million of such receivables of which  million was reflected in “trade accounts receivable and other receivables net” and  million was reflected in “other longterm assets net” on our consolidated balance sheet in some cases the actual cash expenditures associated with these liabilities may not occur for three years or longer our estimates used in determining these reserves are based on information currently available to us and our assessment of the ultimate outcome among the many uncertainties that impact our estimates are the necessary regulatory approvals for and potential modification of our remediation plans the limited amount of data available upon initial assessment of the impact of soil or water contamination changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment and the possibility of existing or future legal claims giving rise to additional liabilities therefore although we believe that the reserve is adequate actual costs incurred which may ultimately include costs for contingencies that are currently not reasonably estimable or costs for contingencies where the likelihood of loss is currently believed to be only reasonably possible or remote may be in excess of the reserve and may potentially have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows f table of contents specific legal environmental or regulatory matters line  incident  in may  we experienced a crude oil release from our las flores to gaviota pipeline line  in santa barbara county california  a portion of the released crude oil reached the pacific ocean at refugio state beach through a drainage culvert following the release we shut down the pipeline and initiated our emergency response plan a unified command which includes the united states coast guard the epa the california office of spill prevention and response and the santa barbara office of emergency management was established for the response effort cleanup and remediation operations with respect to impacted shoreline and other areas has been determined by the unified command to be complete subject to continued shoreline monitoring our current “worst case” estimate of the amount of oil spilled representing the maximum volume of oil that we believed could have been spilled based on relevant facts data and information is approximately  barrels as a result of the line  incident several governmental agencies and regulators initiated investigations into the line  incident various claims have been made against us and a number of lawsuits have been filed against us we may be subject to additional claims investigations and lawsuits which could materially impact the liabilities and costs we currently expect to incur as a result of the line  incident set forth below is a brief summary of actions and matters that are currently pending on may   we received a corrective action order from the united states department of transportation’s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” the governmental agency with jurisdiction over the operation of line  as well as over a second stretch of pipeline extending from gaviota pump station in santa barbara county to emidio pump station in kern county california line  requiring us to shut down purge review remediate and test line  the corrective action order was subsequently amended on june   november   and june   to require us to take additional corrective actions with respect to both lines  and  as amended the “cao” among other requirements the cao also obligates us to conduct a root cause failure analysis with respect to line  and present remedial work plans and restart plans to phmsa prior to returning line  and  to service the cao also imposes a pressure restriction on the section of line  between pentland pump station and emidio pump station and requires us to take other specified actions with respect to both lines  and  we intend to continue to comply with the cao and to cooperate with any other governmental investigations relating to or arising out of the release excavation and removal of the affected section of the pipeline was completed on may   line  and line  have been purged and are not currently operational no timeline has been established for the restart of line  or line  on february   phmsa issued a preliminary factual report of the line  failure which contains phmsa’s preliminary findings regarding factual information about the events leading up to the accident and the technical analysis that has been conducted to date on may   phmsa issued its final failure investigation report regarding the line  incident phmsa’s findings indicate that the direct cause of the line  incident was external corrosion that thinned the pipe wall to a level where it ruptured suddenly and released crude oil phmsa also concluded that there were numerous contributory causes of the line  incident including ineffective protection against external corrosion failure to detect and mitigate the corrosion and a lack of timely detection and response to the rupture the report also included copies of various engineering and technical reports regarding the incident by virtue of its statutory authority phmsa has the power and authority to impose fines and penalties on us and cause civil or criminal charges to be brought against us while to date phmsa has not imposed any such fines or penalties or pursued any such civil or criminal charges with respect to the line  release their investigation is still open and we may have fines or penalties imposed upon us or civil or criminal charges brought against us in the future on september   we received a notice of probable violation and proposed compliance order from phmsa arising out of its inspection of lines  and  in august september and october of  the “ audit nopv”  the  audit nopv alleges that the partnership committed probable violations of various federal pipeline safety regulations by failing to document or inadequately documenting certain activities on october   the partnership filed a response to the  audit nopv  to date phmsa has not issued a final order with respect to the  audit nopv nor has it assessed any fines or penalties with respect thereto however we cannot provide any assurances that any such fines or penalties will not be assessed against us in late may of  the california attorney general’s office and the district attorney’s office for the county of santa barbara began investigating the

line and encouraged any parties that were damaged by the release to contact us to discuss their damage claims we have received a number of claims through the claims line and we are processing those claims for payment as we receive them in addition we have also had nine class action lawsuits filed against us six of which have been administratively consolidated into a single proceeding in the

to compel the production of certain books and records that purportedly relate to the line  incident our alleged failure to comply with certain regulations and other matters these lawsuits have been consolidated into a single proceeding in the chancery court for the state of delaware we have also received several other individual lawsuits and complaints from companies and individuals alleging damages arising out of the line  incident these lawsuits and claims generally seek compensatory and punitive damages and in some cases permanent injunctive relief in addition to the foregoing as the “responsible party” for the line  incident we are liable for various costs and for certain natural resource damages under the oil pollution act and we also have exposure to the payment of additional fines penalties and costs under other applicable federal state and local laws statutes and regulations  to the extent any such costs are reasonably estimable we have included an estimate of such costs in the loss accrual described below taking the foregoing into account as of december    we estimate that the aggregate total costs we have incurred or will incur with respect to the line  incident will be approximately  million  which estimate includes actual and projected emergency response and cleanup costs natural resource damage assessments and certain third party claims settlements as well as estimates for fines penalties and certain legal fees this estimate considers our prior experience in environmental investigation and remediation matters and available data from and in consultation with our environmental and other specialists as well as currently available facts and presently enacted laws and regulations we have made assumptions for i the expected number of remaining days that monitoring services will be required ii the duration of the natural resource damage assessment and the ultimate amount of damages determined iii the resolution of certain third party claims and lawsuits but excluding claims and lawsuits with respect to which losses are not probable and reasonably estimable and excluding future claims and lawsuits iv the determination and calculation of fines and penalties but excluding fines and penalties that are not probable and reasonably estimable and v the nature  extent and cost of  legal services that will be required in connection with all lawsuits claims and other matters requiring legal or expert advice associated with the line  incident our estimate does not include any lost revenue associated with the shutdown of line  or  and does not include any liabilities or costs that are not reasonably estimable at this time or that relate to contingencies where we currently regard the likelihood of loss as being only reasonably possible or remote we believe we have accrued adequate amounts for all probable and reasonably estimable costs however this estimate is subject to uncertainties associated with the assumptions that we have made for example the amount of time it takes for us to resolve all of the current and future lawsuits claims and investigations that relate to the line  incident could turn out to be significantly longer than we have assumed and as a result the costs we incur for legal services could be significantly higher than we have estimated in addition with respect to fines and penalties the ultimate amount of any fines and penalties assessed against us depends on a wide variety of factors many of which are not estimable at this time where fines and penalties are probable and estimable we have included them in our estimate although such estimates could turn out to be wrong accordingly our assumptions and estimates may turn out to be inaccurate and our total costs could turn out to be materially higher therefore we can provide no assurance that we will not have to accrue significant additional costs in the future with respect to the line  incident we have accrued such estimate of aggregate total costs to “field operating costs” on our consolidated statement of operations as of december    we had a remaining undiscounted gross liability of  million related to this event of which approximately  million is presented as a current liability in “accounts payable and accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet with the remainder presented in “other longterm liabilities and deferred credits” we maintain insurance coverage which is subject to certain exclusions and deductibles in the event of such environmental liabilities subject to such exclusions and deductibles we believe that our coverage is adequate to cover the current estimated total emergency response and cleanup costs claims settlement costs and remediation costs and we believe that this coverage is also adequate to cover any potential increase in the estimates for these costs that exceed the amounts currently identified through december    we had collected subject to customary reservations  million out of the approximate  million of release costs that we believe are probable of recovery from insurance carriers net of deductibles therefore as of december    we have recognized a receivable of approximately  million for the portion of the release costs that we believe is probable of recovery from insurance net of deductibles and amounts already collected of this amount approximately  million is recognized as a current asset in “trade accounts receivable and other receivables net” on our consolidated balance sheet with the remainder in “other longterm assets net” we have substantially completed the cleanup and remediation efforts excluding longterm site monitoring activities however we expect to make payments for additional costs associated with restoration and monitoring of the area as well as natural resource damage assessment legal professional and regulatory costs in addition to fines and penalties during future periods f table of

the san joaquin valley air pollution control district the “sjv district” we believe we fully complied with all applicable regulatory requirements and that the permits issued to us by the sjv district

issued a notice of probable violation and proposed civil penalty relating to an approximate  barrel release of crude oil that took place on january   on our mesa to basin ” pipeline in midland texas phmsa conducted an accident investigation and reviewed documentation related to the incident and concluded that we had committed probable violations of certain pipeline safety regulations in the notice phmsa maintains that we failed to carry out our written damage prevention program and to follow our pipeline excavationditching and backfill procedures on four separate occasions and that such failures resulted in outside force damage that led to the january   release  phmsa’s compliance officer has recommended that we be assessed a civil penalty of    we have formally responded to phmsa regarding this matter but at this point we can provide no assurance regarding the final disposition of this matter or the final amount of any civil penalties environmental remediation we currently own or lease and in the past have owned and leased properties where hazardous liquids including hydrocarbons are or have been handled these properties and the hazardous liquids or associated wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the us federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended and the us federal resource conservation and recovery act as amended as well as state and canadian federal and provincial laws and regulations under such laws and regulations we could be required to remove or remediate hazardous liquids or associated wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators and to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater we maintain insurance of various types with varying levels of coverage that we consider adequate under the circumstances to cover our operations and properties the insurance policies are subject to deductibles and retention levels that we consider reasonable and not excessive consistent with insurance coverage generally available in the industry in certain circumstances our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to gradual pollution with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences assets we have acquired or will acquire in the future may have environmental remediation liabilities for which we are not indemnified we have in the past experienced and in the future likely will experience releases of crude oil into the environment from our pipeline and storage operations we also may discover environmental impacts from past releases that were previously unidentified insurance pipelines terminals trucks or other facilities or equipment may experience damage as a result of an accident natural disaster terrorist attack cyber event or other event these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations we maintain various types and varying levels of insurance coverage that we consider adequate under the circumstances to cover our operations and properties and we selfinsure certain risks including gradual pollution and named windstorm with respect to our insurance our policies are subject to deductibles and retention levels that we consider reasonable and not excessive however such insurance does not cover every potential risk that might occur associated with operating pipelines terminals and other facilities and equipment including the potential loss of significant revenues and cash flows the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured indemnified or reserved against or the failure of a party to meet its indemnification obligations could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition we believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage although insurance will not cover many types of interruptions that might occur will not cover amounts up to applicable deductibles and will not cover all risks associated with certain of our assets and operations additionally we selfinsure certain risks including gradual pollution and named windstorm with respect to our insurance coverage no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable as a result we may elect to selfinsure or utilize higher deductibles in certain other insurance programs in addition although we believe that we have established adequate reserves and liquidity to the extent such risks are not insured costs incurred in excess of these reserves may be higher or we may not receive insurance proceeds in a timely manner and may potentially have a

transportation facilities and supply and logistics  see “revenue recognition” in note  for a summary of the types of products and services from which each segment derives its revenues our chief operating decision maker “codm” our chief executive officer evaluates segment performance based on measures including segment adjusted ebitda as defined below and maintenance capital investment the measure of segment adjusted ebitda forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is the primary performance measure used by our codm in assessing performance and allocating resources among our operating segments during the fourth quarter of  we modified our primary segment performance measure to segment adjusted ebitda from segment profit and thus prior period segment disclosures have been recast to reflect this change prior to the fourth quarter of  our primary segment measure did not include certain adjustments described further below that our codm believes are useful in evaluating the core operating performance of our segments we define segment adjusted ebitda as revenues and equity earnings in unconsolidated entities less a purchases and related costs b field operating costs and c segment general and administrative expenses plus our proportionate share of the depreciation and amortization expense of unconsolidated entities and further adjusted for certain selected items including i the marktomarket of derivative instruments that are related to underlying activities in another period or the reversal of such adjustments from a prior period gains and

applicable amounts subsequently recognized into revenue and v other items that our codm believes are integral to understand our core segment operating performance segment adjusted ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization maintenance capital consists of capital expenditures for the replacement of partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the operating andor earnings capacity of our existing assets as an mlp we make quarterly distributions of our “available cash” as defined in our partnership agreement to our unitholders we look at each period’s earnings before noncash depreciation and amortization as an important measure of segment performance the exclusion of depreciation and amortization expense could be viewed as limiting the usefulness of segment adjusted ebitda as a performance measure because it does not account in current periods for the implied reduction in value of our capital assets such as crude oil pipelines and facilities caused by agerelated decline and wear and tear we compensate for this limitation by recognizing that depreciation and amortization are largely offset by repair and maintenance investments which act to partially offset the aging and wear and tear in the value of our principal fixed assets these maintenance investments are a component of field operating costs included in segment adjusted ebitda or in maintenance capital depending on the nature of the cost capital expenditures made to expand the existing operating andor earnings capacity of our assets are classified as expansion capital capital expenditures for the replacement of partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the operating andor earnings capacity of our existing assets are classified as maintenance capital which is deducted in determining “available cash” repair and maintenance expenditures incurred in order to maintain the day to day operation of our existing assets are charged to expense as incurred the
