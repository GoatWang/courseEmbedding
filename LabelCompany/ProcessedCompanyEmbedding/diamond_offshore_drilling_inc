available in the industry today advanced training facility questions call  about diamond offshore current job openings home video the ocean endeavor journey video the ocean endeavor completes a wellplanned perfectly executed journey loading the video early in  the ocean endeavor was scheduled to move to romanian waters in anticipation of planned exploration wells in the area but before any drill bit could bite into the silty sea bottom the rig had to go through a series of carefully planned perfectly executed steps to get there the mobilization phase of the project started in midjanuary  and some  days  nautical miles and  manhours later the endeavor commenced drilling its first well typically when a contract ends diamond offshore will relocate a rig anywhere in the world where it is needed next in fact contracts in recent years had seen the massive endeavor towed from singapore to the gulf of mexico to egypt in relative terms this latest trip from egypt to nearby romania looked to be a quick and easy jaunt but there were two very thin yet very formidable obstacles standing in the way  two sleek bridges soar  meters  feet high over the bosphorus more than enough clearance for the worlds largest ships to pass safely below but the bridge designers didnt count on a seagoing vessel with an enormous pointed tip towering  meters  feet skyward to get the endeavor underneath the derrick would have to be taken off laid down for the passage and put back up on the other sidein effect the most challenging limbo contest diamond offshore has ever attempted breaking the ocean endeavor basically in half took a lot of careful planning the disassembly approach began with reviewing how the rig had been constructed knowing that the derrick was built in three sections and the cranes go up piece by piece the diamond offshore engineering team basically reverse engineered it the ocean endeavor was originally designed to work in tropical environments so all the piping was exposed to accommodate the black sea environment about five kilometers of heat tracing were installed on the rig and certain areas with a high concentration of piping and equipment were closed off this was not only a good economical decision but also makes for a cleaner rig important consideration was also given to the rig’s crew the endeavor was originally equipped with numerous air conditioners but no heaters as a result  heaters were installed in different workspaces throughout the rig along with  tank heaters to keep potable water salt water and drill water from freezing with all this new equipment on board eight power substations had to also be installed just to run the new equipment the ocean endeavor mobilization to the black sea spanned over a six month period and was the first of its kind in diamond offshore history this is mainly due to the size of the rig coupled with the scale of the project including the unique challenges of crossing the bosphorus straight a challenging project accomplished ontime and with no recordable safety incidents legal site map corporate profile diamond offshore drilling inc  is a leader in offshore drilling providing contract

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object

to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump

call  about diamond offshore current job openings home video the ocean endeavor journey video the ocean endeavor completes a wellplanned perfectly executed journey loading the video early in  the ocean endeavor was scheduled to move to romanian waters in anticipation of planned exploration wells in the area but before any drill bit could bite into the silty sea bottom the rig had to go through a series of carefully planned perfectly executed steps to get there the mobilization phase of the project started in midjanuary  and some  days  nautical miles and  manhours later the endeavor commenced drilling its first well typically when a contract ends diamond offshore will relocate a rig anywhere in the world where it is needed next in fact contracts in recent years had seen the massive endeavor towed from singapore to the gulf of mexico to egypt in relative terms this latest trip from egypt to nearby romania looked to be a quick and easy jaunt but there were two very thin yet very formidable obstacles standing in the way  two sleek bridges soar  meters  feet high over the bosphorus more than enough clearance for the worlds largest ships to pass safely below but the bridge designers didnt count on a seagoing vessel with an enormous pointed tip towering  meters  feet skyward to get the endeavor underneath the derrick would have to be taken off laid down for the passage and put back up on the other sidein effect the most challenging limbo contest diamond offshore has ever attempted breaking the ocean endeavor basically in half took a lot of careful planning the disassembly approach began with reviewing how the rig had been constructed knowing that the derrick was built in three sections and the cranes go up piece by piece the diamond offshore engineering team basically reverse engineered it the ocean endeavor was originally designed to work in tropical environments so all the piping was exposed to accommodate the black sea environment about five kilometers of heat tracing were installed on the rig and certain areas with a high concentration of piping and equipment were closed off this was not only a good economical decision but also makes for a cleaner rig important consideration was also given to the rig’s crew the endeavor was originally equipped with numerous air conditioners but no heaters as a result  heaters were installed in different workspaces throughout the rig along with  tank heaters to keep potable water salt water and drill water from freezing with all this new equipment on board eight power substations had to also be installed just to run the new equipment the ocean endeavor mobilization to the black sea spanned over a six month period and was the first of its kind in diamond offshore history this is mainly due to the size of the rig coupled with the scale of the project including the unique challenges of crossing the bosphorus straight a challenging project accomplished ontime and with no recordable safety
