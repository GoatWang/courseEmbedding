inc and its parent company cui global inc nasdaqcui announced a limited exclusivity agreement today for hardware development with virtual power systems vps a cutting edge software defined power® company the companies will partner to set a new standard for an efficient power infrastructure for data centers with this agreement cui will design manufacture and distribute the hardware component of the ice intelligent control of energy system that realizes the full value of the vps solution the ice block hardware is managed and controlled through the ice platform a tightly integrated suite of software developed by vps the ice block will enable data center operators to double power and server utilization reduce costs and greatly improve availability this partnership between the two organizations is the first step in creating a larger software defined power ecosystem from board level to system level ultimately creating a more intelligent more efficient data center infrastructure “we continue to look for partners that add value to the entire power ecosystem” said matt mckenzie president of cui inc “this partnership is the first that is outside of the power supply itself and adds significant value to our entire power infrastructure portfolio from board to rack level” through numerous surveys and studies data center power consistently emerges as the most critical area that needs to be addressed to support the growth of ”internet of things” mobile and supporting infrastructure the first ice block is under development now with initial prototype installs coming later in  “we see vps’s patented technology as a difference maker for the data center but we also see value in other markets going forward” added mckenzie “a true software defined power ecosystem requires a collaborative effort and our partnership with vps is the first of many we will look to so we can continue to support this space in new and innovative ways” an existing data center can see up to a  reduction in power cost coupled with the avoidance of  of conventional capex investment with the combined ice system in addition this new infrastructure will enable data centers to continue their aggressive growth paths via a solution that can be installed and initialized in just days vs the months required with traditional approaches data center operators can immediately experience significant improvements in operational flexibility utilization and management “vps needed a partner that could move quickly understood the value of software defined power and had the design capabilities required to develop the hardware that could mate with our innovative software cui became the logical choice as our hardware partner” said shankar ramamurthy ceo of virtual power systems
