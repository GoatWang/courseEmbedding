integrated with a keen home smart vent system gives you ultimate control over comfort and energy usage in your home data is shared cloud to cloud between the ecobee and keen home platforms allowing your smart vents to respond intelligently to temperature limits the keen home app supports multiple ecobee thermostats and as many sensors as you needwhat does the ecobee integration dointegrating your ecobee with your smart vents system gets you three new features in the keen home apptemperature limits we use data from your ecobee and room sensors to understand your household target temperature and hvac mode and state by integrating your ecobee and ecobee room sensors give you access to a new feature called “temperature limit” with temperature limit you set a target temperature for each room and your smart vents will automatically close when that target is reached this prevents rooms from being overheated and overcooled and redirects air towards rooms that need it moreset “hold” temperature configure your ecobee’s hold temperature right from the keen home app this is useful for preheating your home while you are away or cooling down the upstair bedroom before bed in

onlydo i need extra ecobee room sensorsdepends on what you want to do do you have enough room sensors to cover each room where you have smart vents rooms that do not have sensors cannot use the temperature limit featuredo the smart vents replace my ecobee room sensorsno smart vents detect hvac duct temperature which is used to understand hvac state and safety ecobee’s room sensors detect room temperature in relation to wherever they are mounteddoes the smart vent “call for heat or ac” to specific roomsno the primary difference between our temperature limit and a traditional thermostat zone is that temperature limit will not “call for heat” in other words for heating mode you temperature limit is the maximum temperature your system will allow for the room before your smart vents close to dampen airflow to it this does not change wholehome temperature at your ecobeedo i use the ecobee app or the keen home appyou use the keen home app to manage this integrationcan it support multiple thermostatsyes with the ecobee integration you can add multiple ecobee thermostats our app also support an additional “not connected” thermostat zonewill this integration work with ecobee lite smart sense or other ecobee thermostatsyour keen home smart vents will work with your ecobee and ecobee lite but we do not officially support other ecobee thermostat modelsintegration supporthow does temperature limit worktemperature limit is our new feature that allows you to use your smart vents and ecobee room sensors like a roombyroom thermostat when you have a room with a smart vent and room sensors you can set a temperature limit at which the smart vent will automatically open or close to prevent overshooting the target temperature this redirects air to rooms that have not hit their limit and reduces hvac run time overall it balances room temperatures and lets each room be treated like an independent zone in our testing temperature limit can shift room temperature by  degreesthe temperature limit looks like it should have closed the vent but it is open or vice versathis is likely due to one or two thingsyour hvac system is off smart vents do not move when your home is not being actively heated or cooledyou have a schedule set that has triggered your vents to be opened or closedcheck the state of your hvac system and double check you don’t have any schedules set for those vents that should solve the problemwhich app controls my scheduleecobee uses setbacks to save energy by not running the hvac when you aren’t home it also has separate temperature setting for bedtime or other “comfort settings” since rooms schedules such as the one we use for smart vents have to do with room occupancy not home occupancy like ecobee the two schedules serve different purposes we are working on a new feature called “keen follow me” that uses the motion sensors in ecobee room sensors to automatically mark rooms as unoccupied when they are emptywhat is the difference between temperature limits and balance modetemperature limits let you set temperature thresholds that trigger a response from your smart vents when a given limit is reached balance mode takes into account how you want airflow distributed throughout your home and coordinates your smart vents meet your needs for example if it is winter and you tell your smart vents to warm your bedroom while in balance mode the vents in your bedroom would all open to maximize airflow while all of the other vents in your home would close slightly to drive more air to your bedroomhow do i add my ecobee

schedules work with my ecobee home scheduleroom schedules function differently than home schedules so for now the schedules you set for rooms in your keen home app do not interact with your ecobee home schedule we do plan to leverage room sensor data to inform room schedules in the near futurewhy is my room sensor in the keen home app showing a different number than the in ecobee appecobee

keen home smart vent editors note keen home has released some hardware and firmware updates that have significantly changed the product experience our review has been updated to reflect those changesa few months ago i tested keen home smart vents and gave them a poor review terrible connectivity made some of the features practically untestable and a design flaw made ceiling installations dangerous with ample feedback from users and reviewers keen home continued work on its product now these  smart vents are beginning to look compellingthe idea behind keens vents is that you can personalize the temperature of individual rooms around your house if one room tends to get colder in the winter the vents can direct more heat to it or if you like your bedroom cooler you can divert warm air away from it on a basic level keen performs if youre interested in smart vents or you have a compatible smart thermostat keen home vents are definitely worth checking out especially as their features continue to develop  these smart vents leave us cold pictures setupthe keen home system takes some time to set up but its hard to imagine how anyone could make it much easier the real hassle is actually perching on a ladder to install ceiling vents if you have them or screwing the fixtures into the wall keen has also remedied most of the old connectivity problems so syncing the vents to the hub is a breeze tyler lizenbycnet in my experience the installation takes to minutes per unit depending on how many you install it could take an hour or an afternoon once the setup is complete using the keen home app is intuitive the app is streamlined and now when you run into connection problems with a vent the app realizes it and automatically pulls up troubleshooting recommendations i like this addition especially after my original experience with the system that left me confused and exasperateddesignwhere keen vents excel is in design now that the fallingfromtheceiling problem is fixed users are left with a minimalist aesthetic that works with almost any decor the white faceplates attach magnetically onto the vent itself so unlike traditional vents you can simply pull off the plate to clean the slats or change the batteries tyler lizenbycnet even without the faceplate the vents look slick a small led light recessed in the structure of the vent itself is the primary means of communication between user and device and for the most part its blinking patterns are easy to understand green for connected yellow for searching for connection and so on but just in case i found it

their smart vent on february th heavy interviewed the two founders ryan fant and nayeem hussain here’s the insight they gave into their company that changes the way we regulate temperatures in our homes to read all of heavy’s shark tank coverage click here  the founders met at nyu they were both pursuing mbas at new york university’s stern school of business when asked how their new york city location had helped launch their company hussain said there are worldclass universities in the area producing amazing design and engineering talent as well as marquee hardware companies like makerbot canary and quirky further raising the profile of new york’s hardware scene also being in the financial capital of the world doesn’t hurt when looking to raise capital for a business the men were

reenters the ‘shark tank’  fast facts you need to know  the idea came in ryan’s apartment fant who has experience as a consultant for fortune  manufacturing and distribution companies got the idea because his bedroom had only one vent that would give off too much air during the night he thought how great it would be if he could control the air with his smartphone and knew the product did not yet exist when he went to visit his parents over thanksgiving that year he started to envision the bigger picture of vents being used throughout an entire home to regulate the temperatures he then employed the assistance of his classmate hussain fant explained “nayeem has a vast amount of leadership experience across various industries including finance real estate and technology read more from heavy phonesoap enters the ‘shark tank’  fast facts you need to know  it controls room temperature with a smartphone or tablet fant explained to us that on average homes have two to four rooms that are either too hot or too cold their system actually reduces the running time of central heating and cooling systems by  percent the smart vents use a lowpower wireless network to connect to a central hub in your home this hub can be controlled from any smartphone or tablet in order to set the temperature to your liking you can use the smart vent with preexisting floor wall and ceiling air vents in

disrupt ny startup battlefield a startup launch competition they put their product on indiegogo see their crowdsourcing campaign here they more than met their goal raising  although they got useful

alabama hvacr also have a degree in hvacr this is the worse product you could ever have on the market it is so limited to use smh brian february th  gosh daniel am i allowed to adjust my traditional vents without fear that the house will explode what’s the difference between this and traditional vents regarding the same strategy to save on the electric bill brion february th  gosh shut down onenthird ofnyour vents make sure you put some cash aside to have new heat exchanger replaced also pls spend  bucks on a quality co alarm so you dont die in your sleep colin may th  there is no “saving” to be had virtually every system in the us is undersized closing vents just makes it worse lbl proved you save nothing by opening vents if they wanted to improve the situation that would find a way to open vents even wider not shut them down incredibly bad idea that has been tried before worthless brian february th  according to cnet each vent has a pressure sensor that opens the vent a little if it feels the system starting to strain the manufacturer also recommends that not all vents in your house be replaced by these only  or fewer evidently it’s intended to help with vents that may be difficult to reach or that may be in rooms that are difficult to heat or cool so you fears…are for nothing brion february th  so install them on you dytem and save big bucks…lmao mp february th  lol that’s not how it works you can’t “feel the system strain” with a pressure sensor at a closed vent you have to know how much airflow is getting through the system colin genge july th  when radio activity was discovered companies offered radioactive cures that killed their customers now with wifi customers like to believe wifi can fix anything in this case this company has their science all wrong based on my discussions with them they have no clue how systems operate and recently asked what type of pressure gauge they should use to measure pressures inside duct work by their own admission they have not studied the issues but insist on making claims anyway veterans in the hvac science community all believe these vents will not save energy and will put the system longevity and the health of their customers at risk if these vents are placed in rooms that over oversupplied they will restrict system airflow too much and if installed in rooms that are undersupplied they cannot increase flow so in both cases they are useless i have been testing hvac systems for  years and know that virtually every system i see cannot have its airflow reduced to net positive effect they have  experience so how can they make any claims at all pure marketing flim flam the sad fact is that if they truly wanted to make a product that worked they probably could but they need to do their homework first i offered to loan them  worth of diagnostic instrumentation and they didn’t even respond anyone want to buy some radioactive tonic brion february th  this product has the potential to cause deaths through causing cracks and leaks in heat exchangers for heaters and causing costly problems with coolong systems brion february th  this will cuase issuses with both traditional systemn and newer energy saving systems daniel segers february th  i agree turn a  ton into a  ton lol people have no idea systems aren’t designed for this product brian february th  but your worst case scenario seems even more likely with current vent designs and would be alleviated with this computer controlled system which could ensure that all the vents would never be completely closed auto closing of all vents throughout a hotel for example if there’s a fire would reduce the spread of fires some traditional vents already have a fire control feature discuss on facebook post to cancel
