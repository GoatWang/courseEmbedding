connected to an input of a pump system having at least two displacement chambers and in a manner to control the proportions of each constituent that are taken into each chamber during its intake stroke the outputs of the chambers are connected to a common liquid output the chambers are driven by independently controllable motors so that the discharge stroke may be chosen to have some

proportion of constituents may be made different each time one of the chambers is filled so the simultaneous discharge of the chambers allows a gradual carefully controlled change from the mixture of
