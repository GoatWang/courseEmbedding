what you were looking formagnifying glasshelpful reviews shamco management corpjanet s ratedas a working professional i usually don’t have the time to write many reviews unless the situation really stands out to me i have lived at  glenwood avenue east orange new jersey  one of shamco management properties for little over two years as a tenant my apartment is very nice and it is very quiet on my floor which i love if i have any repair issues i can call the  hr hotline number or the property manager and she will make sure my repairs get completed within a timely mannerin the recent past there were things i did not like as a tenant and i communicated that to management in those instances it is my impression they listened intently to my complaints and addressed those matters expeditiously over a short course of time i have watched the management improved our living situation within weeks  ie mounting new cameras on each floor so tenants can feel safer and packages can be left at the door installing new carpeting in the hallways of each floor which makes a world of a difference in the feel and aesthetics of the overall building setup an onsite free business center equipped with computers for tenant use open a free state of the art gym where tenants can work out safely and conveniently a new lighting system for the parking lot has also been installed allowing for a brighter area and a deterrent to predators in conjunction to installing new lights for the back exit area near the garbage acting as an added preventative to criminals and the many other new exciting things they will be doing in the near future by making these improvements management is showing me as a tenant that they care about their tenants safety and enjoyment this makes me want to stay here indefinitely i would definitely recommend this building to potential new tenantsinnovation accounting  tax services pcdavid w ratedi have never been so wonderfully taken care of for any service for
