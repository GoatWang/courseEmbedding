entirety where a definition or use of a term in a reference that is incorporated by reference is inconsistent or contrary to the definition of that term provided herein the definition of that term provided herein is deemed to be controllingfield of the inventionthe field of the invention is hydrometallurgy particularly as it is related to the extraction or recovery of rare earth elements or lanthanidesbackgroundrare earth elements also known as the lanthanide family of elements are commercially valuable metals that are generally present in low abundance in commercially accessible ores and often are often found with undesirable contaminating elements for example thorium in a typical process for isolation of a member of the lanthanide family hot sodium hydroxide at high concentrations is used to generate soluble lanthanide hydroxide and thorium hydroxide from ore the mixture of hydroxides is then treated with hydrochloric acid to generate lanthanide chlorides which are soluble and remain in solution and a sludge of thorium hydroxide which has reduced solubility at the altered ph unfortunately this process can leave significant amounts of thorium in solution following acid treatment since this element is radioactive significant further refinement steps are necessary to assure its removal adding significantly to processing costs in addition the use of a strong base at an elevated temperature both presents a hazard to workers and requires the use of specialized equipment thus there is a pressing need for efficient effective and scalable methods for the isolation of rare earth elements at high puritynumerous approaches have been devised to attempt to address these issues hydrometallurgy or the extraction of metals from ores through treatment with lixiviant solutions ie lixiviants is one approach that has been used successfully for the isolation of metals from a variety of minerals and other sources in typical hydrometallurgical processes ore is crushed or pulverized to increase surface area prior to exposure to a lixiviant which contains compounds that render the metal soluble in the solution and leave behind undesirable contaminants following collection of the solution the metal can be recovered from the solution by various means such as by electrodeposition or by precipitation from the solution commercial development of hydrometallurgical processes however is often hindered by the expenses involved in production and use of the lixiviant efficient recovery of the desired metal and difficulties in adapting current commercial plantsin an approach disclosed in us pat no  to virnig and michael metals are solubilized in an aqueous lixiviant containing ammoniacal thiosulfate and extracted into an immiscible organic phase containing guanidyl or quaternary amine compounds metals are then recovered from the organic phase by electroplating a similar approach is disclosed in us pat no  to perraud in which metals are extracted from an aqueous phase into an organic phase that contains an amine chloride the organic phase is then contacted with a chloridefree aqueous phase that extracts metal chlorides from the organic phase amines are then regenerated in the organic phase by exposure to aqueous hydrochloric acid such approaches however are hindered by the use of volatile amines in the lixiviant and necessarily involve the use of expensive and potentially toxic organic solventsin a related approach european patent application no ep to kocherginsky and grischenko discloses a membranebased method in which copper is initially complexed with ammonia or organic amines the copperammonia complexes are captured in an organic phase contained within the pores of a porous membrane and the copper is transferred to an extracting agent held on the opposing side of the membrane while such an approach minimizes the use of organic solvent it requires the use of complex equipment that is not readily adaptable to current processing facilities in addition the capacity of such a process is necessarily limited by the available surface area of the membranekodama et al energy   disclose a method for co capture using calcium silicate caosio and a solution of ammonium chloride nhcl this reaction forms soluble calcium chloride cacl which is reacted with carbon dioxide co under alkaline conditions to form insoluble calcium carbonate caco that captures co while releasing chloride ions cl— japanese patent application no  to katsunori and tateaki discloses a similar method for co capture in which ammonium chloride nhcl is dissociated into ammonia gas nh and hydrochloric acid hcl the hcl being utilized to generate calcium chloride cacl that is mixed with ammonium hydroxide nhoh for co capture kodama et al and katsunori and tateaki however fail to recognize hydrometallurgical applications of such reactions and rare earth elements are not considered in addition the loss of highly volatile ammonia during processing results in both inefficiencies and the need for specialized equipment to reduce environmental impactinternational application wo  to tavakkoli et al discloses a method for purifying calcium carbonate caco in which caco from high content sources is converted to calcium oxide cao by calcination the resulting cao is treated with an ammonium chloride nhcl solution to produce calcium chloride cacl which is subsequently reacted with high purity carbon dioxide co to produce caco and nhcl high purity caco is subsequently recovered from the solution by crystallization using seed crystals tavakkoli et al however does not consider rare earth elements and it is not clear if such an approach can be used with low content or highly contaminated starting materials in addition utilization on a large scale would require capturing or containing the highly volatile ammonia gas that results from such a processall publications identified herein are incorporated by

ammonia derivatives in addition to nitrogen containing organic compoundshydrometallurgical methods such as leaching have long been used to recover commercially valuable metals from low yield sources such as mine tailings inventors have discovered a hydrometallurgical method for the recovery of rare earth elements ie rare earth metals such as members of the lanthanide family through the use of lixiviants that include organic amines in addition inventors have determined that such organic aminebased lixiviants can be regenerated during andor after processing permitting the organic amines to act in a pseudocatalytic manner this pseudocatalytic behavior allows the organic amines to be applied in substoichiometric amounts in addition the selectivity of certain organic amines can permit

groups used in the appended claimsembodiments of the inventive process can include at least one compound of the general composition depicted in compound  for use with any source of material that contains one or more a forms of a lanthanide hydroxide forming species that can be hydrated to form lnohx or other hydrated species that would react with lixiviants of the form found in compound  such hydrated forms may be present in the material as it is obtained from nature or can be introduced by processing for example through treatment with a base or by oxidation and can be stable or transient selective extraction of the desired lanthanide can be based on the presence of a metal hydroxide that has a stronger basicity than the organic aminebased lixiviants used in the extraction process in addition an organic amine based lixiviant and counterion can be selected that permit use of the organic amine in substoichiometric amounts ie as a pseudocatalystorganic amines of the inventive concept have the general formula shown in compound  where n is nitrogen h is hydrogen and x is a counterion ie a counter anion nyrrrh—xz compound suitable counterions can have a pka ranging from about  to about  and can be any form or combination of atoms or molecules that produce the effect of a negative charge counterions can halides for example fluoride chloride bromide and iodide anions derived from mineral acids for example nitrate phosphate bisulfate sulfate silicates carbonate  and bicarbonate cations derived from organic acids for example carboxylate citrate malate acetate thioacetate propionate and lactate organic molecules or biomolecules for example acidic proteins or peptides amino acids nucleic acids and fatty acids and others for example zwitterions and basic synthetic polymers for example ammonium chloride nhcl conforms to compound  where there is one nitrogen n r r and r are hydrogen and there is one counter anion x which is chloride cl— compounds having the general formula shown in compound  can have a wide range of acidities and an organic amine of the inventive concept can be selected on the basis of its acidity so that it can selectively react with one or more rare earth metal salts or oxides from a sample containing a mixture of rare earth metal salts or oxides such a compound when dissolved in water or another suitable solvent can for example effectively extract the rare earth element cerium presented in the form cerium hydroxide in a suitable sample eg alkaline opened monazite equation  depicts a primary chemical reaction in extracting an insoluble lanthanide salt in this instance a hydroxide salt from a matrix using an organic amine cation oahcounterion ci− complex oahci− as a lixiviant note that the oahci− complex dissociates in water into oahand ci− lnohsolid oahaq claq lnciaq oa aq ho equation  the counterion ci− is transferred from the organic amine cation oah to the lanthanide salt to form a soluble lanthanidecounterion complex lnci an uncharged organic amine oa and water once solubilized the lanthanidecounterion complex can be recovered from solution by any suitable means for example addition of a base that reacts with the lanthanidecounterion complex to form an insoluble lanthanide salt can be used to precipitate the extracted lanthanide from supernatant following removal of unreacted material alternatively ph changes temperature changes or evaporation can be used to precipitate the solubilized lanthanide in other embodiments the lanthanide could be recovered by electrodeposition processes such as electrowinning or electrorefining in still other embodiments of the inventive concept the solubilized lanthanide can be recovered by ion exchange for example using a fixed bed reactor or a fluidized bed reactor with appropriate media it should be appreciated that the process of recovering the lanthanide can be selective and that such selectivity can be utilized in the recovery of multiple lanthanides as described belowthe organic amine cationcounterion complex can be produced from the uncharged organic amine to regenerate the oahci− lixiviant for example using an acid form of the counterion h—ci as shown in equation  oaaqh—ciaq oahaqci− equation  in a preferred embodiment of the inventive concept the reaction described in equation  can occur in parallel with the reaction described in equation  for example by the addition of an acid form of the counterion hcl during the period in which the lixiviant is in contact with the sampleit should be appreciated that an important feature of this process is the ability to exploit “chemical gain” through the regeneration of the lixiviant in which the organic amine acts as a pseudocatalyst this permits the use of substantially less than stoichiometric amounts of the lixiviant to recover all of the extractable active metal species as a soluble salt although it is not necessary to use less than the stoichiometric amount of lixiviant doing so has the technical effects of reducing the environmental impact of such processes and of substantially reducing expenseorganic amines suitable for the extraction of of rare earth elements for example from the ores monazite bastnasite xenotime and other materials can have a pka of about  to about  and can include protonated ammonium salts ie not quaternary suitable organic amines can include ammonia nitrogen containing organic compounds for example monoethanolamine diethanolamine triethanolamine morpholine ethylene diamine diethylenetriamine triethylenetetramine methylamine ethylamine propylamine dipropylamines butylamines diaminopropane triethylamine dimethylamine and trimethylamine low molecular weight biological molecules for example glucosamine amino sugars tetraethylenepentamine amino acids polyethyleneimine spermidine spermine putrecine cadaverine hexamethylenediamine tetraethylmethylenediamine polyethyleneamine cathine isopropylamine and a cationic lipid biomolecule polymers for example chitosan polylysine polyornithine polyarginine a cationic protein or peptide and others for example a dendritic polyamine a polycationic polymeric or oligomeric material and a cationic lipidlike material or combinations of these such organic amines can range in purity from about  to about  for example an organic amine of the inventive concept can have a purity of about  about  about  about  about  about  about  about  about  about  about  about  or about  in a preferred embodiment of the inventive concept the organic amine is supplied at a purity of about  to about  it should be appreciated that such organic amines can differ in their ability to interact with different members of the lanthanide family and with contaminating species and that such selectivity can be utilized in the recovery of multiple lanthanides as described belowinventors further contemplate that zwitterionic species can be suitable lixiviants and note that such zwitterionic species can form cationcounterion pairs with two members of the same or of different molecular species examples include amine containing acids for example amino acids and aminopropanoic acid chelating agents for example ethylenediaminetatraacetic acid and salts thereof ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid and salts thereof diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid and salts thereof and bisoaminophenoxyethanennn′n′tetraacetic acid and salts thereof and others for example betaines ylides and polyaminocarboxylic acidsit is notable that the use of biologically derived organic amines is a sustainable practice and has the beneficial effect of making this process more environmentally sound in addition it should be appreciated that some organic amines such as monoethanolamine have a reduced tendency to volatilize during processing than other organic amines such as ammonia in some embodiments of the inventive concept an organic amine can be a low volatility organic amine ie having a vapor pressure less than or equal to about  that of ammonia under process conditions in other embodiments of the inventive concept an organic amine can be a nonvolatile organic amine ie having a vapor pressure less than or equal to about  that of ammonia under process conditions capture and control of such low volatility and nonvolatile organic amines requires relatively little energy and can utilize simple equipment this reduces the likelihood of such low volatility and nonvolatile organic amines escaping into the atmosphere and advantageously reduces the environmental impact of their usean example of an application of the inventive concept is in the isolation of insoluble cerium hydroxide from a monzanite ore that also includes an undesirable thorium impurity using an ammonium chloride lixiviant equation  represents a reaction that takes place on contacting a monzanite process mud with an ammonium chloride lixiviant ceohsolid nhaq claq ceclaq nhaq ho equation  cerium is extracted from the ore as soluble cerium chloride cecl with the generation of uncharged ammonia nh and water the lixiviant is regenerated through the addition of hydrochloric acid hcl as shown in equation  nhaqhaqclaq nhaqclaq equation  advantageously lixiviant can be regenerated during the extraction process by the addition of hcl in such a process production of cerium chloride is controlled by the amount of lixiviant present relative to the amount of extractable metal ions and the rate at which hydrochloric acid is added to the system it should be appreciated that in such a process either the organic amine cation ammonium salt or the unprotonated organic amine ammonia can be used initially subsequently once the lixiviant has transferred its anion fresh acid can be added to support the protonation of the organic amine so that further metal salt can be extracted since the protonation of the organic amine occurs in the solution phase the reaction rate is much greater than direct contact of acid with solid metal oxidehydroxide the regenerated lixiviant can then undergo selective reaction with rare earth hydroxides according to equation  in such a process cerium salts can be selectively extracted from process muds in a continuous manner via the reactions in equation  and equation  until all the cerium hydroxide is consumed or the addition of acid is ceased the extent of reaction can be characterized conveniently by monitoring the ph of the reacting solution since thorium hydroxide in the process mud is not sufficiently basic to react with the lixiviant the cerium hydroxide reacts preferentially and is extracted selectively by the lixiviant as a result the thorium remains behind in the process mudit should be appreciated that systems methods and compositions of the inventive concept can also be used to selectively extract andor refine a desired rare earth element such as cerium from an ore containing other contaminants for example other rare earth elements by using the lixiviants described herein one skilled in the art can exploit the varying degrees of basicity associated with each rare earth element and choose a lixiviant of corresponding acidity to achieve selective extractionit should be noted that the lixiviant allows for the selective extraction of cerium hydroxide in this example because it does not react with other metals or metal oxideshydroxides of lower basicity that are found in the processing muds and solutions for example zero valency metals mo are not reactive with the lixiviant as shown in equation  mosnhaq  no reaction equation  this selectivity is in contrast with prior art methods that do not utilize a lixiviant of the inventive concept where acid will react nonselectively with zero valency metals equation  cerium hydroxide equation  and other potential metal oxideshydroxides for example thorium oxide equation  mshaq→maqhg equation  ceohshaq→ceaqho equation  thoshaq→thaqho equation  the use of the lixiviant in this pseudocatalytic manner acts as a proton shuttle allowing for the selective reaction with in this example but not limited to cerium hydroxidethe soluble cerium salt for example cerium chloride from equation  and the soluble ammonia from equation  or soluble ammonium ion if the reaction is metal oxidehydroxide limited can easily be separated from the insoluble solid residue once separated the soluble aqueous fraction can be used asis if the target process can tolerate the small quantity of ammonia or ammonium chloride as a contaminant alternatively the solution can be further processed as neededas noted above in some instances the use of a low volatility andor nonvolatile lixiviant is desirable an example of such a process of the inventive concept is the extraction of cerium ce from an ore using a nonvolatile organic amine such as monoethanolamine hydrochloride as shown in steps a to f of fig  as shown instep a of fig  a tank  or other suitable arrangement includes an aqueous solution of an organic amine  in this instance monoethanolamine and a mud or slurry  containing cerium hydroxide ceoh thorium oxide tho and thorium hydroxide thoh the extraction process can be initiated as shown in step b of fig  by the addition of an acid form of a counterion  in this instance hydrochloric acid hcl which generates an organic acid cationcounterion pair  in this instance monoethanolamine hydrochloride meacl— monoethanolamine hydrochloride meahcl hochnhcl conforms to compound  as follows one nitrogen atom n is bound to one carbon atom rcho and  hydrogen atoms r r and h and there is one chloride counteranion xcl— as shown in step c of fig  this compound when dissolved in water or another suitable solvent can enter or mix with the mudslurry and as shown in step d of fig  effectively extract a rare earth hydroxide for example cerium hydroxide ceoh by the formation of a soluble rare earth cationcounterion pair  in this instance cerium chloride cecl equation  depicts a critical chemical reaction in such an extraction in this case cerium from an alkaline opened mined ore source with significant thorium content note that meahcl dissociates in water into monoethanolammonium cation hochnhmeah and chloride anion cl— ceohs hochnhaq claq→ceclaq hochnh aq ho equation  as illustrated in step d of fig  this process also generates an uncharged organic amine  in this instance monoethylamine mea the organic amine cationcounterion pair  can be regenerated as shown in step e of fig  from the reaction products of equation  by the addition of the corresponding acid  in this instance hcl as shown in equation  hochnh aqhclaq→hochnhaqcl— equation  this process can be repeated eventually leading to the depletion of the rare earth element from the mud or slurry which retains the unwanted thorium contaminants  as shown in step f of fig as in the example utilizing ammonium chloride this process advantageously utilizes “chemical gain” in which the meahcl acts as a pseudocatalyst one can use substantially less than stoichiometric amounts of the lixiviant to recover all of the desired extractable active metal species as a soluble salt this has both economic and environmental benefits and additionally simplifies any necessary subsequent product purification stepsthe metal salt production is controlled by the amount of lixiviant present relative to the amount of extractable metal ions and the rate of acid added to the system when first starting the process either the ammonium salt or the unprotonated organic amine may first be used subsequently once the anion is consumed fresh acid can be added to provide protonation of the organic amine so that further metal salt can be produced because the protonation of the organic amine occurs in exclusively in the solution phase the reaction rate is much greater than direct contact of acid with metal oxide the regenerated lixiviant can then undergo selective reaction with cerium hydroxide according to equation  in this manner cerium can selectively be extracted from waste material in a continuous manner via the reactions in equation  and equation  until all the cerium hydroxide is consumed or addition of acid is ceasedit should be reiterated that the lixiviant allows for the selective extraction of cerium in this example because it does not react with other metals or metal oxideshydroxides in the monazite process mud slag eg thorium oxide does not react with the lixiviant see equation  thoshochnhaq→no reaction equation  whereas in the absence of the lixiviant the acid will react unselectively with thorium oxide equation  and cerium hydroxide equation  as well as other potential metals and metal oxideshydroxidesthe soluble cerium salt and the soluble mea from equation  or soluble meah if reaction is metal oxidehydroxide limited can easily be separated from the insoluble solid residue once separated the soluble aqueous fraction can used asis if the target process can withstand the small quantity of lixiviant as a contaminant or the solution can be furthered processed as neededthe rare earth element containing solution can be concentrated or diluted to a desired strength as required by the end user alternatively the solution can be boiled down or evaporated completely leaving a rare earth element chloride andor various hydrates thereof depending on how vigorously the mixture is dried the residual uncharged organic amine could also be removed by this process and optionally captured for reuse the dried rare earth element chlorides could be further processed into oxides via thermal oxidation precipitation with agents such oxalic acid sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide or other precipitating agentsin another embodiment of the inventive concept mixture of rareearth hydroxides can be extracted for further refinement in such an embodiment an organic amine lixiviant and reaction conditions can be selected that produce a mixture of rare earth element cationcounterion pairs in solution and leaves undesired contaminants in the insoluble slag the mixture of rare earth element cationcounterion pairs could be separated from residual lixiviant by for example precipitation with a hydroxide alternatively rare earth element salts could be recovered by drying or other solvent removal technique in such an approach a relatively volatile lixiviant such as for example ammonia can be selected to simplify removal and recovery of the organic amine the most basic rare earth element present for example lanthanum hydroxide can be selectively extracted by exposing the rare earth element hydroxide mixture precipitate to an amount of a second aminebased lixiviant that is just acidic enough for the lanthanum to be selectively extracted the resulting solution could then be concentrated or diluted to a desired strength as required by downstream processesthere are of course many possible lixiviants of the form of compound  and there are likewise many organic amines and rare earth element sources while the examples provided have described the action of two organic amine lixiviants ie ammonium chloride and monoethanolamine hydrochloride aka monoethanolammonium chloride with one particular cerium source monazite other examples of process of the inventive concept can utilize organic amine cationcounterion pairs such as ammonium acetate monoethanolammonium acetate ammonium nitrate or monoethanolammonium nitrate alternatively biologically derived lixiviants such as the amino acid glycine or a salt of itself or the hydrobromide salt of polyllysine can be used similarly while examples note the use of monazite ore other ores such as xenotime euxenite allanite loparite samarskite aeschynite fergusonite parasite synchisite tengerite ancylite florencite britholite thalenite gadolinite and eudialyte are suitable alternatively systems methods and compositions of the inventive concept can be utilized to recover rare earth elements from electronic waste consumer waste industrial waste scrap or other excess materials from manufacturing processes or other postutilization sources any source that contains a basic form of a rare earth metal can be suitable for example alkaliprocessed monazite sands that contain thorium compounds can be used as a source material in methods of the inventive concept in preferred embodiments the rare earth source is a rare earth hydroxide that can be separated from a matrix using an acid for example hclmany rare earth elements on the periodic table can form hydroxides most of these have very limited solubility in water these hydroxides also have varying degrees of basicity while cerium iii hydroxide as produced from various mineral sources has been cited as an example there are many other rare earth elements that form suitable bases in water examples of other elements that in hydroxide form are suitable for use in systems and methods of the inventive concept include scandium yttrium lanthanum praseodymium neodymium promethium samarium europium gadolinium terbium dysprosium holmium erbium thulium ytterbium and leutetium such salts have different basicities which can be paired with organic amine based lixiviants of different acidities to provide selective recoveryit should also be noted that systems methods and compositions of the inventive concept are not limited to one metal species being extracted with one particular lixiviant or set of anions multiple metal species with various organic amine based lixiviants and various anions or acids can be used in sequence or in parallel to extract a particular mixture of metals or to produce a particular mixture of metal saltsas described above lixiviants of the inventive concept can be applied in a variety of methods examples of some of these methods are depicted schematically in fig  fig  and fig fig  depicts a method of the inventive process  in which a sample  for example an ore or other source or rare earth metal is mixed with a lixiviant  the lixiviant can include a solvent and one or more organic amine species as described above in the form of a cation coupled with a suitable counterion for example chlorine andor other halides suitable solvents include any protic or highly polar solvent or any solvent that can solvate large amounts of rare earth metal salts in preferred embodiments of the inventive concept the solvent is water a glycol or a waterglycol mixturethe organic amine component of the lixiviant can be chosen based on selectivity efficiency or economic considerations suitable organic amine species can be described by compound  above in some embodiments the organic amine can be a bromide chloride acetate or nitrate salt of diethanolamine or triethanolamine in other embodiments the organic amine can be a chloride or acetate salt of an amino acid for example glycine or lysine in preferred embodiments of the inventive concept the organic amine can be ammonium chloride or monoethanolamine chloride similarly the concentration of organic amine can be selected for optimal or improved performance as noted above the organic amine can be utilized in substoichiometric amounts however this is not a requirement for example a monovalent organic amine can be used at concentrations and volumes that give about a molar ratio of about  to about  relative to the amount of available rare earth metal in the sample in such an embodiment higher organic amine to rare earth element molar ratios can be utilized in batch processing operations in which the lixiviant is not constantly regenerated through the addition of acidthe sample  can be treated physically andor chemically prior to mixing with the lixiviant  for example the components of the sample  can be reduced in size for example through milling grinding pulverizing or sifting in some embodiments components of the sample can have a mean diameter of about  mm to about  mm after such processing in other embodiments components of the sample can have a mean diameter of about  mm to about  mm after such processing in preferred embodiments of the inventive concept components of the sample can have a mean diameter of about  mm to about  mm such processes improve the surface area to volume ratio of elements of the sample and can serve to increase reaction rates in some embodiments a sample can be chemically treated for example through exposure to strong bases such as sodium hydroxide heating oxidation or a combination of these such chemical treatments can serve to generate rare earth metal salts for example hydroxides or oxides or to alter the physical structure of the sample or components of the sampleon interacting with the lixiviant  rare earth elements in the sample interact with organic amine cations and counterions to form a soluble rare earth element cationcounterion complex that is solubilized in the supernatant  along with an uncharged organic amine this extraction process can be rapid reaching completion in about  hours to about  hours in preferred embodiments the extraction time is from about  hours to about  hours the mass ratio of rare earth element to solvent can be adjusted to improve process efficiency in some embodiments the ratio of rare earth element to solvent ratio is about  to about  in other embodiments the ratio of rare earth element to solvent is about  to about  in preferred embodiments of the inventive concept the ratio of rare earth element to solvent is about  to about other parameters can be adjusted during the extraction process in order to optimize the selectivity and efficiency of the extraction process for example temperature and mixing speed in some embodiments the temperature during extraction can be from about ° c to about ° c in other embodiments the temperature during extraction is about ° c to about ° c in a preferred embodiment of the inventive concept the temperature during extraction is about ° c similarly during extraction the mixture of sample and lixiviant can be stirred at about  rpm to about  rpm in preferred embodiments the mixture of sample and lixiviant can be stirred at about  rpm to about  rpmin the extraction process unwanted contaminants are not solvated by the lixiviant and remain behind as insoluble material for example as a treated sample  that can be further processed if desired the ph of the lixiviant can change during the extraction process ranging from about ph  to about ph  at the beginning of the extraction and from about ph  to about ph  at the end of the extraction process such ph changes can provide an indication of the progress of the reaction or alternatively can be used to indicate a need to regenerate the lixiviant the supernatant  can be separated from the insoluble materials of the treated sample  by a variety of processes including settling filtration or centrifugation either alone or in combination the rare earth cation  can be recovered from the supernatant  by any suitable means including electrodeposition precipitation for example by the addition of a base such as hydroxide and ion exchange in a preferred embodiment insoluble materials are removed by filtration in such embodiments the efficiency of the process can be improved by washing the filter cake of insoluble material to recover additional lixiviant containing solubilised rare earth elements however this must be weighed against the impact of dilution on subsequent steps in some embodiments the filter cake is washed with a liquid volume of about  times the volume of the cake wetness in other embodiments the filter cake is washed with a liquid volume of about  times the volume of the cake wetness in preferred embodiments the filter cake is washed with a liquid volume of about  times the volume of the cake wetnessthe uncharged organic amine remaining in the supernatant  can in turn be regenerated  to form an organic amine cation that can form part of a lixiviant  that can be used in the next cycle of the reaction for example if a supernatant  is treated with an acidic form of the counterion of the lixiviant  the uncharged organic amine can be converted to an organic amine cationcounterion pair that can be used as a lixiviant  in the next application of the method in preferred embodiments of the organic concept an acidic form of the counterion can be added to the mixed first supernatant and sample  to regenerate the charged organic aminecounterion pair in situ  the acid used for regeneration can be any acid that is able to maintain the rare earth salt solubility in the lixiviant for example hbr hcl or acetic acid in a preferred embodiment the acid is hcl it should be appreciated that in such an embodiment the organic amine can act as a pseudocatalyst serving to shuttle counterions to rare earth element components of the sample while not being consumed this advantageously permits the use of the organic amine in substochiometric amounts relative to the rare earth element content of the sample which limits both the environmental impact of such operations and permits considerable savings in materialsother embodiments of the inventive concept can advantageously utilize the selective complex formation and solubility of components of methods of the inventive concept to recover different rare earth elements from the same sample one example of such a method is shown in fig  as shown such a method can be a chain of reactions that are essentially one or more repetitions of the method shown in fig  applied to a progressively depleted sample in an example of such a method  a sample  and a first lixiviant  are brought into contact with each other the first lixiviant  includes a first organic amine cation and a counterion and reaction  with the sample  produces a first depleted sample  and a first supernatant  that includes a first rare earth cation a counterion and an uncharged organic amine the first depleted sample  includes materials that were not reactive with the first lixiviant which can include additional rare earth elements other valuable materials and unwanted contaminants it can be separated from the first supernatant  by any suitable method including settling filtration and centrifugation either alone or in combination the first rare earth cation  can be recovered from the first supernatant  by any suitable means including electrodeposition precipitation for example by the addition of a base such as hydroxide and ion exchange the uncharged first organic amine remaining in the supernatant  can in turn be regenerated  to give a first organic amine cation that can form part of a first lixiviant  that can be used in the next cycle of the reaction the first depleted sample  can in turn be contacted  with a second lixiviant  that includes a second organic amine cationcounterion pair reaction with the first depleted sample  produces a second depleted sample  and a second supernatant  that includes a soluble second rare earth element cationcounterion complex and uncharged second organic amine the second rare earth cation  can be recovered from the second supernatant  by any suitable means including precipitation for example by treatment with a base that forms an insoluble salt electrodeposition andor ion exchange uncharged second organic amine can be treated  for example with an acid form of the counterion to regenerate the second lixiviant  in some embodiments of the inventive concept the second depleted sample  is subjected to further rounds of treatment with lixiviants in order to recover additional valuable materials it should be appreciated that as described in the process illustrated in fig  that an acid form of the counterion can be added to the mixtures of lixiviant and sample to regenerate the first organic amine cation  the second organic amine cation  or both the first and second organic amine cations   in situ permitting them to act as pseudocatalysts and permitting the first organic amine the second organic amine or both the first and second organic amine to be used in substochiometric quantities this advantageously permits the use of the organic amine in substochiometric amounts relative to the rare earth element content of the sample which limits both the environmental impact of such operations and permits considerable savings in materialsanother embodiment of the inventive concept that permits recovery of two or more rare earth elements from a sample is shown in fig  in such a method  a sample  is contacted with a lixiviant  that includes a first organic amine cationcounterion pair and a second organic amine cationcounterion pair this mixture  results in a treated sample  and a first supernatant  this first supernatant can include a first rare earth element cationcounterion pair a second rare earth element cationcounterion pair a first uncharged organic amine and a second uncharged organic amine the first rare earth cation  can be recovered from the first supernatant  by any suitably selective means including precipitation with a first precipitant for example by treatment with a base that forms an insoluble salt electroplating or ion exchange recovery of the first rare earth cation  from the first supernatant  yields a second supernatant  which includes a second rare earth element cationcounterion pair an uncharged first organic amine and an uncharged second organic amine the second rare earth cation  can be recovered from the second supernatant  by any suitable means such as precipitation with a second precipitant for example through treatment with additional amounts of a base that forms an insoluble salt electrodeposition or ion exchange following extraction of rare earth elements the second supernatant  can be treated for example by the addition of an acid form of the counterion to regenerate the lixiviant  in some embodiments of the inventive concept the first organic amine and the second organic amine and their respective cations can be different molecular species with different acidities andor specificities for rare earth elements in other embodiments of the inventive concept the first organic amine and the second organic amine can be the same molecular species with selectivity between the first rare earth element and the second rare earth element being provided by the method used for their recovery from supernatants for example in some embodiments the first precipitant and the second precipitant are different species that selectively precipitate the first and second rare earth elements respectively alternatively in other embodiments the first precipitant and the second precipitant are the same species utilized under different conditions for example at different concentrations andor temperatures it should be appreciated that as described in the processes illustrated in fig  and fig  that an acid form of the counterion can be added to the mixtures of lixiviant and sample to regenerate the first organic amine cation the second organic amine cation or both the first and second organic amine cations in situ  permitting them to act as pseudocatalysts and permitting the first organic amine the second organic amine or both the first and second organic amine to be used in substochiometric quantities this advantageously permits the use of the organic amine in substochiometric amounts relative to the rare earth element content of the sample which limits both the environmental impact of
