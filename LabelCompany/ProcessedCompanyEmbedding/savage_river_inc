delivery of my brand new otegan this past weekend and im thrilled and delighted as expected the craftsmanship is impeccable and with wooden gunnels the visual is stunning although racing days are over i was seeking a solo that had strong performance characteristics yet had enough comfort and stability to go tripping and fishing the stability is remarkable for such an efficient hull although not a turn on a dime configuration turning the boat is effortless i get out on flat water  to  times a week and i believe that after  plus years and innumerable boats that ive found the perfect canoe savage river works’ otegan should be considered by the experienced canoeist who… submitted by anonymous on  savage river works’ otegan should be considered by the experienced canoeist who is searching for the ultimate lightweight solo flatwater cruiser in speed maneuverability and ease of effort this boat significantly outperforms topoftheline solos from the major makers – and at a competitive price it’s a slightly detuned sitandswitch race boat  of carbon fiber kevlar and structural foam for yearold me the otegan’s beauty is not in racing but in conservation of effort whether tracking going fast turning or maneuvering it responds to the slightest paddle pressure with a delicacy and precision that still thrill me after  years of ownership unless one wishes to go at top speed it’s not necessary to sitandswitch the extreme tumblehome and narrow beam allow one’s paddle to travel very near the keel line this greatly reduces the effort needed for directional correction so that it’s perfectly comfortable to paddle steadily on one side and cruise at pleasing speed – especially with a bentshaft paddle – especially with the crafts immediate response to a slight j or c touch i only sitandswitch to deal with strong winds or to travel upstream against current otegan’s downriverracer heritage means that it is not suited for heavy water or weather conditions surprisingly however it will carry a payload three hundred pounds of me  gear for  days in algonquin didn’t seem to affect its performance – just made it a little more stable the canoe’s performance in difficult conditions can be extended somewhat by carrying a twopiece kayak paddle  cm seems about right “kayaking” the otegan moves us yep twin otegans in this family handily upstream against current into headwinds through waves up to a foot – or just back home in a hurry initial stability is very twitchy it’s stable when under way but unless one has a very fine sense of balance entering the boat requires care and developing a technique of weighting it very slightly offcenter to engage its secondary stability john diller’s savage river works is in rural western maryland to testpaddle an otegan it’s necessary to go to his shop or to arrange with him to bring one along if he comes to a race near you he builds to order and delivery depends on his work load mine came in  weeks marilyn’s took  weeks

stable than my wenonah ar or wenonah va and  faster the boat is good in boat wash during racing starts it can be turned very quickly when leaned be careful if your canoe is not decked the gunwales
