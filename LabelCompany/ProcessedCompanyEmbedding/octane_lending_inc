viewsponsoreddidnt find what you were looking formagnifying glasshelpful reviews take  talent agencygailguerreraheb ratedim a parent and my experiences were totally fair and honest with take i learned about the agency from a friend whos daughter has had a number of great gigs thanks to take  my son was auditioning on a small level for projects though his drama program he got a few good gigs and almost landed ryan gossling film project i thought may be my son may have something went to take  he was signed and they sent him out on many great audition even with out professional head shot when we went out on auditions we saw all of these great head shots and realized when you represent an agency you must be professional and get the proper photos and that is what we did we were never pushed i was pleased and felt well taken care of they didnt push any photog on me or acting lessons but natasha said if you feel frustrated and arent getting the rolls or call backs may be you need to go and look for acting programs that will help i found that to be completely reasonable heck that goes without saying if acting is what you really want to do then you must work on your craft we also did model management site and the day after i payed the fee for my son to be apart of the site he landed a gig with filip phone the fact is landing a gig falls ultimately on the client take  cant give you a job the casting directors do and i understand that my son hasnt booked anything big but has gotten call backs which to me says a lot the work they do isnt easy they submitt tons of kids i am sure i remember paying for sites to submit my son for various projects if the casting director doesnt select your photo you dont get audition it is that simple it has nothing to do with agency dont shoot the messenger do your homework go with your gut our contract will be up for renewal in the spring it has been slow for us and if things continue in that route i will not sign i will just let it go unless my son wants it badly i can honestly say take  gave my son a fair shot we competed with the best of them for national commercials and many other amazing projects he got to experience being on set and filming all day and going on a photo shoot it was fun fair and honesttake  talent agencysandy l ratedfolks on here with the negative reviews are either feeling slighted in some way because their children didnt get enough casting opportunities or felt some sort of entitlement when their children were given an opportunity by these two agencies but did not see much activity well so you know this is because they werent chosen by the production companies or didnt fall into a certain demo not all ages are as popular and not all looks are as demanding take it from a parent of kids working with take   these negative reviews are without merit and should not be taken seriously we have been with take  for some time and have never been asked for a dime if your child makes money they make money  period they work at all hours of the day and weve received last minute gosee calls in the middle of the night theyre always on their a game slandering a companys name will not make the situation any better bottom line is that if youre not happy somewhere take your chances elsewhere burning bridges will not make things right and these agencies all know each other so in the long run you will only be harming your childs chances take  and its representatives are  stars all the way keep doing a phenomenal job take  talent agencyaimee h ratedwe have been in contact and knwe have been in contact and knowledgeable about producttake  talent for  years now and have nothing but good things to say about them first and foremost the parents who are saying they were scammed are more or less unknowledgeable when it comes to this industry you were not scammed because you chose to pay ten dollars to send a digital request to an agency take  to have them view your child for potential representation they get thousands of submissions a week which requires them to hire someone to look through all of these submissionsthere is where your ten dollar fee comes into play most agencies do not even offer the convenience of online submissionsyou would have to know someone to get an appointment or pay hundreds of dollars to attend a showcase with  other children present if you do not hear anything back from them in their two week specified period and i think it states right on the sitewe will contact you within two weeks if we are interested they simply were not interested in your child no scam about it i have three children and they have been with different agentstwo other big nyc agents so i have had experience with modeltalent agencies and take  really is top notchtake  talent agencypeter o ratedwhomever has accused take  talent as being a scam sound like disgruntled unknowledgeable asses my son has been represented by take  talent for almost  years  natasha chelsea  eddie have never ever suggested or required him to pay for any classeseven though he is a newbie take  has sent him out on so many wonderful auditions  as such he has booked a commercial  received a few callbacks my son has improved so much  has had so much fun because of the wonderful opportunities afforded to us by take  talent success does not happen overnight it is a very gradual process  we are very happy that the patient kind  always professional team of take  talent believe in my son  are always available to help him we are looking forward to future opportunities to grow  succeed as my son continues to flourish thanks to the expert representation  tutelage of the team of take  talent thank you devynjulian oneill  non employees of take  talenttake  talent agencysjaycoleman ratedi dont know who you all are saying all these negative things about product model management all  of my kids are with them and we have never been asked to pay a dime for classes or anything no i am not
