kite value and risk long only value longterm horizon growthsummarykite right now is flying very high in the hopes of a market launch of its cart therapy in  or becoming an acquisition targetstudy results seem promising now but hopes for cart have been crushed in the pastwhile its lead candidate certainly is an extremely interesting product the stock for now remains highly speculative introduction kite pharma nasdaqkite right now is one of the hottest names in the biotech sector and more specifically the field of cancer immunotherapies in simple words kite is trying to help the patients immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells the very core idea of this method is significantly different from other cancer treatments like surgery radiation or chemotherapy lately there has been much enthusiasm about kite and its cart therapy after new results of the latest clinical trial were made public on february th the stock is now up more than  percent compared to the days before the results were released arie s belldegrun the ceo of kite certainly did not even attempt to slow down the enthusiasm by calling the cart program literally one of the biggest breakthroughs in cancer therapy since the introduction of combination chemotherapy more than  years ago if that is so shouldnt every investor jump on the bandwagon as soon as they can this article attempts to have a closer look on what the treatment does who are the competitors and what are other risks which could hurt kites plans to launch the treatment in  so whats all the fuzz about first of all what exactly does cart therapy actually mean the car stands for chimeric antigen receptor and the t for t cells as described above kite is trying to harness the power of the patients own immune system its lead product candidate on which basically all hope in the company is pinned is called axicabtagene ciloleucel now in describing what the treatment does allow me to first rely on kites own words … patients t cells are engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor  car  to target the antigen cd a protein expressed on the cell surface of bcell lymphomas and leukemias and redirect the t cells to kill cancer cells source kite press release february th  the t cells of the patient are modified to target cancer cells by adding a car to the t cells which then binds to a protein that is specific to cells of bcell lymphomas and leukemias while the trial which created the recent buzz around the company was conducted with  patients who suffered from different types of aggressive nonhodgkin lymphoma diffuse large bcell lymphoma primary mediastinal bcell lymphoma and transformed follicular lymphoma kite  according to the pipeline section of its website  is conducting similar trials for a number of other indications which include but are not limited to chronic lymphocytic leukemia mantle cell lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia so basically the enthusiasm around the recent data is not only grounded in a new way to fight specifically aggressive nonhodgkin lymphoma but also in the hope to fight a whole number of different types of cancer with this immunotherapy approach  an approach which created high hopes and much disappointment in the past eg at the end of last year when the competitor juno had to stop its trial after patient deaths in medical terms the death of a patient due to a therapy is called a grade  ae adverse event in kites trial three patients died and two of those deaths were deemed to be related to the treatment as this was already known since summer  and no additional deaths occurred between then and the report of the new results at the end of february the focus of investors and analysts for now naturally went to the no additional deaths part of the news of course also response rates for the treatment looked very impressive in the primary analysis  percent of the patients showed a partial or complete response after only one infusion the study met the primary endpoint of objective response rate orr or rates of tumor response complete response  partial response recorded after a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel with  percent p   source kite press release february th  in fact  percent of the  patients achieved a complete response after  months and a single infusion a fact that was communicated with much enthusiasm by kite these results with axicabtagene ciloleucel are exceptional and suggest that more than a third of patients with refractory aggressive nhl could potentially be cured after a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel source kite press release february th  primarily this now gives hope to patients for whom every other treatment failed the prospect of treating or even curing the disease with a single infusion truly sounds astonishing please note that i am not a medical professional and there are certainly much much better places to learn more about how the treatment works in detail another seeking alpha contributor recently pointed to an interesting video which explains the treatment somewhat understandable for the layman but the numbers for now do not look too bad everything so far sounds quite promising but of course an investor never should get too excited about a company so lets continue to what might still be in the way for kites biggest breakthrough since … more than  years ago competition and other barriers for quite some time juno therapeutics nasdaqjuno has been viewed as a main competitor of kite in the race to bring cart to the market that argument suffered a major blow when junos trial was put on hold after patient deaths last year  after it also showed promising results in general what remains true is that kite certainly is not alone in the cart field while they might be quicker to the market than juno competition might enter the market sooner than kite hopes also junos recent setback illustrates how quickly one can go from hero to zero in this field after all  patients in kites study still is not a very large number next to kite and juno novartis nysenvs is also staying in the cart field while they might have been a little bit late to the game they potentially have vast resources at their disposal to compete with the two much smaller biotech companies competition therefore remains fierce and kite surely cannot rely on being the sole provider of cart treatments if the treatment hits the market another risk on kites way to the market lies within a patent dispute with juno more specifically the patent in question is us patent no  which is licensed by juno and protects car products containing a cd sequence something which also has been employed by kite in its anticd product formerly known as ktec and now known as axicabtagene ciloleucel or  registered as a trademark in   axicel™ for now kite of course remains rather optimistic in public however kite continues to believe the patent to be invalid and plans to appeal the uspto decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit this patent does not have any counterpart patents outside of the united states the usptos decision will have no impact on the timing of the rolling submission or review of the biologics license application for kites lead product candidate axicabtagene ciloleucel source kite press release dec th  so while kite still regards the patent in question as invalid and it is only protecting the cd sequence in the us a significant legal risk remains in fact juno is now suing kite which might make life even more difficult in the future juno is suing kite seeking a declaratory judgement that kites lead product candidate ktec will infringe on  when commercially produced source seeking alpha dec th  also not everybody in the pharmabiotech sector is really enthusiastic about the kind of bespoke cart therapies which kite is offering john f milligan ceo of gilead nasdaqgild for example was rather skeptical about the new approach its a very laborintensive kind of business … those programs are projected to be quite expensive and are more akin to a bone marrow transplant with a lot of supportive care and hospitalization costs and those are the sorts of things that make me nervous john f milligan source bloomberg interview milligan as someone who has been looking intensively to make an acquisition in biotech and even more specifically in oncology certainly had put a fair amount of thought before making the statement above basically hes saying that the treatment potentially isnt very economic because of the high costs while it is true that this kind of individualized therapy sounds more expensive for the provider than conventional therapies nobody really knows what will be the price if or when kite launches it on the market also so far kite cannot stress enough that the responses in the trial occurred after one single infusion of the engineered t cells while cancer most likely never  or at least not in the near future  will be treated or even cured quickly cart could be somewhat of a gamechanger when it comes to the duration of the treatment but it will take more time and more importantly more data to really assess that after all the recent study showed great results and a study with  certainly is not negligible but unfortunately axicabtagene ciloleucel wouldnt be the first next big thing that failed after initially promising results last but not least at this point  as already mentioned above  everything that is said about the pricing of the new therapy is wildly speculative in a recent cnbc interview arie belldegrun  of course  indicated that a true breakthrough should come with a fair price and he meant it from the providers point of view and should be differentiated from a hypothetical new drug which is just a little bit better than the existing ones but for now we can only work with uncertain assumptions launch naturally kite cant wait to bring its lead product to the market in the same press release where the new study results have been disclosed kite could not resist to mention that the therapy is developed under breakthrough status of the fda and therefore might be marketable sooner than some expect axicabtagene ciloleucel has been granted breakthrough therapy designation status for diffuse large bcell lymphoma dlbcl transformed follicular lymphoma tfl and primary mediastinal bcell lymphoma pmbcl by the us food and drug administration fda and priority medicines prime regulatory support for dlbcl in the eu source kite press release february th  so for the sake of argument lets assume all goes well and the treatment hits the market in  as kite hopes it would certainly create a major hype around the company and the stock price would most likely rise even further kite has already opened a squarefoot plant near lax airport the facility should enable the company according to its own statements to treat  to  patients per year the patients of course would not have to travel to california for treatment kite is partnering with vitruvian networks inc for a software solution this is a platform which will connect kite hospitals which offer the treatment treatment centers physicians and patients the goal of the platform is to streamline the logistics that come with the process of providing patients with the engineered t cells kite estimates that the vein to vein time would be approximately  to  days this includes apheresis manufacturing the transportation processes and infusion i stated above that pricing at this point remains wildly speculative therefore i cannot stress enough that the next couple of sentences come with a wide margin of uncertainty if we look at how aggressive nhl is treated now kites therapy would probably be priced in the sixfigures which might cause some political pressure at the beginning remember gileads hcv pricing because marketing a one infusion treatment with a price greater than  might raise a few eyebrows at first this will depend on how good kite will be at selling the cart treatment as a major breakthrough that truly is different from anything else if we would assume an initial low six figure price that would most likely bring us to revenue in the hundreds of millions but not billions with  to  patients per year but kite is thinking even bigger according to a presentation of ceo arie belldegrun the facility near lax airport is scalable due to its modular design also partnerships for commercialization of the treatment were already initiated with fosun pharmaceutical co ltd in china and daiichi sankyo co ltd in japan  big potential markets which would not even be affected by the before mentioned patent issue therefore if everything would go well and that is a big if revenue could be estimated to go up to multiple billions depending on how quickly the company would be able to expand capacities and kites current market cap of around  billion its a volatile stock would most likely go up to doubledigit billions if nobody would acquire it before then again this whole section has been extremely speculative the point is to illustrate that even though the stock has risen quite significantly over the past days and weeks there still is enormous upside potential for kite conclusion while enthusiasm right now is high more clinical data for the treatment is still needed at this point it is still not safe to say that the cart treatment will get to the market soon or even at all pricing of the treatment is still very much uncertain as stated before the process is most likely very expensive for the provider of the treatment personally however i consider this only a minor risk because a true breakthrough in cancer treatment most likely would not fail because people wouldnt pay for it also the abovementioned patent issue remains unresolved this creates another risk which should be considered before buying the stock personally i am long kite i am well aware of the risks which surround the company but clinical data looks really promising and i regard the whole concept of the cart technology basically as already proven in my opinion it is more a matter of when not if the technology hits the market and who becomes the market leader kite is well positioned for a potential launch even in  of course nobody knows how future clinical data will look but given the recent results kite for now might just be one step ahead of its competitors at the end of the day kite  like many if not all biotech companies  still provides the potential investor with both a substantial upside potential but also a very considerable amount of risk if arie belldegrun stands correct kites new product might just be a blessing for shareholders  but much more importantly for patients too
