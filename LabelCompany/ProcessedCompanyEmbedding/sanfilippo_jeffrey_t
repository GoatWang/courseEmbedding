valentine chief financial officer please go ahead sir mike valentine thank you chuck good morning everyone and welcome to our  third quarter earnings call thank you for joining us today on the call with me today is jeffrey sanfilippo our ceo jasper sanfilippo our coo and howard brandeisky our senior vice president of global marketing before we start we may make some forwardlooking statements today these statements are based on our current expectations and they involve certain risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business the factors that could negatively impact results are explained in the various sec filings that we made including forms k and q we encourage you to refer to these filings to learn more about these risks and uncertainties starting with the income statement net sales for the third quarter of fiscal  decreased by  to  million compared to net sales of  million for the third quarter of fiscal  the decrease in net sales was attributable to a  decrease in sales volume and a  decline in the weighted average selling price per pound the decline in the weighted average selling price per pound primarily resulted from lower selling prices for almonds sales volume decreased for all major product types and in all distribution channels as well the decrease in the consumer channel sales volume was primarily attributable to a decline in sales of cashews and mixed nuts with private brand customers sales volume also declined for our branded products in the quarterly comparison as follows sales volume for fisher recipe nuts fell by  primarily due to inventory reduction initiatives implemented by some customers during the third quarter fisher snack nut sales volume decreased by  due to lower merchandising activity sales volume for orchard valley harvest and sunshine country produce brands decreased by  due to a decline in sales for our sunshine country produce brand which resulted from lost distribution the sunshine country sales volume decline was partially offset by a  increase in sales volume for orchard valley harvest produce brand due to increased merchandising activity the decrease in sales volume in the contract packaging channel was attributable to a reduction in merchandising activity implemented by a customer in that channel the sales volume decline in the commercial ingredients channel resulted mainly from lost business with a bulk almond butter customer which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal  net sales for the first three quarters of the current year decreased to  million from  million for the first three quarters of fiscal  the decline in net sales in the yeartodate comparison was primarily attributable to an  reduction in the weighted average selling price per pound which primarily occurred as a result of lower selling prices for almonds and walnuts additionally the decline in net sales was also attributable to a  decrease in sales volume which was driven by lower sales volume for almonds and mixed nuts the volume decline for those nuts was partially offset by sales volume increases for peanuts snack and trail mixes and walnuts sales volume increased in the consumer and contract packaging channels and declined in the commercial ingredients channel the sales volume increase in the consumer channel came mainly from increased sales of fisher recipe nuts orchard valley harvest produce products and private brand snack nuts the sales volume increase in the contract packaging channel resulted primarily from increased sales of snack and trail mixes peanuts cashews and almonds to our existing customers the sales volume decrease in the commercial ingredients channel was driven by the loss of the almond  bulk almond butter customer that we mentioned before and also lower sales of bulk inshell walnuts to international customers and lower sales of peanuts to other peanut shellers third quarter gross profit increased by  and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to  up from  for the third quarter of last year the increases in both gross profit and gross profit margin were primarily related to lower acquisition costs for almonds and improved alignment of selling prices and acquisition costs for pecans and walnuts gross profit for the first three quarters of the current year increased by  and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to  from  for the first three quarters of last year the increases in gross profit and gross profit margin primarily occurred for the same reasons i cited in the quarterly comparison total operating expenses for the current third quarter decreased by  million and total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter increased to  from  for the third quarter of last year total operating expenses for the current yeartodate period decreased by  million and total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to  from  for the first three quarters of fiscal  the decreases in total operating expenses in both comparisons were due to lower advertising expense due to later easter holiday and reductions in compensation and broker commission expenses which were partially offset by an increase in shipping expense the increases in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for bulk comparisons were due to a lower net sales base interest expense for the current third quarter was  which was consistent with the interest expense for the third quarter of last year interest expense for the first three quarters of the current year decreased to  million from  million for the first three quarters of last year the decrease in interest expense in the year to date comparison primarily resulted from lower debt levels during the first half of the current fiscal year net income for the third quarter of fiscal  was  million or  per share diluted compared to net income of  million or  per share diluted for the third quarter of fiscal  net income for the first three quarters of fiscal ‘ was  million or  per share diluted compared to net income of  million or  per share diluted for the first three quarters of fiscal  taking a quick look at inventory total value of inventory on hand at the end of the current third quarter decreased by  million or  compared to the total inventory value on hand at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  the decrease in the total value of inventory on hand was primarily driven by lower quantities of finished goods combined with a lower weighted average cost per pound for finished goods higher acquisition costs for pecans which were largely offset by lower acquisition costs for almonds led to a  increase in the weighted average cost per pound of raw nut and dried fruit input stocks on hand in the quarterly comparison finally i would like to take a moment to alert investors that we will be presenting at the east coast ideas investor conference on wednesday may  at the boston park plaza in boston our presentation is scheduled to begin at  am eastern time and the presentation will be webcast live and may be accessed at the conference website wwwideasconferencecom and now jeffrey sanfilippo our ceo will provide additional comments on our performance in the current quarter jeffrey jeffrey sanfilippo thank you mike good morning everyone following the fifth consecutive year of record second quarter results for net income and diluted earnings per share the company’s third quarter results for net income and eps were also very strong net income of  million and earnings per share of  in this quarter were the secondhighest q results in the company’s history significant performance in spite of the headwinds we faced with volume top line revenue as discussed on previous calls commodity prices commodity price decreases and the loss of a bulk almond butter customer in our commercial ingredients channel had an unfavorable impact on net sales during this quarter in addition we faced decreases in merchandising activity in the consumer and contract manufacturing channels that negatively impacted branded private brand and contract manufacturing volumes to offset the negative impact on net income from this sales decline we recognized that we would have to increase gross profit margin capture savings in our selling and admin expenses and focus on growing sales volume since last year’s third quarter we made significant improvements in managing our walnut inventory aligning our selling prices and acquisition costs and leveraging our procurement expertise to drive the considerable increase in our gross profit margin that occurred in the quarterly comparison we’re also successful in reducing selling and administrative expenses and we accomplished a great deal with continuous improvement projects fixated at quality operating efficiencies and manufacturing costs while sales volume was generally down for our brands at retail our fisher recipe nuts and orchard valley harvest brands outperformed in their respective categories in quarterly comparison according to iri market data our success is due to the entire team effort across the organization these results would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our management team and every one of our employees and i thank each of them for their hard work leadership and support turning to sales review by business channel net sales in the consumer channel decreased by  in dollars and sales volume decreased  in the third quarter of fiscal ‘ the sales volume decrease as mike mentioned was driven by lower volume of cashews and mixed nuts with private brand customers and decreased sales of our branded products we saw changes in private brand strategies with some of our key customers which had a negative impact on volume in the third quarter in addition decreases in merchandising and promotions across both private brand and branded segments in the snack segments negatively impacted volume net sales in the commercial ingredient distribution channel decreased by  in dollars and  in sales volume in the third quarter mainly from lost distribution from that bulk almond butter customer which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal ‘ our efforts to share resources from industrial segment to pursue more profitable business segments are beginning to pay off we’re seeing strong results in food service as we complete the major customer product and brand repositioning work executed over the last few years essentially streamlining who we sell to and what we sell them while driving increased branded product distribution these efforts have driven solid doubledigit growth on fisher and orchard valley harvest branded products in the food service channel further the overall customer and product mix shift is driving margin improvements we have specific initiatives to continue growth of the food service channel with efforts against all three of our strategic pillars first grow jbss brands efforts centered around fisher valueadded products for menu applications and indiscernible flavor variety and quality that consumers demand in addition these products relieve kitchen labor cost pressure of restaurant operators and help with food consistency second expand consumer reach we are focused on distribution and placement of orchard valley harvest snack items this is being executed by adding specific resources that have had success in this area and by performing partnerships with companies that service these locations and third create value with key customers the opportunity to expand with national chain restaurants and strong regional players by adding appropriate culinary resources and developing customized solutions in particular help these customers grow through customized net based menu solutions driving traffic and increase check average we are just starting that work now and while these types of initiatives tend to have longer payback cycles we’re looking for solid results in the coming year net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel decreased by  in dollars and  in sales volume in the third quarter sales volume decrease for the quarterly period was primarily due to reduction in merchandising attributes i mentioned earlier turning now to category updates market information i’ll be referring to is irireported data and for today it is for the  week period ending march   when i refer to q i’m also referring to the  week period ending march  references to changes in volume or price are versus the corresponding period one year ago we look at the category on iri is totally us definition which includes food drug mass walmart military and other outlets unless otherwise specified and when we discuss pricing we are referring to average price per pound breakouts of the recipe snack and produce nut categories are based on our custom definitions developed in conjunction with iri and the term velocity refers to the sales per point of distribution first let me review category dynamics the total nut category was flat in pound volume and declined in dollar sales by  in q overall prices at this macro level declined  versus a year ago now let’s look at each category a little more in depth starting with recipe nuts in q the recipe nut category continued to struggle declining  in dollar sales and  in pound sales walnut pound sales were up  driven by a  decline in weighted average walnut prices versus prior year but the walnut sales pound increase was offset by pecans and almonds pecan pound sales declined  driven by an  increase in average prices versus the prior year and almond pound sales declined  despite a  decrease in average prices consumers continue to migrate to the snack or produce section of the store for almonds as almond pound consumption in both sections increased versus last year despite those category headwinds our fisher brand had a positive quarter and continues to gain momentum behind our integrated marketing efforts fisher recipe nuts increased  in pound sales and was flat in dollar sales in the quarter versus last year as a result fisher pound share in the category increased  points versus last year fisher recipe is a leading branded recipe nut with an overall share of  which is  share points ahead of our nearest branded and competitor the growth was driven by an increase in distribution and velocity distribution measured as acv increased  percentage points versus last year as our sales team continues to translate our retail success into greater retail penetration distribution for fisher recipe nuts is now at  acv with room to continue to grow in addition to the distribution gains pound velocity increased  the velocity growth was driven by strong merchandising performance at new and existing customers and the effectiveness of our brand no preservatives and nongmo messaging our continued brand equity efforts on fisher coupled with our distribution gains helped the brand overcome category weakness and deliver growth in the third quarter now let me turn to the snack category in q the snack category decreased  in dollars and  in pound sales versus last year and weighted average prices decreased  driven by declines in almonds of  and peanut declines of  fisher snack decreased  in sales dollars and  in pound sales as measured by iri this was driven by a decrease of  in total points of distribution and a reduction of merchandising activity by  versus last year we are working on repositioning our fisher snack program to overcome this poor performance our orchard valley harvest brand had a strong third quarter increasing  in dollar sales and  pound sales orchard valley harvest grew faster than the category which was up roughly  in pounds resulting in  cents of a point increase in pound share our velocity increased  behind strong merchandising efforts and our average item per store selling increased  versus last year we have upsized the consumer by migrating them to our multipacks which now comprise  of the dollar sales of the portfolio and velocity on the multipacks is  times that of our minis we continue to build the core business success by launching new products such as omega  mix and dark chocolate covered fruits both in multipacks sunshine country our other brand in the produce section of the store did not perform as well as orchard valley harvest the brand declined  in dollar sales and  in pound sales the brand declined due to lost distribution at a key customer versus the prior year our total produce business orchard valley harvest and sunshine country grew  in pounds in the third quarter compared to a year ago in closing we face a number of challenges in the future such as volatile commodity markets for certain nuts especially pecans and cashews conversely we have seen acquisition costs for tree nuts such as almonds decrease in the  crop year there are headwinds and tailwinds going into the remaining quarter of fiscal ‘ and into fiscal  and the management team remains focused on consistent execution of our corporate goals to create customer and shareholder value we appreciate your participation in the call and thank you for your interest in our company i’ll now turn the call back over to mike mike valentine thank you jeff we will now open the call to questions chuck please queue up the first question questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from francesco pellegrino with sidoti  company your line is open francesco pellegrino so this was a pretty nice quarter despite a lot of components to your top line that didn’t really go your way and i guess just before i dig a little bit deeper pecan cost year over year were they up down or flat jeffrey sanfilippo was it pecan cost i’m sorry i didn’t hear yes it’s a little up this year versus last year significantly francesco pellegrino so your pecan costs were up because i noticed that sales by product type the only product type that increased was pecan i know you’re vertically integrated for pecans walnuts and peanuts so when i just think about the top line struggles i’m thinking that a lot of this margin expansion you got was probably from your cost structure and when i think about your cost structure i think about seller margin and then i also think about your procurement expertise can you maybe just give us a little bit of color in regards to how your sheller margins performed as compared to maybe some favorable impact you got from maybe some opportunistic buying for cashews and almonds as compared to the year ago period mike valentine i can take that francesco in respect to sheller margins we’d like to talk about that in respect to the entire shelling industry so with market increases that we’ve seen with pecans this year we believe that margins for pecan shellers have expanded this year compared to last year francesco pellegrino okay and i guess maybe with some other nuts that you’re not vertically integrated for cashews and almonds if  when you talk about overall sheller industry margin is expanding then i would think that you would be hurt by greater margins for almond shellers and cashew shellers it just seems as if something on your cost structure contributed to have really the impressive quarter and i’m just trying to dig a little bit deeper to see if it would  the nuts that you’re vertically integrated for or maybe it was opportunistic buying for others and i’m not sure if you could give a little bit of color or if you can’t for competitive reasons mike valentine again  i’ll start with sheller margins and i’ll talk about each  entire industry so it’s my belief that with the recent rise in peanut market prices i believe that peanut sheller margins have expanded this year compared to last year we also have seen a recent increase in walnut market prices and i believe the same case could be made for walnut sheller margins so obviously when the entire industry sheller margins expand typically we would expand with them and of course same goes in the other direction as you mentioned before we don’t shell almonds and cashews so a contraction of sheller margins for those particular nuts typically would benefit us jeffrey sanfilippo we’ve got such good visibility from our procurement team just being in the industry so long i think we did a great job at acquiring inventories and managing our positions very well and we do a great job aligning our costs with our selling prices so a lot of times we are the first to market with price changes just because of our visibility and understanding of market dynamics and consumption which helps us francesco pellegrino it’s interesting you say that because in the yearago period you guys actually got burnt on the plummet in walnut prices and i guess really just what i’m getting at is when i look at your investor deck and i look at that slide that has peanut and tree nuts spot market prices versus your rolling  quarter gross margins i see a plummet in almond prices and then i see a quick rebound and i’m just wondering if you guys really lucked out by some strong opportunistic buying maybe for almonds if i try to maybe narrow in a little bit more on my questioning in regards to what contributed to this strong quarter did almond gross profit per pound increase for you guys in this quarter as compared to the yearago period mike valentine sure i’ll take that francesco as i’m ultimately responsible for buying almonds we did have a significant improvement in profitability on almonds this year compared to last year we did we have a lot of expertise in that area and have to give our almond buyer a lot of credit for timing his purchases at the right time francesco pellegrino was it luck or when you think about is the personnel and the skill set i don’t know if you would call it something like tree nut alpha or something how would you put the competency level of these guys against the rest of the industry because it almost seems as if there might be a competitive advantage mike valentine well we’ve always touted the fact that we have probably the most experienced nut procurement team in the industry people with decades of experience and in many cases that experience helps you beat the market and this year i think that was the case especially for almonds jeffrey sanfilippo and then let me also add we’ve talked about this on many calls we have focused on growing a more profitable business more valueadded business with customers that are looking for something differentiated so that helps and also operations team has done a great job driving cost indiscernible profitability as well it’s really a combination of procurement expertise and other things we’re doing in the company francesco pellegrino okay as i said before a lot of your revenue drivers during the quarter weren’t that impressive and you just think if maybe you did have one of those revenue drivers be a little bit stronger how much more impressive of a quarter this could be my question for you is the third quarter of this year so we have this significant decline in total volume sales whether you want to look at the branded category or the private label category and i’m wondering if it’s more of a timing issue and maybe we could see a nice rebound in volume sales in the fourth quarter despite the fact that we are going to be lapping the lost almond butter business i mean maybe given insight into where retailer inventory levels are or just maybe what’s happening with private label could that be rebounding going into the fourth quarter just a little bit of commentary would be helpful with that jeffrey sanfilippo sure let’s take a couple of things one is we have no control over some of our private brand customers in the way they merchandise and the way they set their shelves we saw some adjustments they made in q that impacted q we have since then seen some readjustments so we would expect some of that volume declines to turn around going forward and then as far as merchandising and promotion activity we’re optimistic of volume growth going forward francesco pellegrino i was operating under the assumption that some of the product placement issues at some of these retailers for private label nuts was more of a  issue and that we were going to be favorably lapping that right now but it seems as if some of these situations are getting worse mike valentine almost sounds like jeffrey sanfilippo yes i don’t want to say it’s getting worse there is some inventory loading by some retailers in q so up through december we’re seeing some of that cycle through volume that’s impacted q volume some promotions and some information indiscernible that’s starting to move through that inventory now francesco pellegrino so the product placement last year which was bad is even worse this year which i would think would set up for an easy indiscernible if can just get their act together jeffrey sanfilippo i think it’s a good comment francesco pellegrino okay and if the opportunity for greater volume sales persists into the fourth quarter exists then your finished goods inventory looks a little bit light as compared to the yearago period so would you think that maybe you’re not positioned necessarily well for a strong fourth quarter volume uptick mike valentine we’ll let jasper address that go ahead jasper jasper sanfilippo i would say that our inventory position reflects what we look in our forecast and i think it reflects certainly the demand that we’re foreseeing the position’s typically because of new indiscernible requirements we are having to take shorter positions with respect to ontime deliveries and we’re taking more deliveries from our suppliers quicker so we have better inventory turns due to freshness in additional processing that we have to do on our nuts operator thank you our next question comes from stefan mykytiuk with ack your line is open go ahead please stefan mykytiuk just sorry to be redundant but jeffrey you were breaking up on some of those answers i didn’t hear what you were saying in terms of the  just the volume rebound i guess when i look at q we’ve got another quarter of the almond butter contract rolling off and then last year you had the extra week so i guess as we look to q is it logical to think that we have a similar volume decline in q that we did in q and then in the fall we start to get some of that back jeffrey sanfilippo with the extra week obviously that’s something that we can’t make up from a timing standpoint but we got new business that we’ll be shipping in q we’ve seen changes that impacted q and q from retail or private brand decisions that we had no control over we’re tending to see readjustments they’ve seen the same volume challenges that we’ve experienced from a manufacturing side so we anticipate some of that volume to shift so we wouldn’t see that declining trend but at least stability in that items that indiscernible stefan mykytiuk okay sorry you broke up again in the end so you’re saying that kind of incremental decline we saw in q we get back in q you think from some of the new business or private label coming back jeffrey sanfilippo correct stefan mykytiuk got you but we still have the almond butter and then the extra week that we got to compare against jeffrey sanfilippo cycle through yes exactly stefan mykytiuk and then the overall price decline was  had been coming down the last couple  was down  in q and then  in q and i would have thought that we would have seen like further mitigation in q what was it that all of the sudden turned in q and caused further average price decline mike valentine i can take that jeff there was a further decline in almond prices from q and i think that that kind of bumped it back up stefan mykytiuk got it so in q now with pecan prices going up and peanut prices going up does the average price decline mitigate at all in q or indiscernible mike valentine well i think we started to get into lower almond prices in last year’s q so that large change that we saw in q over q is going to come down quite a bit everything else should be pretty comparable with the last year and then of course we’re going to see increasing cashew prices just as we did a bit in this last quarterly comparison so i don’t think that change in weighted average selling price is going to have as much of an impact on our top line as it did in this current third quarter stefan mykytiuk got it okay and then just one other thing jeffrey you had mentioned kind of headwinds and tailwinds going into next year can you just elaborate a little bit more we’ve probably touched on a few of them here but i’m just curious what are the other kind of tailwinds and headwinds as you look forward jeffrey sanfilippo as for tailwinds we do have some little bit over the last  months so that we’ll start shipping in q as we see some positive impact on volume growth and with those new customers i think our sales and marketing team are doing a great job expanding distribution with our fisher recipe and orchard valley harvest brands as we expect some tailwinds going into fiscal ‘ with new distribution and new customers there the headwinds again we’ve got the short week for q and then just some of the volatility in cashew prices as mike mentioned we’ll see some severe increases coming down the pike in the very near future from commodity standpoint but from a gross standpoint and volume we’re laserfocused on that we realized we’ve got some more work to do but we’re optimistic on what we’ve got in place right now going forward operator operator instructions and our next question comes from mitch pinheiro with wunderlich securities your line is open go ahead please mitch pinheiro i was trying to figure out you said total nut when jeffrey when you were giving the iri data total nut volume was flat in the period that was the category correct jeffrey sanfilippo correct yes top line mitch pinheiro can you talk about the category in general maybe  first of all you are seeing ecommerce amazon and the like are they taking any share out of your conventional channels and do you participate in these channels at all jeffrey sanfilippo and so we do see  it’s hard to measure exactly what’s shifting from typical bricks and mortar retail to ecommerce but we do believe and have seen some shipments in consumer consumption that are shifting to ecommerce we are focused on ecommerce channel as part of our expanding consumer reach and our alternative strategic growth initiative so we are looking at ecommerce and working with several players now in that channel and we do anticipate in the future more consumption being done online mitch pinheiro is there  and anything else with the category itself i mean nuts haven’t lost their healthy luster is there something  for flat volume is there anything else happening that you could call out jeffrey sanfilippo howard you want to say anything specific since you’ve got little good perspective on general dynamics or consumption dynamics howard brandeisky all we see is snack nut category was down about  we already talked a little bit about the recipe nut category was down  the produce  as we measure it the produce part of the store actually grew the most had the strongest performance in our third quarter and that was driven by the drop in prices that we’ve seen in pistachio and so we saw a big surge in pistachio volume and in the category that is and so that resulted in the overall flat sales for the category mike valentine howard can you also talk a little bit about the recipe nut category that was down about  in quarterly comparison howard brandeisky yes so the category as you mentioned is down  and very different by nut type the walnut prices that we’ve already talked about came down so we did see a little bit of growth in walnuts of  but it was offset by the pecans and the almonds pecans have gone up about i think  in prices at retail on average and so we saw  drop and the almonds went down  in the recipe nut category but if you look at almonds overall they were up  as i think jeffrey maybe mentioned in his commentary we see  and we see this every quarter some rotating between the different parts of the store and in the case of almonds we saw some strength in the produce section of the store and the snack section of the store as people rotated out of the recipe nut section as overall almonds were up but in recipe nuts they were down as we measure it mitch pinheiro okay that was helpful and then i guess my final question just on gross margin you’ve done a terrific job improving on such a sales decline having an increasing gross profit it’s terrific performance the thing  i’d love to understand like what part of that is sustainable i mean as you look over the next couple of quarters i mean clearly you’re moving to  you’re focused on highermargin channels your higher margin customers is that sustainable or is there some items in the quarter that sort of helped i mean you’ve done it all year long that’s not just in this quarter but what  can you talk a little bit about that that would be helpful jeffrey sanfilippo you want to cover that mike or i was thinking mike valentine go ahead… jeffrey sanfilippo okay so as we shift our focus from the industrial business which was typically low margin we shift from some of the lower margin consumer business into more branded and value added product type that’s sustainable margin enhancement because we control the pricing we control our brands we control the spending against our brands we control indiscernible as you see our bands grow that is sustainable margin impact as long as we’re not seeing huge shifts or fluctuations in commodity prices we’ve got much better control over that margin going forward operator and at this time i’m showing no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to mr mike valentine

me today is jeffrey sanfilippo our chief executive officer and jasper sanfilippo jr our president and chief operating officer we may make some forwardlooking statements today these statements are based on our current expectations and they involve certain risks and uncertainties the factors that could negatively impact results are explained in the various sec filings that we have made including forms k and q we encourage you to refer to these filings to learn more about the risks and uncertainties that are inherent in our business starting with the income statement net sales for second quarter of fiscal  decreased  to  million in comparison to net sales for second quarter of fiscal  of  million the decrease in net sales was primary attributable to significantly lower selling prices for almonds and walnuts sales volume declined by  due to decrease in sales volume in the commercial ingredients distribution channel the sales volume decline in the commercial ingredients channel resulted from the loss of a common butter customer and lower sales of farmer stock peanuts to other peanut shellers and bought inshell walnuts to international customers due to the fact that we were not carrying excess inventories of farmer stock peanuts and inshell walnuts as it was case last year sales volume increased in the packaging and distribution channel from increase sales of peanuts and trail mixes to existing customer sales volume increased in the consumer distribution channel primarily from increased sales of our fisher recipe nuts and orchard valley harvest branded products while sales volume for private brand products was relatively unchanged fisher recipe nuts volume increased by  primarily due to introduction of a larger package size for walnuts distribution gains with new customers and increased promotional activity fisher nut volume declines by  due to decrease display opportunities and lower promotional activity primarily as retailers do not report market dealer to iri a  increase  a  increase in combined sales volume for orchard valley harvest and sunshine country produce products also contributed to sales volume increase in the consumer distribution channel the increase in sales volume for our produce brands resulted from a  increase in sales volume for orchard valley harvest brand due to new item introductions the ovh sales volume increase was partially offset by a decline in sales volume for sunshine country produce products due to some loss distribution and existing customer net sales for the first two quarters of the current year decreased to  million from  million for the first two quarters of fiscal  the decline in net sales and a yeartodate comparison was also attributable primarily to significant lower selling prices for almonds and walnuts partially offsetting these lower selling prices was a  increase in sales volume sales volume increased in the consumer distribution channel from increase sales of fisher recipe nuts private brand snack nuts and orchard valley harvest produce products sales volume increased in the contract packaging distribution channel primarily for the same reasons i previously noted in the quarterly comparison sales volume declined in the commercial ingredients distribution channel also for same reasons i cited in the quarterly comparison second quarter gross profit decreased by  million and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to  for the second quarter fiscal  from  for the second quarter fiscal  the decrease in gross profit dollars was mainly due to decreased sales volume the increase in gross profit margin primarily resulted from lower commodity acquisition costs for almonds which was partially offset by higher commodity acquisition costs for pecans and cashews gross profit for the first two quarters of the current year increased by  million while gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to  from  for the first two quarters of fiscal  the increases in gross profit and gross profit margin in the yeartodate comparison primarily resulted from lower commodity acquisition costs for almonds and increased sales volume total operating expenses for the current second quarter increased to  net sales from  for the second quarter of  total operating expenses for the current yeartodate period increased to  of net sales from  for the first two quarters of fiscal  the increase in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in both the quarter and yeartodate comparisons were mainly due to a lower net sales base total operating expenses decreased by  in the quarterly comparison and  in the yeartodate comparison decrease in compensation and advertising expenses were primary drivers for dollar decrease in total operating expenses interest expense for the current second quarter was  compared to  for the second quarter of fiscal  interest expense for the first two quarters of the current year decreased to  million from  million for the first two quarters of fiscal  the decrease in interest expense in both comparisons was attributable primarily to lower debt levels income tax expense in the quarterly comparison favorably impacted but the company’s application of a recently adopted accounting standard relating to sharebased compensation awards that vested during the current second quarter now moving on to inventory total value of inventories on hand at the end of the second  at the end of the current second quarter decreased by  million or  compared to total inventory value at the end of the second quarter of fiscal  the decrease in total value of inventories on hand was primarily driven by lower costs of finished goods which resulted from lower acquisition costs for walnuts and almonds the weighted average cost per pound of raw nut and dried fruit input stocks on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal  increased by  compared to the weighted average cost per pound at the end of second quarter of fiscal  the increase in the weighted average cost per pound of raw nut and dried fruit input stocks was mainly due to higher acquisition costs for pecans and cashews which were offset in part by declines in walnut almond and peanut acquisition costs finally our board of directors recently adopted a dividend policy under which it intends to pay an annual cash dividend on common and class a stock the annual dividend would be declared around the conclusion of our fiscal year and paid in the first quarter we expect the dividend could be paid in the first quarter fiscal  will be at least  per share i will now turn the call over to jeffrey sanfilippo our ceo provides addition comments and our operating results for the second quarter of fiscal  jeffrey sanfilippo thank you franc good morning everyone coming up the strong momentum from our first quarter of fiscal ‘ net income and diluted earnings per share reached record levels for any second fiscal quarter for the company this is the fifth consecutive year the company has reported record second quarter operating results for net income and diluted earnings per share in addition to this as franc just mentioned were pleased to announce our dividend policy we believe to acknowledge the time to begin the practice of paying an annual dividend to our stockholders this dividend policy advances our goals of creating longterm stockholder value and expanding our stockholder base and is supported by our strong financial performance the board will also continue to consider the declaration of special dividends around the time of each annual meeting of stockholders just as we did this past year in november q at the annual stockholders meeting the board of directors declared a special cash dividend of  per share on all issued and outstanding shares of common stock and class a common stock of the company a special dividend was paid on december   to stockholders of record at the close of business on november   this would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our management team and every one of our employees i thank them for their hard work leadership and supports we continue to execute our strategic plans to grow jbss brands expand consumer reach and provide bestinclass integrated nut solutions for key partners we also remained focused on operational efficiencies to reduce costs and add production capabilities throughout our manufacturing and supply chain i will talk about changes in the core strategy to expand consumer reach and pursue alternative customer channels we are making progress as we begin to execute our plans we were successful in expanding jbss’ snack brand into a major homeimprovement retailer in addition our food service chain is having initial success in expanding our distribution with noncommercial customers we defined in the noncommercial customer as a location that sells food where food is not their primary business this will include organizations such as colleges or universities cafeterias healthcare institutions and corporate industry as we continue to make progress i will highlight our activities on future calls turning to our sales review by jbss channel net sales in the consumer distribution channel decreased by  in dollars and increased  in sales volume in the second quarter of fiscal  the sales volume increase was driven by increased sales of our branded products the increase in sales volume for our produce brands resulted from a  increase in sales volume for our orchard valley harvest brand due to new item introductions which was partially offset by a decline in sales volume for sunshine country produce products due to lost distribution net sales in the commercial ingredients distribution channel decreased by  in dollars and  in sales volume in the second quarter of fiscal  sales volume decreased for the quarter franc mentioned was primarily due to lower sales of peanuts to other peanut shellers a loss of an almond butter customer and decreased sales of bulk inshell walnuts to international customers we’ve talked about optimizing our sales focus and here is a great example of how we shifted some of our volume to other channels where we are able to enhance our margins and improved inventory positions we successfully replaced the lost sales volume in the industrial segment of our commercial ingredient channel with strong volume growth for our branded and contract packaging products in the contract packaging channel we saw  again saw meaningful sales volume growth due to the efforts we made in assisting customers as they launched new peanut and trail mix products and gain new distribution net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel increased by  in dollars and  in sales volume in the second quarter of fiscal  the sales volume increase for the quarter was primarily due to increased sales as i mentioned on a lot of trail mixes and peanuts to existing customers turning now to category updates for our second quarter of fiscal  as always the market information ill be referring to is iri reported data and today it is for the period ending december   when i refer to q im referring to the  weeks ending december th references to changes in volume or price are versus the corresponding period oneyear ago we look at the category and iris total us definition which includes food drug mass walmart military and other outlets when we discuss pricing we’ll refer to average price per pound breakup of the recipe snack and produce nut categories are based on our custom definitions developed in conjunction with iri the term velocity refers to the sales per point of distribution first let me review some category dynamics the total nut category increased in pound volume by  and declined in dollar sales by  in q overall prices at the macro level declined  versus year ago now i will talk about each category in a little more depth starting with recipe nuts in q the recipe nut category struggled declining  in dollars sales and  in pound sales walnut pound sales were up  driven by  decline in weighted average walnut prices versus the prior year but the walnut pound sales increase was offset by pecans and almonds pecan pound sales decline  driven by a  increase in average prices versus the prior year and almond pound sales declined  despite a  decrease in average prices consumers appear to have migrated to the snack or produce section of the store for almonds as almond pound consumption in both these sections increased versus last year our fisher brand had a very strong quarter and continues to gain momentum behind our integrated marketing efforts fisher recipe nuts increased  in dollars sales and  in pound sales in the quarter versus last year as a result fisher pound share in the category increased  points versus last year fisher recipe continues as a leading branded recipe nut with an overall share of  which is    share points ahead of our nearest branded competitor the growth was driven by an increase in distribution of  percentage points of acv as our sales team continues to translate our retail success into greater retail penetration distribution for fisher recipe nuts is now at  acv in addition to the distribution gains pound velocity increased  the velocity growth was driven by strong merchandising performance at new and existing customers and the effectiveness of our brand no preservatives and nongmo messaging our continued brand equity efforts on fisher coupled with our distribution gains helped the brand overcome category weakness and deliver growth in q now let me turn to the snack category in q the snack category decreased  in dollar sales and was flat in pound sales versus last year and weighted average prices decreased  driven by declines in almonds of  and in peanuts of  fisher snack increased by  in sales dollars and  in pound sales as measured by iri in q the increase was driven by new distribution and an increase in pound velocity of  as measured by iri fisher sales volume however declined  overall due to declines at noniri customers orchard valley harvest business had a strong q quarter increasing  in dollar sales and  in pound sales orchard valley harvest grew faster than the category which was up roughly  in pound resulting in threetenths of a point increase in pound share our acv distribution has increased to  nationally and our velocity increased  by strong merchandising efforts we have continued to build on this success by launching new products such as our omega mix and a dark  and dark chocolate covered fruits both in multipacks sunshine country our other brand in the produce section of the store did not perform as well as orchard valley harvest the brand declined  in dollars and  in pound sales the brand declined in sales as we were overlapping aggressive merchandising last year at the key customer our total produce business orchard valley harvest and sunshine country grew  in pounds in the second quarter compared to a year ago in closing we have seen record increase as an acquisition cost recently for pecans in the  crop year which falls into our current fiscal  year and we also have seen significant increases in cashew acquisition costs the almond and walnut market prices have start getting stronger with higher demand for walnuts globally and almonds internationally so we will be taking price increases in q while we face competitive challenges every year that impact our company we have proven our ability to manage through volatile markets and we have volume challenges and headwinds going into the remaining back half of fiscal ’ but the management team remains focused on consistent execution of our corporate goals to create customer and shareholder value our resources are devoted to three specific areas expansion of national distribution of our fisher and orchard valley harvest branded products expansion of our customer reach by entering new distribution channels launching differentiated products and investing in new businesses and continue valueadded growth of nonbranded business with our key customers we appreciate your participate in the call and thank you for your interest in our company i will now turn the call back over to franc and since mike is out of the office today if you have questions after the call please contact franc at area code  thank you franc pellegrino thanks jeff we will now open the call to questions vicky please queue up the first question questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from francesco pellegrino with sidoti and company your line is now open francesco pellegrino good morning guys jasper sanfilippo jeffrey sanfilippo hi franc francesco pellegrino so first off the special dividend it seems there has been something in the works for quite some time now congrats on that but just want to hear your thought process behind it why we are sorting out with a modest dividend just in the first quarter as compared to maybe spreading it out evenly amongst all four quarters and maybe where the dividend can go going forward and also if you will still be considering special dividend as well sure francesco this is jeffrey so we have talked about a dividend policy over the last couple years actually something i have focused on and i wanted to do for a long time obviously our financial performance has been extremely strong and it always us to put a policy in place the  minimum that we’ve talked about was something that we felt comfortable with putting out there initially we will be considering special dividends throughout the year as well just as we have done in the last couple years usually announced our stockholders meeting in  at the end of the year francesco pellegrino okay so the look you guys are reporting record results it seems like quarter after quarter after quarter is there right now certain loss that the company could incur while still maintaining this  dividend if you incur  million loss lets say next year let’s say in  would you still be able to support the dividend going forward in the first quarter of  for example jasper sanfilippo we don’t anticipate losing  million anytime soon but based on our availability we believe that no that’s stable for awhile francesco pellegrino okay so regardless of the volatility in earnings you guys will be able to just consistently payout this dividend it sounds like given just how modest it is jasper sanfilippo we believe so jeffrey sanfilippo no it’s a francisco we really focus on managing that volatility i think we have proven that over the last couple years we are not the same company we were even three years ago with our focus on building our branded business adding value at key customers and now expanding our consumer reach so i don’t anticipate we are going to have a huge fluctuation in commodity impact that weve seen in past years that’s why we are confident in establishing the dividend policy today francesco pellegrino without a doubt and you guys have done a phenomenal job of just growing out your brand which has almost created like this nice branded mode around the commodities that you ultimately buy and then sell i just want to move over to volume so i guess when it looks given my expectations for the quarters just where nut prices are going and that we would get a little bit more turnover in the quarter but when i think about some of the elevated volume sales that you had in the what was it the commercial ingredients line that you sort of have done a really great job of sort of telling us hey probably you are going to be there in q whether it would be almond butter or it was the inshell walnuts sales or it was peanut sales to other peanut processors i get why volume was going to be up next but is there would maybe quantify what that volume was in the year ago period jasper sanfilippo for those three items those three items slightly represented over  million pounds for the quarter francesco pellegrino so they represented over  million pound essentially if we strip that out from the year ago period volumes are basically up jeffrey sanfilippo yes jasper sanfilippo and the volumes are up on our fisher brand which is the part of our business we are focusing on combined fisher brand volume was i think up approximately  quarteroverquarter francesco pellegrino okay im sorry what was that start again jasper sanfilippo our volume is up on in the fisher brand business and the consumer channel i believe volume is up around  for total fisher which includes recipe and snack francesco pellegrino okay i noticed in the first you guys also give us a volume performance against the consolidated brand as well as private label noticed that sort of what’s there in the q release anyway to get that if you have it handy jasper sanfilippo it’s in the press release the private label is flat for the quarter francesco pellegrino okay and branded was… jasper sanfilippo total brand is approximately  francesco pellegrino okay so based upon some of the things that i may able to back into i see branded revenue up  branded volumes up  so thats pretty nice but then i see private label revenue down  make sense it’s lower selling prices would have thought you would have got a little bit more turnover i see that you did address why volume was flat yearoveryear with what im thinking it probably maybe a single large customer is flat volume just maybe a concern in q or can we expect the volumes to sort of rebound in q and q for this private label business jeffrey sanfilippo this is jeffrey francisco so there were some dynamic that we had no control over some of the things that some of our key retail partners did with their shelf allocation and some of the category management decisions they made that had negative impact on their private brand volume we anticipate that they are going to make some positive changes going into our q and q to turn that volume around francesco pellegrino okay contract packaging when i just think about that distribution channel i see you guys have new distribution looks like new additional volume from trial mix and peanut sales is this with a single customer a single  one of your bigger customers or is it sort of spread out just be a greater distribution amongst the collective host of customers jasper sanfilippo yeah francisco this is jasper i would say that it’s kind of mix of a small handful of contract manufacturing customers currently equally francesco pellegrino okay looking at the fisher snack i saw that was down almost fisher snack down fisher snack nuts were down  on volume is it the timing thing with the promotional spend jeffrey sanfilippo yeah part of its timing part of it you saw we are seeing retailers look at cleaner lower policies where they are not putting as much distribution on the floor during q so which reduces some of the merchandising opportunities that we have the prior year so little bit of is changing merchandising strategy at the retail level but some that is also timing we anticipate to make some that up francesco pellegrino okay i got a couple more questions but i am willing to come back in queue if anyone has anything jeffrey sanfilippo thanks francisco jasper sanfilippo thank you operator operator instructions and we do have a followup from francesco pellegrino with sidoti and company your line is now open francesco pellegrino okay i am back so let’s talk about sunshine country for a minute right now is sunshine country is the volume base for that brand larger than ovh jasper sanfilippo no its not francesco pellegrino okay it’s not whats happening with that brand and to be honest with you when i think about produce a large part of the conversation has really been around the stellar performance of ovh and i don’t say sunshine country has been a neglected brand but i would just think that i dont know if theres distribution problems or maybe theres more excitement around ovh thats where the focus is is there retrenchment strategy that maybe happening behind the scene with sunshine country that allows you to maybe focus more on building the brand equity within ovh something is happening and im just wondering if maybe that brand might be having some problems behind the scenes jeffrey sanfilippo sure just to clarify orchard valley harvest is our premium produce brand it is  the positioning is after the health and wellness consumer sunshine country is a control we consider a control brand it is our lower and product mix lower price point it’s really with one key retailer at this point if that key retailer changes some other dynamics from a shelf allocation standpoint that’s where you are seeing such an impact on sunshine country brand it is funny that we are still focus on there are still a great opportunity for lower price point brands in the produce category something that our sales and marketing team is working on to look beyond the current customer that has  that takes sunshine country and expand that distribution because there is an opportunity to grow that brand as well francesco pellegrino okay with pecan market so it doesnt sound like if theres any like really supply issues and i think i actually saw that the pecan yield or the total harvest is going to be up slightly and it  ive heard that there was like the irrational pecan buyer out there that sort of causing pecan prices to remain elevated and continue to run and im just wondering since you are vertically integrated for pecan are you being maybe a little bit less aggressive now in your purchasing habits and potentially seeing lower prices later on in the year im just wondering where this market is going and what’s the rationale behind prices continuing to be at this level jeffrey sanfilippo francisco this is jeffrey so lot of dynamics happening in the pecan industry first of all the supply this year was at average level something there was last year and really for the last subsequent years we have not had a major increase in the pecan supply for quite a long time so while the supply has been fairly stagnant demand is continue to grow especially in china we anticipate china will import close to  million pounds of pecans this year and so part of this is supply standpoint being stagnant demand is growing internationally so that is one piece that’s driving reasons for increases second one there has been dynamic changes within the buyers for sheller of pecans there has been some consolidation in the industry private equity has invested in a couple pecan shellers recently so we got more cash available to buy the pecan crop and we did see some what we would consider unrealistic purchasing habits by some of these new entrants in the marketplace so it has driven the inshell supplier the demand don’t remain strong and so the meat market has remained relatively strong as a result francesco pellegrino okay and final question for me so in the first quarter you were lapping first quarter from q ‘ where volume was flat setting you up like a nice volume opportunity to beat in q ’ which you did with   with the  increase in volume we just lapped the really difficult quarter from the year ago period unless you had  volume growth now we got volume down  but i guess when we look at some of the earlier questions that i had you had some elevated lower margin business that’s really not in  going forward in the second half of  and i know you guys dont give guidance on volume sales but should we be thinking about in regards to this tough comp that’s going to be happening in the second half jasper sanfilippo the volume for the second half again we had a very good comp last year we have to in order to meet that comp we have to make up this right way this almond butter business and please remember last year in q we had an extra week so this year we don’t  this year we don’t have that extra week so it’s even more difficult to meet last year’s volume jeffrey sanfilippo on that i would add francisco the sales and marketing team are very focused on volume growth they’ve done a great job margining up the business and really focus on building the brands we are keenly aware that we need to look at the new distribution the new strategy of expanding consumer reach is going to be critical to go after new volume growth so we have a lot of headwinds going into the back half with the loss of that major industrial almond butter customer the categories are down if you the recipe nut category is down overall domestically and there are couple other headwinds from a consumption standpoint domestically that we need to overcome but we are  that’s why it’s so important that we expand our consumer reach getting to new customers and new channels and really focus on developing new innovative products for our key partners francesco pellegrino but when you talk about these headwinds and i guess what we saw with what happened to the overall volume number this quarter you guys could have lacked to down volumes sales and still be producing recordable  maybe not recordable eps in the third quarter but maybe record eps in the fourth quarter because you guys have really reduced your selling expense and administrative expenses in  as compared to the year ago period so are we just getting maybe the right product mix or is there too many different dynamics occurring on a quarterly basis that its really hard extrapolate these trends going forward jasper sanfilippo there is a lot of dynamics happened once if you recall we are  we have streamlined some of our sga expenses and we do have a better price mix now since we don’t have that lower margin industrial customer any longer so we do expect margins to improve going forward again there is a lot of mix volume and pricing awesome play francesco pellegrino okay perfect thanks again jeffrey sanfilippo thanks francisco operator and our next question comes from the line of stefan mykytiuk with ack asset management your line is now open stefan mykytiuk hi good morning jeffrey sanfilippo good morning stefan stefan mykytiuk so just following up on a little bit on what francisco was asking and jeffrey you alluded to this earlier but going back  years or  years this is a very different company i think you said before even three four years ago this is a very different company so you lost you shed  million pounds of what i would expect is low margin business this quarter and it sounds like we will have some continued flow through of that certainly from the almond butter in the next couple quarters but the history of this company seems to be that youre moving your mix you are bidding but you have done that over the last  years at times and then recapture that volume through higher valueadded either branded or private label or contract packaging business so is this the  million pound this quarter is this part of that whole kind of game plan to keep moving the valueadded mix up and continue to improve the complexity of this business jeffrey sanfilippo that’s correct stefan that’s exactly what we are doing we are shifting a lot as i mentioned the shift from our inshell walnuts internationally into more domestic shelled branded products and is an example of that the almond butter in the industrial chattel making up that volume we are really focusing our efforts on the branded piece of it and also our key partners that we provide their private brands for there is lot of growth opportunities with them as well so some strange industry dynamics happened this past two quarters really we anticipate that they are going to be refocusing their efforts on the snack nut category to turn that volume around yes we have shifted the volume from that lower margin industrial business and in some cases some of the international business to more profit business here franc pellegrino and also this is franc that’s also through the consumer channel back couple years ago our private label consumer channel was probably low in the branded piece of our consumer channels ph probably  low  and this quarter we picked that  so we are shifting from private label to branded just part of strategy stefan mykytiuk that’s  franc pellegrino of the consumer channel stefan mykytiuk of the consumer franc pellegrino yeah stefan mykytiuk got it got it so as i look over the next few years is it fair to assume we should expect or your game plan is to resume volume growth of overtime and then as you improve the mix that we should see improving margins in the business franc pellegrino absolutely stefan mykytiuk okay terrific thanks very much jeffrey sanfilippo thank you operator and i am showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to mr franc pellegrino for closing remarks franc pellegrino again thank you for your interest in jbss this concludes our call for our second quarter fiscal  operating results operator ladies and
