soonshiong is expanding his medical empire is that good for patients skip to content newsletters my account settings log out hospitalsexpanding his medical empire is good for patrick soonshiong but is it good for patients by rebecca robbins rebeccadrobbins july   twitter facebook linkedin email doximity republish print molly ferguson for stat twitter facebook linkedin email doximity republish print h e’s spent years pushing to revolutionize health care developing software systems for hospitals a new genetic test for patients and a slew of experimental cancer drugs now biotech billionaire dr patrick soonshiong can run reallife experiments to test his vision one of his foundations last year took control of a nonprofit hospital in pennsylvania and one of his businesses this summer took over six more in california last week he also opened a new cancer center in el segundo calif down the street from los angeles international airport he has made clear that he views his new medical facilities as laboratories for his approach and his products that’s likely to be good for soonshiong the key question is it also good for patients advertisement take his new el segundo cancer center he appears to be planning to use his pricey diagnostic test gps cancer routinely there that would help one of his companies which has struggled to sell the test nationally it’s less clear whether patients will benefit there’s no published data showing if this test works better than — or even as well as — any comparable tool on the market his team has also laid out plans to enroll virtually every patient at his cancer center in clinical trials but the only two trials listed on the center’s website are testing highly experimental therapies being developed through soonshiong’s forprofit businesses another wrinkle the three doctors running the clinic are also employed by soonshiong’s companies — the very companies that are selling the diagnostic and developing the drugs they will consider using on patients this isn’t how drug development normally works indeed soonshiong’s arrangement stands out as highly unusual most drug companies don’t have their own employees setting up medical clinics to treat patients with therapies that are still being investigated instead they undertake a painstaking process of introducing their experimental drugs to physicianresearchers across the country and seeking permission to set up trial sites at independent hospitals asked if soonshiong’s companies will have more traditional clinical trial sites elsewhere his spokeswoman didn’t answer read more he vowed to cure cancer but this billionaire’s moonshot is falling far short of the hype the spokeswoman jen hodson told stat that there should be no concern about any of the arrangements saying that soonshiong always puts patients first but ethics experts say there’s a clear potential for multiple conflicts of interest as he moves aggressively into patient care for instance the small rural nonprofit hospital in pennsylvania that’s controlled by soonshiong’s foundation agreed last year to pay  million over three years to license software marketed by one of soonshiong’s companies nanthealth the hospital wouldn’t say whether there was a competitive bidding process neither would soonshiong’s team ‘there are no conflicts’ when stat first sent hodson questions about how soonshiong’s team is handling the potential conflicts she responded quickly with a brief email “there are no conflicts” a few days later after more questions hodson directed stat to a conflict of interest policy for the el segundo clinic it requires the staff to disclose their financial ties to soonshiong’s businesses when they’re enrolling patients in clinical trials of soonshiong’s drugs it also says independent third parties will monitor the trials “we are well aware of the issues you raise have been proactively and well advised by third parties and taken the appropriate steps to address them” hodson said responding to some of stat’s questions in another email hodson said it was “false” to suggest that the medical facilities might be improperly swayed toward using soonshiong’s products “dr soonshiong always puts the best interest of the patient first his decisions are and have always been guided by what is in the patients’ best interest” she said read more ‘it will help us with our product’ emails show how a billionaire’s philanthropy boosted his business on one of the issues stat raised in its questions soonshiong has changed course one of his companies nantworks now owns a majority stake in the management company operating the six nonprofit hospitals in california a press release jointly issued two weeks ago by nantworks and the hospital chain said that soonshiong would take a seat on the chain’s board of directors that raised some concern among medical ethics experts consulted by stat they noted that the board of directors is generally meant to be an independent advocate for the hospitals’ patients and mission — a body that can challenge the management company when needed having soonshiong sit on that board and also control the management company would be atypical in the world of nonprofit hospitals said james orlikoff a consultant who helps hospitals steer clear of conflicts of interest “from a good governance perspective it’s questionable at best” orlikoff said following questions from stat hodson said soonshiong’s plans had changed and he would no longer take a seat on the board outside experts see ethical land mines at stat’s request half a dozen experts in fields like hospital governance and medical ethics agreed to review publicly available information about soonshiong’s expanding business interests in patient care all of them said they saw potential ethical land mines “there needs to be some clarity and transparency about what these relationships actually are” said dr bernard lo an internist and president of the greenwall foundation which funds bioethics research without that information lo said “you don’t know whether decisions are being made under undue influence and not in the best interests of the patient” the arrangements could spur the “use of services that are not medically indicated” said dr steven joffe a pediatric oncologist who studies medical ethics at the university of pennsylvania he said he’s also concerned that the nonprofit hospitals could be pressed into “choosing a service provider that is not the best andor the least expensive” questions about conflicts of interest have swirled around soonshiong before stat reported earlier this year that soonshiong’s big moonshot initiative to cure cancer has become an elaborate marketing vehicle for his gps cancer diagnostic tool another stat investigation found that a donation from soonshiong to the university of utah brought him commercial benefit and politico has reported on other ways that soonshiong’s philanthropy has advanced his business interests sign up to our daily recap newsletter please enter a valid email address to be sure soonshiong is far from alone in blending business interests with patient care and such arrangements offer potential benefit if patients can get access to cuttingedge therapies and technologies that might not otherwise be available to them but studies show that such arrangements can also push patients toward expensive and unneeded treatments for example when men with prostate cancer get referred to a clinic where their urologist has a financial stake they’re much more likely to get an expensive treatment known as intensitymodulated radiation therapy even though it doesn’t work any better than cheaper alternatives a  study found other studies have shown that physicians with financial interests in laboratories tend to order more tests concern over such conflicts prompted congress to enact a federal statute known as the stark law first passed in  and amended over the years it bars physicians from sending patients covered by medicaid or medicare to undergo certain services at clinics where the doctor has a financial interest there are many exceptions to the stark law and it’s unclear from available information whether soonshiong’s new ventures could be in violation said joan krause a law professor at the university of north carolina questions arise at a small hospital in pennsylvania soonshiong’s first foray into the business of patient care came last year when he took control of a small hospital in the tiny town of windber in southwestern pennsylvania and it’s there that some of the potential conflicts of interests identified by stat have already surfaced opened by a coal mining company more than a century ago the hospital is in the heart of mining country — unusual territory for a cosmopolitan billionaire from los angeles but the hospital is affiliated with a research institute and it held a treasure that reportedly caught soonshiong’s eye a repository storing tens of thousands of tissue and blood samples from patients with breast cancer and other conditions access to such samples could help soonshiong develop diagnostic products as well as further his team’s research into cancer therapies he soon came to see the local hospital which has about  beds and employs about  people as a showcase for his bigger ideas about reforming health care delivery read more how the world’s richest doctor gave away millions — then steered the cash back to his company in  the windber hospital’s board agreed to transfer control to soonshiong’s nanthealth foundation the pennsylvania attorney general’s office approved the transaction at the start of  soonshiong’s foundation now financially backs and controls the hospital it does not control the research institute windber medical center was soon renamed the chan soonshiong medical center at windber — after soonshiong and his wife the former television actress michele chan it didn’t take long for soonshiong to start integrating windber into his empire the hospital’s ceo was quoted in the press release soonshiong’s team put out in january  saying that windber’s tissue bank “will be utilized as the tissue repository resource to support” the clinical trial program soonshiong was launching as part of his new cancer moonshot initiative also in the first year the windber hospital placed a threeyear order for “softwareasaservice solutions” marketed by soonshiong’s company nanthealth the cost  a year plus a onetime fee of  according to an april filing with the securities and exchange commission it’s impossible to tell how much similar software from competitors would cost for a hospital of that size because the sec filing didn’t specify exactly what was purchased if the deal — which represented just a small chunk of nanthealth’s  million in reported revenue last year from that category of software — was made after a competitive bidding process and a review by hospital staffers it certainly could be ethically sound said lo the internist and bioethics expert but it’s unclear whether that happened neither hodson nor the windber hospital would say how the decision was made the hospital’s spokeswoman natalie bombatch referred nearly all of stat’s questions to soonshiong’s team hodson offered only a general statement that transactions between the windber hospital and soonshiong’s companies “will be reviewed and approved by disinterested directors and officers in accordance with their respective conflict of interest policies” “dr soonshiong always puts the best interest of the patient first” jen hodson spokeswoman for soonshiong control of the windber hospital has also opened a new market for another one of soonshiong’s products gps cancer which recommends treatments based on the genetics of a patient’s cancer it’s not clear how many patients at windber have taken the gps cancer test but at least one patient told the local newspaper the tribunedemocrat that she got it last fall — at a time when there were few other takers for the test which analysts estimate costs about  stat reached out to several oncologists at the windber hospital seeking to talk about whether soonshiong’s control affected clinical practice the only one who responded said she wasn’t in a position to comment read more soonshiong rails against ‘false reporting’ as he announces lackluster sales soonshiong’s team touts gps cancer as backed by clinical evidence but there are no published data comparing it in headtohead trials with other diagnostic tools and in part because the test has only been on the market for about a year there are no published studies showing whether it extends patients’ lives in one study that soonshiong’s team has touted indiana university researchers looked at  patients who took the gps cancer test and found that  percent of them got clinically useful information — though just  percent of that smaller group actually received a therapy matched to their tumor genetics the study did not look at whether the test’s unique qualities — it analyzes protein expression as well carrying out more runofthemill genetic sequencing — yielded any actionable information above and beyond what patients could have gotten from cheaper genetic tests on the market the indiana researchers presented the study this spring as a poster at the big annual gathering of the american society of clinical oncology and are now preparing it for publication using hospitals for the poor as ‘an experiment at scale’ soonshiong didn’t hold back earlier this month when describing his plans for the investment that gave him control of the six california hospitals that make up the nonprofit chain known as verity health “i’ve spent the last decade of my life quietly building this infrastructure” he told the los angeles times he owns a stake in the newspaper’s parent company “this hospital system will provide an experiment at scale” those words raised alarm bells for dr jeff smith the executive of santa clara county which is home to two of the verity hospitals that like the rest of the chain mostly serve lowincome patients “if dr soonshiong is focused on entrepreneurship and profitability and high intervention experimental procedures there’s no way that that can be done at these two hospitals without basically tossing the poor people out of the queue” said smith who trained as a family practitioner his county unsuccessfully tried to buy the two hospitals a few years ago the verity hospitals are not now using products made by soonshiong’s companies according to hodson soonshiong has pledged to invest in the hospitals and expand cancer care as well as orthopedic and cardiology services he doesn’t like referring to verity facilities as “safety net hospitals” he said at an event broadcast online last week pledging to ensure that the lowincome patients have “as much care and state of the art care as if they came from beverly hills” read more meet trump’s wouldbe health czar a billionaire with a brash vision a bodyguard — and a divisive record asked how verity is handling the potential conflicts of interest associated with soonshiong’s investment the hospital chain’s spokeswoman jane brust initially referred all questions to soonshiong’s team later brust said the chain has policies in place “to allow our board of directors and management to identify and evaluate potential conflicts of interest” she didn’t respond to stat’s questions about what those policies entail and how they might be applied in this case given that the management company making decisions is owned by soonshiong promising treatment so new it hasn’t even been tested in humans ever the showman soonshiong has set skyhigh expectations for his new cancer clinic in el segundo he’s said that los angeles lacks a worldclass cancer center and suggested that his new facility will change that and at a ribboncutting ceremony last week soonshiong pronounced the new center “the american red cross of cancer” — a reference to his claim that his team can grow an unlimited supply of “natural killer” cells to build the experimental therapies he’s now testing for one formulation of the natural killer cell therapy soonshiong promised his crowd “the firstinhuman studies will be done right here” it’s not clear who owns the private clinic which is named for soonshiong and his wife hodson said last month that soonshiong is not the owner soonshiong has said on twitter that he’s a codirector he’s also the only member of the center’s board of trustees listed on its website read more soonshiong’s top executive steps down at nanthealth the three other doctors running the center are all employees of various soonshiong businesses codirectors dr john lee and dr leonard sender both work for nantkwest which is developing the natural killer cell therapy dr sandeep reddy also holds down a job as nanthealth’s chief medical officer overseeing clinical trials for gps cancer the cancer center’s conflict of interest policy which hodson said has been in place “from the outset” allows clinical investigators to have disclosed financial interests with medical companies “only if it furthers and enhances” the cancer center’s mission the policy also states that clinical trials will be monitored by independent third parties — a clinical research organization and a data and safety review board those are routine features of clinical trials lo the internist and bioethics expert reviewed the policy at stat’s request and said it lacks several crucial components that would “considerably strengthen it and provide greater assurance that conflicts of interest are being appropriately managed” it doesn’t for example say who will review financial disclosures to determine if further steps need to be taken nor does it say whether clinical trial protocols will be peer reviewed by other scientists beyond the necessary stamps of approval from the food and drug administration and institutional review board “there needs to be some clarity and transparency about what these relationships actually are” dr bernard lo bioethicist though soonshiong has suggested the center will be a worldclass facility it’s unclear whether it will offer any routine treatments such as chemotherapy radiation or surgery hodson did not answer stat’s questions about the center’s services sender one of the cancer center’s codirectors told the local newspaper the daily breeze that his goal is to get close to  percent of patients enrolled in clinical trials that raises a big question of how the clinic plans to make money it’s uncommon and widely considered unethical to charge patients to participate in clinical trials hodson would not answer questions about the clinic’s business model another question whether the center will send patients to big hospitals such as the academic medical centers in los angeles to get access to a broad range of trials or whether the doctors will focus on enrolling patients just in the two trials listed on the clinic’s website — both of which are sponsored by soonshiong’s companies to test their experimental drugs read more who’s the billionaire doctor palling around with donald trump one of those trials is a phase  study of natural killer cell therapy it will test whether the therapy is safe in patients with advanced solid tumors the second trial will test combination therapies involving experimental vaccines in patients with pancreatic cancer that has progressed despite firstline treatment it will start out testing the safety of the combination therapy and then evolve into testing whether it works one of the vaccines being used in the trial has shown encouraging early results in patients with advanced colorectal cancer another vaccine in  failed a midstage trial where it was combined with a type of chemotherapy and used in pancreatic cancer patients the center’s website doesn’t explicitly mention soonshiong’s gps cancer but it suggests that the product will be central to treatment decisions the center’s philosophy after all is to make “molecularly informed decisions” by analyzing both the genetics and the expressed proteins of a tumor that’s exactly how gps cancer is marketed the website seems to suggest that the test might be used multiple times in a single patient to track “spatiotemporal tumor evolution” and to direct treatment decisions and a recent press release trumpeting plans for the pancreatic cancer trial stated that gps cancer will be used to “molecularly inform” the combination therapy’s design which will also involve approved chemotherapies natural killer cells and another experimental compound whether patients considering seeking care at soonshiong’s cancer center will understand the highly experimental nature of the drugs being tested is not clear this past march soonshiong repeatedly retweeted a video put out by one of his companies that described his natural killer therapy this way “new breakthrough helps patients kill cancer” the video appeared to violate federal regulations barring the promotion of drugs that haven’t yet been approved by the fda after stat raised questions about the video it was taken down from social media and reedited multiple times to tone down the banner headline and delete suggestions that the therapy had cured at least one patient more recently soonshiong retweeted his new cancer center’s pledge to deliver “unique natural killer cell and immunologically based treatment to our patients” he and the center also turned to twitter to circulate a link to a tv news story about the center’s opening from the local cbs affiliate above a chyron referencing “killer cells” the reporter proclaims that “this state of the art institute” is “the only place in the us” to use this new approach to fighting cancer not mentioned the approach is nowhere near being approved by the fda twitter facebook

givingpledge to give away majority of his wealth suddenly turn into a con artist at age of  this guys is controversial no doubt partly because he is a selfmade man and he doesn’t seem to give a damn about what other people think httpswwwforbescomsitesmatthewherpermedicinesmanhattanprojectcantheworldsrichestdoctorfixhealthcareceacf he could have asked u of utah to name  buildings with his name for his donation but instead he asks u of utah to try out his product that will benefit their patients gray area but is it because he wants to make extra couple bucks or does he really believe that his product will one day cure cancer he is also probably not the first philanthropist or foundation who’s “selfdealing” the soonshiong bashing  articles on stat seems excessive maybe there is alternative motive as the other commenter pointed out we call guys like elon musk he wants to colonize space visionaries but soonshiong as “showman” because he claims curing cancer is possible watching his interviews he sounded quite down to earth to me anyway let’s hope he finds that algorithm reply the question should be asked where rebecca is getting this information from she has no investigative journalism experience and very little journalism experience and is being fed this information from sources simply trying to malign soon shiong the likely candidates are tronc where he is fighting a nasty battle for control and short sellers who have made large profits on the declining price of nantkwest and nanthealth in the era of email hacks the integrity of a writer who is being fed stolen emails and cherrypicks snippets of information should be questioned but honestly i have to thank her as i am buying shares of nantkwest on the cheap and will continue to do so so thanks rebecca for being so naive i wonder if this comment will stay up on the site or if stat will pull it down since they really dont care about the integrity of their journalism reply not stolen if the emails came from someone who received them which is how this happened in the days before hackers people who had either had concerns about the university and its association with nanthealth or investors concerned they are being sold a false narrative if i may use a trumpian term tina – her article cites emails circulated at the university and nanthealth if she got internal emails from nanthealth then someone has violated their confidentiality agreement but the real interesting point is that she got emails from both sources this points to an email hack not a single internal source and for someone to put that effort into it there is usually a financial incentive but honestly if that single quote “it will help our product” is the only quote they could find to implicate soon shiong in wrongdoing then she has absolutely nothing will any real news outlet cover this i doubt it nanthealth’s response with emails from the physicians demonstrated that rebecca ignores any facts that contradict her story i

advanced health speaks at the newseum in washington october   photo by gary cameronreuters for weeks biotech billionaire dr patrick soonshiong has been taking to social media to portray himself as a valiant warrior against cancer unfairly maligned by the press he and his diagnostics company nanthealth have strenuously denied reports that they reaped benefits from a  million gift he made to support medical research at the university of utah but emails and documents obtained by stat make clear that executives at nanthealth and officials at the university viewed the deal through a transactional lens intended at least in part to boost soonshiong’s commercial interests the deal with utah — which gave soonshiong’s team access to genetic and health data on hundreds of patients — “will help us with our product” larry fitzgerald a nanthealth vice president wrote in an email stat reported last month that the university sent  million of soonshiong’s  million gift right back to nanthealth to pay for genetic sequencing of blood tissue and tumor samples soonshiong a showy entrepreneur who has vowed to “solve cancer” denied that the contract had been set up to funnel money to his company or that he had benefited from the arrangement but those denials are contradicted by more than a dozen documents stat obtained from critics of the deal including email chains and internal memos that circulated at the university and at nanthealth as the deal was being planned and executed they show that the plan to steer business back to soonshiong and give him access to patient data to improve his product was baked into the deal from early on among the findings a university memorandum from september  days before the donation was made official stipulates that the genetic analysis to be paid for by soonshiong’s gift would be done by soonshiong’s team another document circulated within the university noted that one of soonshiong’s companies would for a time keep copies of the patient data involved in the sequencing job — and would use it to develop its “sequencing and bioinformatics platform” internal emails from nanthealth executives also indicated that they explicitly saw the deal as a means to boost their business though the deal was built around the idea that soonshiong’s lab would do the genetic sequencing the company was not yet prepared to do that work when the contract was signed emails show at least one nanthealth executive was scrambling to try to delay the university from visiting the lab because the company had not yet formally confirmed that its new dna sequencing machines were working properly the documents offer new details about the way soonshiong’s philanthropic and business interests intertwine they deepen ethical and legal questions surrounding his donation to the university of utah and they raise new questions about why the university agreed to accept a gift on the understanding that it would send most of the money back to the donor’s company — especially when that company wasn’t yet ready to do the work read next soonshiong’s promotion of ‘breakthrough’ cancer therapy raises questions nanthealth spokeswoman jen hodson said the documents in no way proved that the deal was structured to send money back to soonshiong’s company even though they repeatedly show early evidence of plans to do just that hodson said the university was free to pay any qualified company to do the sequencing — though the university told its own scientists early on that “a bioinformatics team associated with the donor” would be doing the work that memo was dated four and a half months before the university inked its research contract with nanthealth hodson also denied that soonshiong reaped gains from the deal and said his companies did the work for utah at a loss “there was no commercial benefit” she wrote in response to stat’s questions “however there was a significant benefit to the learning system of mankind” she referred to a recent paper about earlyonset menopause that came out of the scientific research funded by soonshiong’s donation both hodson and university of utah spokeswoman julie kiefer said that nanthealth was transparent with the university that it was still getting its genetic sequencing machines ready for prime time though the emails stat reviewed suggest that at least one executive was worried about how much they still had to do “i worked to put them off a bit to later in march—so not to disclose we still have work to do on the validation front of samples” nanthealth executive laura beggrow wrote to the company’s president in february of  referring to the university of utah team a defiant stance on social media soonshiong nanthealth’s majority owner and ceo has repeatedly used twitter in recent weeks to dismiss his critics and to suggest that they’re out to derail him as he pursues the noble goal of curing cancer nobody should be a target just because they want to help our country cancer affects all americans …red and blue httpstcolheiiehm — dr pat soonshiong drpatsoonshiong april   in his most recent tweets soonshiong blames the critical coverage on the fact that he met at least twice with president trump prior to the inauguration in january he was said to be in talks for a senior role in the administration overseeing the us health care system that buzz has since quieted politicostat attacks anyone who meets potus to serve usaimportant to give backthat’s why i am doing what i dohttpstcohmuyfhxwv — dr pat soonshiong drpatsoonshiong april   stat’s previous coverage of soonshiong included the finding that his ballyhooed moonshot initiative which aims to cure cancer by  achieved little scientific progress in its first year and instead became mostly a marketing tool for nanthealth’s pricey new diagnostic test called gps cancer the stat investigation of the utah deal found that the arrangement could put soonshiong and his foundations in violation of tax rules against indirect selfdealing since the publication of that investigation nanthealth’s stock price has sunk  percent to  per share and at least three investors have filed suit against soonshiong and nanthealth alleging violations of federal securities law a politico investigation last weekend found other examples of soonshiong’s charitable foundations operating in a way that benefited his business interests nanthealth lost  million last year the company reported last month ‘it will help us with our product’ in the days before soonshiong formalized his donation to the university of utah the university wrote up the terms in an informal memorandum of understanding dated early september  the memo circulated at the university said academics could participate in research funded by the donation so long as they agreed to various stipulations such as that genetic analysis would be carried out “by a bioinformatics team associated with the donor” the memo also says that “donoraffiliated scientists shall have the right to analyze the sequence data for any or all of the heritage k projects” which was the university’s umbrella term for the research funded by soonshiong’s donation the memo indicated soonshiong’s team would be able to keep that data for two years read next soonshiong made ‘implicit threat’ to spur investment in nanthealth media company says kiefer the university spokesperson said the memorandum did not commit the university to awarding the sequencing contract to nanthealth she previously told stat that the university looked around to see whether other facilities could meet the very detailed specifications in soonshiong’s gift contract but none of them could — except nanthealth and its associated lab nantomics the deal gave nanthealth access to lots of valuable data associated with the hundreds of samples it sequenced and analyzed for utah scientists the company learned which diseases ran in each patient’s family whether they were affected by certain medical conditions and how closely they were related to other people who provided samples for analysis the patients’ identities were not disclosed the contract prohibited soonshiong’s team from using the data for purposes beyond the work it had been contracted to do but it did allow a crucial exception the owner of any algorithm could retain all improvements made to the algorithm in the course of performing the job that was a boon for soonshiong’s business because the algorithms that sift through large quantities of genetic data to identify patterns for researchers also power his commercial products like his gps cancer diagnostic tool he was also working on developing a second product gps heritage meant to assess a patient’s risk of inherited and rare diseases soonshiong has denied that the utah deal had anything to do with the development of gps heritage but a company statement to investors belies that assertion it explicitly says that the deal with university of utah “will enable the development” of the new gps heritage product and the emails reviewed by stat show that at least two top nanthealth employees saw the deal through a commercial lens “i know this research project is taking place with nantomics and more to refine our algorithms it will help us with our product” fitzgerald the nanthealth vice president wrote in an email dated in april  and sent to colleagues “larry is correct” responded beggrow the company’s chief commercial officer hodson told stat that in fact “the algorithms themselves were not affected or improved by the addition of these data” in the earlier email to nanthealth’s president about the research project beggrow had suggested there was room for soonshiong’s team to achieve even greater commercial gain though she provided few specifics “i believe we all need to work collectively with effective communication throughout all of our nant families” she wrote in february  “and to optimize these opportunities for upselling along the way” both fitzgerald and beggrow have since left nanthealth and are both now employed at a different biotech company neither returned stat’s repeated requests for comment on their emails ‘the ethics are messy’ another university of utah document circulated in december  underscored the point that that soonshiong’s team planned to use the research data for commercial gain “nantomics will retain the data and dna sequence for development of their sequencing and bioinformatics platform” the document reads that document gave academics suggestions on revising their research protocols so as to allow soonshiong’s team access to the patient data read next he vowed to cure cancer but this billionaire’s moonshot is falling far short of the hype it’s common for scientists to ask their institutional review board to approve changes to their research protocol midway through a study they must generally do so for instance any time they want to interrogate a new question but two experts who study institutional review boards and reviewed the university of utah documents at stat’s request saw potential ethical land mines in the deal karen maschke of the hastings center said it raised questions about what patients were originally told would happen to their samples when they agreed to provide them did they know for instance that their genetic and health data might be shared with a forprofit business jennifer miller founder of the nonprofit bioethics international said that while the deal seemed to pose minimal privacy risks to patients “the optics are bad and the ethics are messy” a lab not yet ready to carry out its work not long before the university of utah deal was signed soonshiong’s team bought a new brand of sequencing machine called the hiseq x and sold by illumina when a lab buys new machines it can’t just start performing work for clients right away there’s an involved process of developing new protocols ensuring they work robustly and then validating the performance of machines with a formal test according to heidi rehm medical director of the clinical sequencing research platform at the broad institute of mit and harvard soonshiong’s team wasn’t using its machines to commercially diagnose patients at that point — they were just for research — so the validation wasn’t as complex but it likely still would have involved running benchmarked samples through a starttofinish process to ensure the machines were sequencing the dna properly rehm said beggrow’s february  email indicates that nantomics was at that time not yet ready to do the sequencing for utah even though the university had been planning for at least five months to have soonshiong’s team do the work the nantomics lab “hasn’t yet even begun to do validation work on samples” beggrow wrote she added that she “did not want to disclose this to this account at the university of utah that we aren’t ready to accept their actual  retro samples” kiefer said the university knew “that this was a new state of the art facility and that the new equipment would require validation testing” she added that the university did not start paying nanthealth “until it had been verified that the sequencing met the high standards documented in the contract” hodson said that “nothing was hidden from the university of utah” the validation work beggrow mentions in her email hodson said “refers specifically to the university’s demand that nantomics validate the accuracy and quality of the sequencing data against the university of utah’s own work with other external vendors by performing analyses of test samples” when it came to delaying the university of utah’s lab visit hodson said “this timing was openly communicated by nantomics to the university scientists and it may be that nanthealth and nantomics employee were not communicating the timely information back to one another” this article is reproduced with permission from stat it was first published on

science look if you look upon chronic diseases as an epidemic and you see that the chronically ill are the poor then you see that this issue of the uninsured is not really a moral but a financial obligation to change health care patrick soonshiong change health financial there is no right or wrong way of giving people in los angeles have made major contributions in different ways to the city eli broad to art david geffen to hospitals im not judgmental patrick soonshiong art city giving the idea would be in my mind  and i know it sounds strange  is that the most important advances in medicine would be made not by new knowledge in molecular biology because thats exceeding what we can even use itll be made by mathematicians physicists computer scientists figuring out a way to get all that information together patrick soonshiong knowledge together mind yes id is a machine vision and sensor browser for the physical world thats what we have been working on with cocacola verizon bank of america and disney to launch content when an image is recognised patrick soonshiong vision world america i am convinced that in order for you as a patient to be protected it has to be transparent evidencebased objective information not selfserving information not pharmadriven information not addriven information it is transparent objective evidencebased information patrick soonshiong i am information you youd believe that a patient with hypertension if you know you have hypertension or diabetes you would take your drug every day the compliance rate is more like  or

patient patrick soonshiong science medical doctor we need to and must protect privacy but i think that people will be willing and even eager to share medical information about themselves for the greater good of mankind patrick soonshiong good medical information in south africa being chinese meant i wasnt white and i wasnt black i trained in baragwanath hospital the largest black hospital in south africa that was around  the time of the soweto uprising when police fired on children and students who were protesting i was part of the group of interns who volunteered to treat them patrick soonshiong time children black i think of la as truly the melting pot its basically a minicountry unto itself patrick soonshiong think itself pot its unconscionable that cancer patients get the wrong diagnosis  percent of the time and that it takes so long to treat them with appropriate drugs for their cancer patrick soonshiong time treat long my commitment is to los angeles so whatever helps this continue to be a great city thats what i would be focused to do and the dodgers are certainly iconic to los angeles patrick soonshiong great commitment city it took  years from abraxane being conceived to us showing now with conclusiveness that it works in pancreatic cancer we cannot afford as a society to wait another  years to make sure that the patients get the right care at the right time at the right place patrick soonshiong time society care what we discovered counterintuitively is that when you start killing a cancer cell one of the things it does in order to survive is to spread even further it causes itself to form new blood vessels weve termed this reactionary angiogenesis patrick soonshiong start you blood were really going after truly creating sustainability of a diseasefree state creating a complete system for managing cancer patients for life so that you can manage from onset of disease all the way through patrick soonshiong life you sustainability you dont inherit cancer you actually get it patrick soonshiong you cancer inherit it was really an easy decision for me to be a part of the lakers its priceless it is one of the few places where i truly get
