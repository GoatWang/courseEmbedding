gap has made deliberate moves towards a radically different retail strategy by drew hendricks drew hendricks is a tech social media and environmental addict hes written for many major publications such as forbes and entrepreneur drewahendricks contributor inccomdrewahendricks write a comment credit shutterstock images not long ago gap and its related retailers were among the most popular destinations for backtoschool shoppers with apparel and accessory options at various price points for all age groups the classic brand once enjoyed spiked sales and soaring profits during the late summer and early fallhowever gaps most recent sales numbers appear to show a shift away from its favored status in the hearts and wallets of shoppers although the company aggressively advertised and discounted throughout backtoschool season sales remained stagnant the lone bright spot during the month was the positive momentum gained by its old navy storesrecent changes to gap incs retail strategy are raising the question of whether the brand is making the right choices to remain competitive could its august sales slump be an indicator of more bad news to comewhat has been changing at gap inc the companys multipronged approach shows several deviations from its previous approach includingexpansion in asia the growing apparel markets in the east have attracted the retailer which is set to open  stores in india and  in china over the next year rising incomes and massive populations in the region make it an area of enormous potential for gap and its related lifestyle brandsacquisition of new brands shoppers have been familiar with gap brands banana republic and old navy for years but the company has continued to acquire new online and virtual brands such as piperlime athleta and intermix this has diversified its offerings as well as its target audiencesfewer brick and mortars in  gap closed the doors to  of its stores in the united states at the time the retailer cited higher efficiency and profit margins as the objective for its store closingsonline sales focus at the same time gap has been placing a greater emphasis on sales through gapcom which also conveniently links to its other brands for a seamless and allencompassing shopping experience for its brand enthusiasts although these tactics have met with varying levels of success their impact on the brands longterm growth and global reputation will continue to unfold over the next several years this will certainly serve as a lesson to its competitors as they formulate their global strategies both virtually and online how balancing physical  virtual locations helps companies when companies like gap operate brick and mortar retail establishments in addition to ecommerce websites the balancing act between the two can be a challenge however when businesses achieve this it yields a number of benefits to the corporation and its customers alike includingpersonal connections the ability to walk into a store try on clothes and talk with retail associates is something many shoppers value when too few physical stores remain within an individuals area he or she may choose companies with a stronger brick and mortar presencetouch points brands that meet their customers wherever they are stand the best chance of remaining competitive in a multidimensional economy those unlikely to visit a mall or shopping center may be more apt to make a purchase from an online retailer while online advertising and sales efforts may be lost on those preferring a more traditional shopping experiencepurchasing options online and instore shopping each present their own advantages and disadvantages which may apply to the same shoppers at different times during the same day month or week someone who needs a new outfit the next day cant afford to wait for a purchase to ship whereas someone with a busy work schedule may be unable to walk into a store during its business hours in addition an online purchase remains impossible for those seeking to pay with cashwhen providing online and instore shopping options one of the most important components of the retail experience is the point of sale a business offering a wide range of payment options and making the process as quick and uncomplicated as possible will enjoy the highest numbers of converted and returning customersone way to achieve this is by utilizing highquality pointofsale systems businesses of all sizes can accept a wide range of payment types with new mobile payment options such as square and paypal which attach directly to ones mobile device and allow them to complete transactions anywhere they travel for online businesses comprehensive pos systems such as shopify make completing purchases an attractive prospect for customersfor gap and other retailers combining brick and mortar and ecommerce locations it is crucial to make every aspect of the customers experience more convenient enjoyable and memorable with a balanced versatile and streamlined approach to business brands of all sizes can achieve sustained growth in their chosen marketsdo you think gap incs recent business strategies

making clothes people actually want to wear art peck a nineyear gap inc veteran looks forward to being “out there in the messy mosh pit of change” by danielle sackslong readdefeat it turns out smells a lot like cinnamon rolls on a saturday afternoon in january the cheapcaloried aroma of cinnabon permeates new jersey’s twostory livingston mall distracting visitors from an increasingly visible realityadvertisementthe yearold shopping center’s fleet of modest stores—so familiar and accessible to customers for more than a generation—are turning into a liabilitybetween a lackluster sears on one end of the mall and a macy’s on the other four naked mannequins and an empty metal rolling hanger are all that remain in the fresh graveyard of wet seal the teen retailer that recently announced it’s shuttering twothirds of its stores “one day they’re remodeling the next day it’s closed” mutters the teenager working the cellphone repair cart outside the store across the way at an aeropostale kids’ shop an everything must go sign hangs in the window “we’re closing tuesday” explains the girl at the register sipping a smoothie while assembling a piece puzzle “they’re going online” next door is a large empty storefront freshly vacated by a toys “r” us while at the other end of the corridor teen retailer delia’s which recently announced liquidation flaunts its own going out of business sign “once malls like the livingston mall lose competitive edge in a market they can’t compete” says dj busch mall analyst for green street advisors who predicts that  of lower to midtier malls will disappear over the next decade “once you lose a good tenant others will follow retail works that way—you follow the mob” advertisement four miles away at the mall at short hills tony brands like bur­berry calypso st barth and chanel draw shoppers from all over the state “malls are the story of the haves and havenots” says busch who believes that destinations like short hills will continue to thrive ecommerce has devoured lowerend malls but “customers still want to try on touch and feel highend apparel” he adds “as goes middle america so goes the middleamerican mall” says wendy liebmann ceo of wsl strategic retail the result is the latest wave of retail darwinism the classic american shopping emporiums that put downtown main streets out of business in the s are now themselves on their way to extinctionall of this has been weighing on art peck who has just become ceo of the company arguably most synonymous with malls gap inc which also owns old navy and banana republic “gap was founded in  when malls were being built real estate was coming available and consumer shopping patterns were being trained” says peck a slim yearold who was dressed in a hooded black leather rag  bone bomber jacket when i first met him in december two months before he started his new job “gap essentially rode the wave of that initial change in retail that mall building boom that took place for  or  years” the brand enjoyed a year reign over classically cool affordable american style but it has spent the past decadeplus struggling with an identity crisis while new retailers have colonized much of its domain the iconic brand slept through the fastfashion revolution fueled by the likes of european labels hm and zara got lost amid competitors such as uniqlo and target who offered basics and denim at higher and lower price points overexpanded and became too ubiquitous for today’s nicheminded fashion crowd “we used to talk about the ‘gapification of america’ that notion of one size fits all” says wsl’s liebmann “that’s just not a proposition relevant to america now” between  and  sales dropped every year at gap’s north american stores since  store sales have continued to suffer gapquest  things you should know about gap’s new ceo why when it comes to retail the pants always wear the pants the denim empire see the history of gap in  minutes into this reality rides a former consultant turned digital believer with perhaps an impossible task to make the onceiconic business relevant again it is a task echoed throughout our economy—at brands like yahoo and mtv jcpenney and buick peck has spent the past nine years moving up through a variety of roles at the  billion apparel conglomerate which includes newcomers athleta and intermix he is convinced that the company’s future will depend not just on delivering better product but on radical experimentation gap thrived in the heyday of the mall—what peck calls retail —and floundered in the fastfashion wave he calls retail  gap’s hope he explains is to leapfrog ahead to win in the retail  era a mobilefueled future in which physical stores will have an entirely new role “we’ve been doing business the same way for  years and there are very few yearold business models that are successful forever” peck says “periods of disruption are periods of disproportionate opportunity” he continues laying the stakes “more money is made during disruptive times—but is also lost—than is made during times of stability” so what will that store of tomorrow deliver and how soon before gap rolls it out near you peck props his foot on his knee gripping his lower leg with both hands like an oar predicting what form that store will take is the puzzle he’s trying to solveif there’s one item of clothing that both inspires and haunts peck it’s colored denim he refers to the colored denim period often in conversation as if drifting back to memories of an old summer fling bold punches of greens yellows fuchsias and aquas in the form of skinny cropped and brokenin jeans and khakis it represented a rare moment in the company’s recent history february  to be exact when the gap brand was ahead of a fashion trend yet true to its heritage—casual american optimistic peck was running the north american arm of the gap at the time and he gambled big letting stores run dry on other inventory in advance “then we flowed the product” he recalls “i kept looking at my head merchant asking ‘where are the numbers’ day one day two day three four six seven—then boom it hit and the comps went through the roof” it was the brand’s bestselling line in yearsadvertisement distressed denim ceo art peck inherits a company with stagnating store sales—but bright digital prospects peck’s office at gap hq in san francisco looks more like a designer’s den than an executive suite evoking the confidence and whimsy of the colored denim period there’s no desk a series of hacked barbie dolls a “family art project” he explains referring to his wife and four kids—two of whom work for old navy line the windowsill a decou­paged dress form topped by a soldier’s vietnam war helmet “worn by a guy who apparently in the boredom of fighting a war had a hot glue gun and glued pistol cartridges to it” stands in the corner and a tattered mustardyellow rough road sign leans in the corner “it’s irony” the walls of the conference room next door are checkerboarded with another art project  mini–david hockney replicas painted by peck and his tech leadership team as a creative exercise “there was a fair amount of wine flowing” he admitsif there’s one item of clothing that both inspires and haunts peck it’s colored denim although there’s retail in peck’s blood—a distant relative helped found woolworth’s back in  and his grandfather helped grow it globally—he didn’t find his way into the field until his late forties after graduating from harvard business school he spent  years at the boston consulting group advising executives at large industrial technology and entertainment companies and working for the likes of universal music when digital filesharing services such as napster started to emerge “i can remember executives arguing that a customer will never not want their music in physical form there was a lot of denial” peck recalls “i’ve seen this again and again—by the time change has happened around a company they panic and reflexively react to it it’s oftentimes too late to be out there in the messy mosh pit of change with unclear direction and unclear implications that’s much more important”peck jumped into the mosh pit in  after gap’s then–ceo paul pressler hired bcg to help identify growth opportunities—and ended up bringing peck inhouse to lead the company’s strategy and corporate development “the most important things in my life have been unexpected unplanned forks in the road” says peck who met his wife on a blind date he worked with bob fisher son of gap founder don fisher and then the non–executive chairman of the board to cut costs—which included shutting down experiments such as forth  towne a failed attempt to grab the over set peck also suggested that the company accelerate international growth by franchising to local operators instead of relying on wholly owned stores “we would surely not be as global as we are today were it not for art” says eric severson gap’s svp of talent who has worked closely with peck for yearspeck has spent his time at gap steadily hopping from one area to another always with good results he’s overseen operations and global logistics led the acquisitions of activewear brand athleta and upscale women’s fashion retailer intermix and ran gap’s profitable outlet business his first experience managing a plin  the company’s next ceo glenn murphy appointed peck president of gap north america which had suffered years of falling sales “what most leaders do is spend all this time analyzing diagnosing and then building a huge plan that you unveil” says severson “art is much more firmly rooted in get in and start doing” peck had one priority fix the product much of the problem he concluded stemmed from a fractured creative team—from design to merchandising to marketing “the store felt one way the service felt another way the product felt another way and the marketing was another way” says severson “it was cognitive dissonance” peck fired gap’s highprofile head of design patrick robinson and camped out in gap’s new york design center one weekend he hotboxed all the top leaders in a room until they came to a consensus on a cohesive look the gambit worked the clothing created during peck’s two years as head of the gap brand led to eight straight positive quarters including the colored denim period its best run in years—all without a head of designpeck’s nearterm priority as ceo is once again to fix the product on a brisk january day he stands at the mouth of gap’s flagship store in midtown manhattan “i’m glad to see yellow because color has been lacking in the assortment but it’s not the most democratic color” he observes he’s digesting the latest merchandise with jeff kirwan who has spent the past four years building gap inc’s china presence and whom peck just put in charge of the gap brand only one week into his new job kirwan can see the challenges ahead “we’ve stuck with some old historical winners that have started to fall off the cliff we’ve held on to them too long” says kirwan pointing to a pile of skinny jeans that don’t have enough stretch in them adds peck “the trend in denim right now is the destructive and destroyed denim and our washes are clean we missed a little bit of the trend” then peck wanders over to a table of cashmere sweaters and picks up a heather grey one “it’s a really nice cashmere but it’s a really tight crew neck that’s not a feminine neckline at all” he says disappointed “my guess is i could buy this in a large and wear it”advertisement a tight spot gap founded in  pioneered the idea of casual affordable cool today competitors encroach from every direction—and these are just the ones with actual physical stores gap challenge stuck in the middle it’s been losing relevance as competition chips away from all sides strategy boost design materials and production cycle to reestablish itself as an iconic brand old navy challenge the “basics” brand has gone too basic veering toward generic cheap clothing strategy make trends accessible at a low price point already showing signs of progress banana republic challenge has developed a staid and serious “dressing for work” reputation strategy give jcrew vet marissa webb freedom to steer the brand into more fashionforward territory her first line debuted in march androgynous cuts bland colors and missing trends completely have been just a few of the issues plaguing gap’s women’s collection since peck stepped away from daytoday management of the brand two years ago after he left the company hired a new creative director rebekka bay a danish trend forecaster and design consultant who cut her reputation launching hm’s more modern upscale cos brand bay tried to bring a fashionforward basics sensibility back to the brand but items like a tshirt dress ended up too minimalist and boxy for the gap customer one of her more daring touches this past season was reviving gap’s “crazy stripe” sweater from the mids which boasts a rainbow’s worth of colors while not referring specifically to that sweater peck commented to his staff “it’s a sign of the times unfortunately that when there was an ugly christmas sweater party at the company some of the sweaters there were from our current assortment that’s not the way it should be” by late january bay was outthe faster you are in conceiving product and putting it on the shelf the less risk there isat the manhattan flagship store peck directs my gaze away from the bustling “sale” section that appears to be a magnetic force for customers “we’re not going to allow you to go over there” he tells me only half teasing training customers to expect chronic discounts has become a destructive cycle at gap he knows that he has to “pull out the promo needle” as the industry puts it to do so gap needs to ramp up its retail  capability right now he says it takes the brand at least  months to get its new product ideas into stores that’s about three times as long as competitors like hm and zara which have built their success by hopping onto the fashion world’s hottest trends and riding them “we’re an industry that guesses a lot” says peck who is working with vendors across the entire supply chain to cut production time down to around  weeks “the faster you are in conceiving product and putting it on the shelf the less risk there is”if peck’s time as the head of the gap brand gave him a road map for attacking the company’s product woes it was his next job—the one he had just before he became ceo—that provided him with the skills for imagining retail  for two years peck headed the awkwardly named “gid” division for “growth innovation and digital” this was the group in charge of the company’s smaller highgrowth brands ecommerce and socalled omnichannel offerings—industry jargon for bridging digital and physical retail he introduced retail services such as “reserve in store” “find in store” and “ship from store” and digitized its entire product inventory peck didn’t have technical engineering skills but he pushed the group to infuse a sense of humanity into the company’s ecommerce products and he was never afraid to question things “if you looked at the way we presented ourselves on smartphones two years ago it was highly utilitarian big buttons gray prominent text” says sol goldfarb the company’s executive vp of digital and customer experience “art kept saying ‘it’s not good enough it’s not good enough you’re not there’ art taught us that choosing convenient and transactional versus emotional and engaging is a false dichotomy”art taught us that choosing convenient and transactional versus emotional and engaging is a false dichotomyfor years peck has focused on dissolving the wall between physical and digital during the two years he ran the gap brand peck shrank its us footprint by shuttering more than  locations “in malls where real estate wasn’t productive” he says now as ceo peck hints that the number and size of the company’s  stores will inevitably shrink he plans to make mobile the central point of all customer interactions—though he’s not exactly sure how “i would like to be able to articulate a nice linear path as to what our stores are going to evolve to” he says “but i think it’s going to be a lot messier than that” he’s testing showroom formats mobile registers rfid–tagged clothing interactive digital walls and even something that might resemble a vending machine peck has developers in silicon valley camped out at gap banana republic and old navy stores incorporating customer and salesperson feedback into code in real time “i think that kind of rapid prototyping—typical in a lot of other industries not so typical in ours—will be critical for figuring out this collision of physical and digital” he sayspeck’s enthusiasm in this area is one of the key reasons he was tapped to be ceo “as the board thought about the kinds of skills the new leader should have digital operations skills were pretty far up the list” says bob fisher “art was the unanimous choice” michael silverstein who ran bcg’s retail practice for  years was one of the people peck turned to in weighing the decision to accept silverstein advised him that it was a rare opportunity to reinvent retail at a moment filled with uncertainty—something peck was wired for advertisement “art’s running the company as if it’s a smaller company” says jyothi rao intermix’s new president whom peck recruited from gilt groupe where she ran its women’s and kids’ divisions rao recalls negotiating a critical new hire when the process hit a bump “we could have gone through two or three layers in our hr organization” says rao “but i just texted art and said ‘are you cool with this’ and he got back to me in less than one minute” nancy green a year gap inc vet who’s now running its fastgrowing athleta business says that peck understands how to cultivate entrepreneurs within a large organization “what art always says is ‘what do you need from me’ and i’ll say to him ‘i need you to remove that wall for me please’ he’s like ‘okay let’s figure it out’ ”advertisement new intermix president jyothi raophoto geordie wood for all the criticism gap has faced its digital competence has never been questioned “they’ve always been ahead of the curve” says sucharita mulpuru an ecommerce analyst at forrester the retailer builds almost all of its technology inhouse has been aggressive with services that straddle the physical and digital and boasts one of the most elegant digital interfaces for its  billion ecommerce business where most of the brand’s sales growth is coming from these days “gap is one of those brands that’s at an inflection point” says mulpuru “it will either go the way of jcpenney with its glory days behind it or do what jcrew has done have a massive retrenching and turn the business around”as peck works to remedy lapses in the company’s retail  proficiency and build a digital framework for retail  he’s simultaneously creating a bridge that will allow the company to move smoothly from one to the other that bridge odd as it may seem is fashion peck undoubtedly watched jcrew elevate its brand prestige by debuting collections on the runway and recently took a page from that playbook in february for the first time banana republic revealed its latest line at new york’s fashion week under new design chief marissa webbwebb is arguably now gap inc’s most fashionable employee on the snowy winter day when i visited she may have been the only woman in new york showing toe cleavage webb jcrew’s former head of women’s design is walking peck through a preview of her fall  collection bare skin exposed between her threeinch heels and cuffed navy wool trousers an independent thinker she represents a new type of dynamic peck hopes to have with creatives “every time he comes to town he wants to meet at my personal studio” says webb after leaving jcrew in  she launched an eponymous fashion line and had been running it for three years when gap inc came calling last spring banana republic was a staid brand trying to shake its workwear reputation then–ceo murphy sent peck in to meet with her “i was the closer” peck says with a grinfashion has the potential to bring some necessary buzz to the company remember when the first family wore jcrew to the inauguration but more important it offers gap inc two things it desperately needs in order for peck’s overall vision to succeed trend insights and credibility intermix which sells highpriced wares from designers like valentino and derek lam will give gap inc immediate access to fashion information and serve as a trend breeding ground for the company’s other brands so will peck’s relationship with emily current and meritt elliott the la duo behind currentelliott after they designed the boyfriend jean—a trend that rocked women’s wear in —peck reached out to them for lunch and they began a relationship that led to consulting work for the gap brand last year peck became a personal investor in their newly hatched brand the great peck says that his stake in the highend brand isn’t considered competitive with gap inc “he allows any creative person to feel free” says current the pair were recently named style ambassadors for old navy banana republic creative director marissa webb both rao and webb are tasked with channeling trend intelligence to other gap brandsphoto geordie wood then of course there’s webb in hiring her gap made an unprecedented financial investment in her namesake brand knowing that it could provide valuable early intelligence—and perspective “it’s the two extremes of the industry” says peck “ours is a big machine that sits in the corner every day and says ‘feed me’ and hers is this relatively small business where the pure essence of it is product nothing else—no politics no process i think it’s a healthy way to always remind us what job number one is” webb who now juggles both banana and her own line simultaneously says she’s found a likeminded partner in peck “it’s an honest relationship” she says “he calls it as he sees it and i respect that he’ll send me a text and i’ll send him a text back it’s very fast very scrappy”now once gap develops its fastfashion machinery it will know precisely how to deploy itadvertisementnone of this of course guarantees that gap will succeed as peck takes the helm old navy—now led by former executives from hm and nike—is on the upswing athleta in the booming “athleisure” space has the company’s fastest growth prospects along with gap inc’s asian expansion peck killed ecommerce experiment piperlime he removed bay and installed limited brands vet wendi goldman as gap’s first executive vice president of product design and development the pruning and buffing under way are always good practices and gap’s fasterfashion effort will be a smart investment no matter what—retail certainly isn’t slowing down plus there could be more acquisitions ahead some think the company should buy a retailer like uniqlo which still has yet to fully conquer north america but peck is more interested in smaller startup businesses that have a lot of growth ahead of them “i tend to get much more excited about those” he says still no one can answer that ultimate question of what a retail  store will look like no one knows advertisement for all the ground it lost with fast fashion gap might be in the best position to find out it’s already ahead of competitors like hm and zara when it comes to a digital and mobile presence if by generating desirable ontrend clothing and lots of good buzz gap can establish an emotional connection with consumers perhaps it can then lead them anywhere be it to a mall an app or a vending machine in december two months before officially becoming gap’s ceo peck held his final meeting with his gid team he riffed about “the wonderfully messy ugly disruptive time” that gap’s business was entering “the beginning of a shakeout” rippling across the apparel industry and his hope that his legacy as ceo will be that “we grabbed it wrestled it and we are killing it”the role of the store is evolvingthere’s a gap at new jersey’s livingston mall wedged between the surrendered wet seal and liquidating aeropostale kids’ store on an early january day an end of season sale sign hangs in the window next to mannequins dressed for the gym seven of the  shoppers inside rummage through the discounted merchandise there’s another gap one town over at the short hills mall where there’s also a banana republic webb’s fall  collection will arrive in august many customers will see it first—and shop from it—on their phones “the role of the store is evolving” says peck “what it’s going to become is something that we and the customers will figure out together over time” luckily when it comes to fashion customers
