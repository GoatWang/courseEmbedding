trading quarter is a familiar smell on wall street reuters reuters thursday july    am facebook tweet email a goldman sachs sign is seen on at the companys post on the floor of the new york stock exchange january   reutersbrendan mcdermid reuters reuters reuters thursday july    am by olivia oran reuters  big wall street banks have spent billions of dollars and untold manhours in recent years transforming their trading desks from hedgefund like operations trading on their own account into marketmaking businesses offering a price based on what customers want to buy or sell but the shift in business model prompted by reforms following the  financial crisis has done little to shield banks from suffering big losses when markets move against them traders and risk managers told reuters this week goldman sachs group inc’s secondquarter results which saw earnings rise to  per share from  in the same quarter last year also included the worst commodities trading quarter in its history as a public company prompting a  percent fall in the banks stock in the last two days bad inventory positions based on wrong expectations of customer demand were partly to blame chief financial officer marty chavez said in explaining the decline in trading revenue chavez compared the business to a store that needs to stock the right products on its shelves it must also be able to absorb what clients are selling and create new products they might want he said calling risk management in trading an art and science goldman is not alone in recent years banks including jpmorgan chase  co  citigroup inc  barclays plc and deutsche bank ag have all suffered losses from currency moves interest rate positions or misguided bond market bets its not always easy to find a ready buyer and seller of the exact same assets that youre looking for said clifford rossi a former risk manager at citigroup there may be timing issues – its like musical chairs and the market maker may end up holding whatever is left over under the socalled the volcker rule which was intended to limit proprietary trading banks are now required to prove they are only holding enough inventory to meet reasonably expected nearterm demand the rule was implemented in response to the  financial crisis when wall street banks fueled problems in the mortgage market by making speculative bets with their own money but one of the volcker rules unintended consequences has been to drain liquidity in certain markets which has made it more expensive and difficult for banks to source inventory for clients or manage their own risks new rules defining the amounts of capital banks must hold have made it more expensive for them to hold certain types of assets while a long period of low volatility in some markets has made it trickier to gauge when trading activity will suddenly rise unexpected gains in the swiss franc in early caused losses at citigroup and barclays reuters reported at the time last quarter deutsche bank lost  million on a wrongway inflation bet according to bloomberg jpmorgan lost billions of dollars on the notorious london whale trades related to credit default swaps in  in late goldman was burned by bad currency bets just a fluke in trying to prevent those kinds of losses banks have developed software algorithms to anticipate market directions put technology in place so that traders cannot breach risk limits hired more risk managers and empowered them to question decisions of dealers according to consulting firm opimas banks last year spent more than  billion globally on management and compliance systems and people but ultimately those investments may prove futile in situations like the one goldman faced last quarter when some commodity prices collapsed volatility in other markets was historically low and customer activity dropped off the unexpected trends led the banks own commodities research analysts to ask in a june  report how did we and the markets get it so wrong throwing more dollars and people on risk management doesnt necessarily mean there is less trading risk on wall street or that it is properly contained said mark williams a professor at boston universitys business school who focuses on risk management in banks goldman has long prided itself on the independence and power of its risk management staff who are known for questioning highflying traders without fear of retribution that helped goldman become one of the most profitable wall street banks while avoiding many of the pitfalls that beset rivals in the run up to the  financial crisis in march goldman gave its risk management team even more prominence by moving it into an independent unit some bank analysts are willing to give goldman a break given its track record its the nature of the business said oppenheimer analyst chris kotowski it becomes a problem if either it produces massive outsized losses that compromise capital ratios and imperil the company or they make a habit out of it its too early to say this is a habit rather than a fluke reporting by olivia oran in new york editing by lauren tara lacapra c copyright thomson reuters  click for restrictions tags

in all material respects the financial position of the wall street fund inc the fund at december   and the results of its operations for the year then ended the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these financial statements and financial highlights hereafter referred to as financial statements are the responsibility of the funds management our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits we conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the united states of america which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement an audit includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement

piece as follows we welcome a rational market moving in anticipation of reasonable fundamentals with the knowing assumption of risk as this will provide the best opportunity for realizing excellent gains over time for the full year the sp  rose  the dow jones added  the nasdaq composite added an amazing  and the russell  advanced  the market generally favored smaller to midsize companies with higher volatility this is a normal occurrence coming off the bottom after a severe bear market we are in a broad market advance in anticipation of continued economic progress on many fronts the more growthoriented companies are most likely to outperform indeed our search for the best values today is among companies with sustainable earnings acceleration our work indicates a narrow spread today between valuation levels for small mid and large cap names further suggesting that the winners will be determined by such fundamentals as earnings visibility cash flow and reinvestment rates more frequently found in the smaller and midsize companies than the large behemoths th at are still cutting employment we are increasingly hearing from managements of the companies that we research that this recovery is for real that it has power and sustainability we have enumerated the underlying reasons for this over the past year an accommodative fed government deficit spending the beneficial effect of tax cuts a more fairly priced not weaker dollar pentup demand notably for technology investment enhanced productivity from continuous costcutting and the constancy of the consumer supported by real income growth despite ongoing risks to our troops the recent capture of saddam hussein lends further confidence to this positive mix we have been and remain bullish on the economy the december ism purchasing managers index release shows incredible strength the index rose to  from  the last time that the index was over the  level was in the s some components of the index are remarkable considering from whence we came new orders at  paced production at  inventories actually fell as demand and backlog increased jobs are being created despite the media attention we note that recoveries are always jobless until confidence rises and hard evidence mounts that the recovery is real the fed appears committed to keeping rates low and stimulus ongoing and has repeated this in public pronouncements made by various fed governors monetary base growth is sustainable running at  year over year given that core inflation is extremely low the fed can probably keep the stimulus going at this meaningful level as the economy recovers and confirmation of economic strength becomes ever more visible there is going to be talk of inflation and talk of tightening which may have the similar effect as tightening itself it is possible to see the market itself raise interest rates in anticipation of a fed move so that the fed may actually follow the market yet this is likely some ways off as long as capacity utilization and employment are below historical norms the term weak is perhaps unduly pejorative when applied to the dollar in this case we believe that treasury secretary snow has grasped the fundamentals behind our trade balances and has done a great service to our export economy by allowing the dollar to be priced more fairly this action favors the core manufacturing sector we expect that exports may increase at a rate greater tan our domestic gdp growth with significant collateral implications for corporate profits and future employment the risks apart from another terrorist event include a surprise reemergence of inflation a more rapid uptick in interest rates perhaps an oil shock or worldwide health issues the major positive is the tremendous momentum built up as the year came to a close moreover we believe that the heightened state of readiness of our government military and even of our monetary authorities represents a positive factor going into an election year we see a bias towards the status quo in terms of economic policy the media will certainly grab any opportunity to make a headline out of changes in fortunes during the ongoing political campaign but based on current conditions we anticipate a reelection of the incumbents and continued economic progress through the first years of the next term the fragility of psychology remains high yet we truly believe that the fragility of the fundamentals is very low while we expect some heightened volatility in the coming months we believe that we are on a path towards generally higher equity prices across the broad spectrum of market capitalization for some time to come january   sincerely   robert p morsepresident             additional information
