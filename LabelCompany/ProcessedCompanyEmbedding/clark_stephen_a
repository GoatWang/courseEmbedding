sparacinoon october  format paperbackverified purchasespectacular is the first and last word that comes to mind in thinking about this gloriously told story while the opening pages come near to bogging down in seemingly endless detail about lewis and clarks preparation for their monumental voyage and the various supplies they laid in the trip itself is described in breathtakingly brilliant gripping prose no wonder history courses seldom receive high marks teachers are ill equipped to share the adrenaline soaring adventures of our many real life american heroes lewis and clark were us army commanders of the highest caliber they focused on their men and their nearly impossible mission in equal measure their bravery and intelligence under often horrific conditions cold wet blizzards not enough to eat sometimes hostile indians and on and on ultimately carried the day and lit one more candle or torch for their famous one of a kind leader and mentor president jefferson and our still new nationlewiss unraveling and acute illness when he assumed a political post after the expedition was over is heart breaking he became terribly ill ultimately committing suicide while still in his s and there didnt seem to be anyone available to help him or of course the sort of medications routinely available to modern day physicians despite his ignominious and terrible slide toward death by his own hand meriwether lewis stands with his great friend william clark as one of the best men our armed forces ever sawcomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport

undaunted courage  stephen ambrose almost makes the reader feel like shehe is there while all the decisions are being made and our congress of the day debates funding the trip as well as approving the funds for the louisiana purchase which they thought would be a bust congress some things dont change beyond that the summary of the trip preparation and the actual trip itself is fascinating how so few men could achieve what they did when they did it in an unknown land filled with dangerous marauding natives may be one of the single greatest american achievements ever kudos to stephen ambrose and kudos to thomas jefferson for insisting the lewis and clark sojourn take place this is a great read for anyone interested in substantive american history and the american spirit to accept and

the expedition itself than the early life of meriwether lewisthis book puts into perspective how difficult the trip was and how even with modern technology this trip wouldve still been difficult i learned a few things such as what a sextant is it was interesting to read lewiss descriptions of the native americans describing them as savages while also admiring them i think a lot of history books gloss over the expedition with only minor details it was interesting to learn of his fight against the blackfeet as well as the medical issues endured by the men via the weather and also medical conditions brought on by themselves through intercourse with native american womenwe also see a glimpse into the tight relationship between lewis and clark lewis was very much a scientist and reading about what wildlife he saw as the first american to do so was really cool with some locations ambrose frequently tells us around where the present day location is and being a google maps lover i would look it up it was fascinating to see places where i could visit myself that lewis and clark had visitedin all i can see myself coming back to this book to read againi wont spoil the ending for those who havent read it but it was also sad to read of the battle lewis had with alcoholism and malariacommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web

writtenbyandrew e hansonon june  format kindle editionverified purchasenormally im not one to read much nonfiction but my sister recommended that i read this book because it is among her favorite books i called her tonight after i finished reading chapter  genuinely distraught because i didnt know lewiss life ended in that way plus i was in awe by how eloquently that chapter was written describing what was possibly going through lewiss mind before his death thanks so much to my sister for the recommendation who recommends that i read clay jenkinson next and listen to his jefferson

bunch of tough dudesbymark d milleron july  format kindle editionverified purchaseif i could just rate the expedition i would give it  stars but i am also rating the book which brings it down to  the men of the expedition were nothing short of amazing the book however dragged in the beginning and the end i also didnt like how the author was apologetic for the views of lewis in regards to slaves woman and indians it was  dude and youre not lewis so dont apologize for him great to learn about the expedition but was almost a chore to finish the bookcommentwas this review helpful to

purchasethis is a wonderful travelogue of the lewis and clark expedition focusing on the life of meriwether lewis ambrose emphasizes the close friendship that lewis shared with both thomas jefferson and with william clark the book is a good history and for the most part ambrose stays away from politicizing the subject matter the first few chapters were a bit dry but once i got to lewis relationship with jefferson i found myself not wanting to put it downthe lewis and clark expedition was one of the great adventures of all times and is not something that will be duplicated on this planet we know now what lies around the next turn they were the ones who drew the map  and the details of how they took measurements and produced the map were given in a way that made sense to me a nonmathmatical thinker as often as he can ambrose allows lewis to tell his own story in his own words and what a wordsmith he really was his prose is beautiful i was truly sorry that his journals were as sparse as they were and that he never managed to get them edited and printed in his lifetimelewis story is truly tragic his whole life seemed to point to the expedition and when the trip was over he never really found his way again i have a much greater respect for life on the early frontier i have recommended this book to several others and had i not bought it on my kindle i would probably have it out on semi permanent loancommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address belowproduct not found only products offered on amazon

timeless story  well writtenbysteve dietrichvine voiceon january  format hardcoververified purchaseambrose brings the magic of the lewis  clark expedition alive with this magnificent booka great author can struggle with a pedestrian story and a great story be tarnished by an unskilled author however undaunted courage is the retelling of a classic story from the heart of america by a great author who also loves and lives the material there are so many ministories woven into the book that it helps to stimulate entertaining discussions of this historic accomplishmentthe book also brought to me a far greater appreciation of jeffersons great impact on art and science in the young republic while we think of thte expedition in terms of its impact on our political history it was equally important in gaining an understanding of the biological and geographical wonders of the uncharted wildernessit is a wonderful gift to young people to help them understand the foundation of our westward growth reads with the excitement of a novel and the enlightenment of good historyit is hard not to repeat the many good things said about this book other than to mention that if i were to be allowed only  books to take for a year of isolation this would be oneits easy but rewarding readinghighly recommended and a book thats filled a lot of christmas stockings and birthday packages in our

adventurebydennis michaelon august  format kindle editionverified purchasethis is an actual historical event that ambrose brings to life in the form of an adventure story its not a dry history lesson it starts a bit slow with the early lives of jefferson lewis and clark but becomes an adventure in the wildernessi think the most remarkable character is sakajawea their guide and interpreter she went on the trail pregnant gave birth in the field then carried the baby on her backanother remarkable aspect of the expedition is that for the entire treacherous journey only one man was lost this attests to the excellent leadership of lewis and clarkecommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address belowproduct not found only products

philosophical practiceby clark stephen r lthe thought of the roman philosopher plotinus c has been the object of perennial fascination for philosophers and laymen alike best known today for his doctrine of selftransformation through contemplation plotinus did not regard his originality as formulating new truths but rather as showing how to engage in spiritual exercises so as to live philosophicallynbsp taking a highly unconventional approach the distinguished philosopher stephen r l clark here gives us a book that is at once deeply penetrating and highly personal clark focuses on dimensions of plotinus that scholars have dismissed as irrelevant or merely ornamental  his images metaphors and myths he argues that we need to understand those dimensions in the cultural and philosophical context of his time if we are to understand what those exercises amount to and so to understand as it were from within where his philosophy leads clark shows how plotinus employs specific images drawn from the greek literary tradition for philosophical purposes images of knowledge like those of light or drunkenness or images of being itself in order to analyze and explore the realities of the divine intellect he also notes their momentous legacy in later thinkers in the muslim jewish and christian traditions the book aims to be both scholarly and open to psychotherapeutic discussions from within other philosophical and psychiatric traditions that acknowledge the role that stories myths and metaphors play in constructing the mindancient  classicalcondition hpb condition
