whitening systems how long do whitening effects last at home vs dentist supervised should you whiten your teeth risks associated with whitening whitening product safety choosing an overthecounter whitening kit there are many teeth whitening systems and products including whitening toothpastes overthecounter gels rinses strips trays and whitening products obtained from a dentist teeth whitening is ideal for people who have healthy unrestored teeth no fillings and gums individuals with yellow tones to their teeth respond best but this cosmetic procedure is not recommended for everyone find out if teeth whitening is right for you whitening systems whitening toothpastes all toothpastes help remove surface stains because they contain mild abrasives some whitening toothpastes contain gentle polishing or chemical agents that provide additional stain removal effectiveness whitening toothpastes can help remove surface stains only and do not contain bleach overthecounter and professional whitening products contain carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide that helps lighten the color deep in the tooth whitening toothpastes can lighten the tooths color by about one shade in contrast prescription strength whitening conducted in your dentists office can make your teeth three to eight shades lighter overthecounter whitening strips and gels whitening gels are clear peroxidebased gels applied with a small brush directly to the surface of your teeth instructions vary depending on the strength of the peroxide follow the directions on the product carefully initial results are seen in a few days and final results are sustained for about four months whitening strips are very thin virtually invisible strips that are coated with a peroxidebased whitening gel the strips should be applied according to the instructions on the label initial results are seen in a few days and final results are sustained for about four months whitening rinses among the newest whitening products available are whitening rinses like most mouthwashes they freshen breath and help reduce dental plaque and gum disease but these products also include ingredients such as hydrogen peroxide in some which whiten teeth manufacturers say it may take  weeks to see results you just swish them around in your mouth for  seconds twice a day before brushing your teeth however some experts say that rinses may not be as effective as other overthecounter whitening products because a whitening rinse is only in contact with the teeth for such a short time  just two minutes a day compared to  minutes for many strips  it may have less of an effect continued traybased tooth whiteners traybased tooth whitening systems purchased either overthecounter or from a dentist involve filling a mouth guardlike tray with a gel whitening solution  which contains a peroxidebleaching agent the tray is worn for a period of time generally from a couple of hours a day to every day during the night for up to four weeks and even longer depending on the degree of discoloration and desired level of whitening inoffice whitening inoffice bleaching provides the quickest way to whiten teeth with inoffice bleaching the whitening product is applied directly to the teeth these products can be used in combination with heat a special light or a laser results are seen in only one  to minute treatment but to achieve dramatic results several appointments are usually needed however with inoffice bleaching dramatic results can be seen after the first treatment this type of whitening is also the most expensive approach   how long do whitening effects last teeth whitening is not permanent people who expose their teeth to foods and beverages that cause staining may see the whiteness start to fade in as little as one month those who avoid foods and beverages that stain may be able to wait one year or longer before another whitening treatment or touchup is needed the degree of whiteness will vary from individual to individual depending on the condition of the teeth the level of staining and the type of bleaching system used at home vs dentist supervised doityourself methods arent the same as getting your teeth whitened by a professional youll want to consider a few important differences strength of bleaching agent overthecounter products and dentistsupervised athome products usually contain a lower strength bleaching agent with about a  to  carbamide peroxide content which is equivalent to about  hydrogen peroxide inoffice professionally applied tooth whitening products contain hydrogen peroxide in concentrations ranging from  to  mouthpiece trays with dentistsupervised athome bleaching products your dentist will take an impression of your teeth and make a mouthpiece tray that is customized to exactly fit your teeth this customization allows for maximum contact between the whitening gel which is applied to the mouthpiece tray and the teeth a custommade tray also minimizes the gels contact with gum tissue continued overthecounter whitening products also contain a mouthpiece tray but the onesizefitsall approach means that the fit will not be exact illfitting trays can irritate the gum and soft tissue by allowing more bleaching gel to seep onto these tissues with inoffice procedures youll get the bleaching agent applied directly to your teeth additional protective measures in the office setting your dentist will apply either a gel to the gum tissue or use a rubber shield which slides over the teeth prior to treatment to protect your gums and oral cavities from the effects of the bleaching overthecounter products dont provide these extra protective measures costs overthecounter bleaching systems are the least expensive option with inoffice whitening being the costliest supervised vs unsupervised process first your dentist can perform an oral exam and consider your complete medical history which can be helpful in determining if bleaching is an appropriate course of treatment based on the type and extent of stains and the number and location of restorations your dentist can then better match the type of stain with the best treatment if appropriate to lighten those stains when your dentist does it hell likely want to see you a couple of times to clear up any questions about the directions to make sure the customized tray fits properly to check your gums for signs of irritation and to generally see how the process is working with overthecounter bleaching products youre on your own   should you whiten your teeth whitening is not recommended or will be less successful in the following circumstances age and pregnancy issues bleaching is not recommended in children under the age of  this is because the pulp chamber or nerve of the tooth is enlarged until this age teeth whitening under this condition could irritate the pulp or cause it to become sensitive teeth whitening is also not recommended in pregnant or lactating women sensitive teeth and allergies individuals with sensitive teeth and gums receding gums andor defective restorations should consult with their dentist prior to using a toothwhitening system anyone allergic to peroxide the whitening agent should not use a bleaching product continued gum disease worn enamel cavities and exposed roots individuals with gum disease or teeth with worn enamel are generally discouraged from undergoing a toothwhitening procedure cavities need to be treated before undergoing any whitening procedure this is because the whitening solutions penetrate into any existing decay and the inner areas of the tooth which can cause sensitivity also whitening procedures will not work on exposed tooth roots because roots do not have an enamel layer fillings crowns and other restorations toothcolored fillings and resin composite materials used in dental restorations crowns veneers bonding bridges do not whiten therefore using a whitening agent on teeth that contain restorations will result in uneven whitening  in this case making the teeth without restorations appear lighter than those with restorations any whitening procedure should be done prior to the placement of restorations people with numerous restorations that would result in uneven whitening may be better off considering bonding veneers or crowns rather than a tooth whitening system ask your dentist what strategy is best for you unrealistic expectations individuals who expect their teeth to be a new blinding white may be disappointed with their results smokers need to be aware that their results will be limited unless they refrain from continued smoking particularly during the bleaching process a healthy guide to is to achieve a shade slightly whiter than the whites of your eyes darkly stained teeth yellowish teeth respond well to bleaching brownishcolored teeth respond less well and grayishhue or purplestained teeth may not respond to bleaching at all bluegray staining caused by the antibiotic tetracycline is more difficult to lighten and may require up to six months of home treatments or several inoffice appointments to successfully lighten teeth that have dark stains may be better candidates for another lightening option such as veneers bonding or crowns your dentist can discuss the options best suited for you risks associated with whitening the two side effects that occur most often with teeth whitening are a temporary increase in tooth sensitivity and mild irritation of the soft tissues of the mouth particularly the gums tooth sensitivity often occurs during early stages of the bleaching treatment tissue irritation most commonly results from an illfitting mouthpiece tray rather than the toothbleaching agent both of these conditions usually are temporary and disappear within  to  days of stopping or completing treatment if you do experience sensitivity you can reduce or eliminate it by wearing the tray for a shorter period of time for example two minute sessions vs two minute sessions stop whitening your teeth for  to  days to allow teeth to adjust to the process ask your dentist or pharmacist for a high fluoridecontaining product which can help remineralize your teeth apply the fluoride product to the tray and wear for  minutes prior to and following the whitening agent brush teeth with a toothpaste made for sensitive teeth these toothpastes contain potassium nitrate which helps soothe the teeths nerve endings continued whitening product safety some whitening products you get through dentists offices as well as professionally applied inoffice bleaching products have the american dental association ada seal of acceptance which tells you that the product meets ada guidelines for safety and effectiveness currently only dentistdispensed homeuse products containing  carbamide peroxide and officeapplied products containing  hydrogen peroxide have this seal overthecounter bleaching products are not endorsed by the ada because the organization believes that professional consultation is important to ensuring safe and effective use no whitening products using lasers are on the adas list of accepted products several whitening toothpastes available in drugstores have received the seal too you can find a list at wwwadaorg not all manufacturers seek the adas seal of acceptance this is a voluntary program that requires considerable expense and time on the part of a manufacturer just because a product doesnt have the seal does not necessarily mean that the product isnt safe and effective teeth whiteners are not drugs and therefore arent regulated by the fda choosing an overthecounter whitening kit try to select a product that allows the mouthpiece to be customized some kits come with a tray that can be molded to some degree these are better than others that come with a standard mouthpiece look for online reviews and ask around to find out what others who may have already tried the kit youre considering think about it if at any time you experience a prolonged change in the color of your gums or an increased tooth sensitivity to hot or cold foods and beverages stop wearing the mouthpiece and see your dentist immediately pagination top picks should i try oil pulling do your kids have good dental habits getting the most out of your dental visit whats causing your jaw pain

am so scared of the dentist i really am i take insanely good care of my teeth and they may not be the whitest but they chew ok and don’t hurt ever and serve me well the only time my teeth bother me is in my dreams when they fall out and fill my mouth with blood at inopportune moments like during the sat for some reason i am forever taking the sat in my dreams which is weird because i don’t even remember taking it in real life but my dreamscape is littered with number  pencils and tiny bubbles left unfilled i know that i need to go to the dentist soon but my feet drag behind me and there’s a herculean effort in lifting my finger to dial those numbers on my iphone you and what army are going to make me go get my teeth cleaned it’s not about pain i am heavily tattooed and i can take hundreds upon hundreds of hours of impromptu and anesthesia free sessions without complaint it can be nervous business getting a tattoo but i never flinch or falter or become pale with the pinpricks i go with the pinches and the burn because i love the results with teeth since i haven’t had any problems the rewards are not as visible or satisfying as a child i had countless hours of oral surgery that left my psyche and mouth full of holes stitched up crudely with thick black thread that tasted of blood and bone my teeth had not lined up side by side as i grew rather they placed themselves haphazardly along my gumline like headstones in an outlaw graveyard during the s there was a civil war quality to my mouth and all my parents money went into the correction of this orthodontists and dentists were my babysitters and i spent most of the hours between pm reclined in a chair with a light shining into my eyes and a tray and towel pinned to my neck about half my teeth were removed as they came in huge and white and mighty to replace the feeble baby ones that were once there there was no reasonable way my mouth could accommodate them all so they got yanked being as big and deeply buried in my jaw as they were it was no small feat to unearth them and my flesh was cut away to expose the roots and kill the healthy tooth at the base of where they lay i spit out huge bloody clots of spongy gum tissue and this sped my healing as they didn’t rot with decay the remaining teeth stood valiant and shiny and strong as the wire braces bound them into a kind of order that they still march in today the lines of my orthodontists plan have faltered slightly as the genetic pattern of teeth your original tooth destiny has strength beyond what headgear and wires are capable of controlling but even after  years they seem ok and i don’t think i need to go back for anything  comments add to the mix… do you know if the dance man is still alive or not an old website by fuckedcompanycom said he died i say bs on that he was that early sensation dude who danced all over california reply i have been told dreaming of “losing teeth” is symbolic to the idea “getting out of here” trying to get out of someplace sat hmmm… testing yourself reply i’m  and undergoing orthodontia followed by jaw surgery to fix my jackedup teeth i’ve had teeth pulled and spent hours in the orthodontist chair like you going to the dentist is really important though even if there’s nothing wrong with your teeth right now there’s a link between gingivitis and heart disease so regular cleanings along with taking care of your teeth is just good practice i don’t much like the dentist either so i totally understand where you’re coming from though reply talk about dentist unfortunately my parents never took me to the dentist as a child and i have not the money to get my teeth fixed i would guesstimate i need about  dollars done to them as i have a few missing teeth need of root canals a few implants rooting and scaling because of my periodontal disease and such it sucks to have bad teeth but it can also be hereditary too i suffer from panic attacks so i could only imagine getting done what i need done it’s not something that i am proud of and i am only  too young to be having such issues so hey on a lighter note at least some of your situations as far as “teeth” go aren’t as bad have a wonderful day  reply just wanted to note dreaming of losing teeth is quite common the reason is because it relates directly to tooth grinding while you sleep that’s why it feels so visceral and real… you actually are grinding your teeth and your dreaming brain interprets that as falling out or whatever the tooth grinding is normal and nothing to be concerned about unless your dentist has noticed it and let you know that’s why this is such a prevalent dream i dream about it all the time and don’t have any fears or qualms about going to the dentist in fact i enjoy it 🙂 reply i had really bad memories of going to the dentist as a kid the worst part wasn’t the pain although there was plenty of that the worst part is that i felt judged by the dentist who was critical of my brushing i was always a pretty diligent kid tho so i imagine a lot of the work i had to get done was related to genetics being older i am  now i still dread the dentist for the same reason – i hate being told that i’m not doing as good a job i try to tell myself – screw them – they are my teeth anyway i’m paying you asshole just fix my teeth and move on i don’t need a lecture unfortunately when i get in the chair though i always forget that and become this yearold ashamed for not doing better i’m off to the dentist tomorrow to start a series of appointments to get my teeth back in shape maybe this will be the time i stop worrying what other people think about me reply teeth my least favorite subject my teeth are mostly gone i treated my teeth very badly i would eat six or seven candy bars at a time as a kid i drank cokes all the time i have endured many many hours in the dentist’s chair i put off going to the dentist until i am in such pain that i absolutely cannot stand it i am stupid but i am not alone i am still not kind to my remaining teeth i have no excuses reading about your dental horror stories inspires me to never read such things again the last thing i want to do is think about my teeth until i absolutely have to how stupid is that reply leave a reply cancel reply pay what you want see tour dates margaret tweetsmy tweets news new tour fresh off the bloat

dental problem that involves discomfort or pain in teeth when encountering certain substances and temperatures at least  million adults suffer from sensitive teeth in the united states according to the academy of general dentistry  the pain is often sharp and sudden but it is temporary according to the cleveland clinic the pain may shoot into the tooths nerve endings fortunately sensitive teeth can be treated and the condition can improve  causes of tooth sensitivity there are no atrisk groups for tooth sensitivity it can happen to anyone according to dr margaret culottanorton a dentist in washington dc and former president of the dc dental society “the most common symptom sensitive teeth experience is a sudden sharp flash of pain when teeth are exposed to air cold sweet acidic or hot foods” she told live science some people may experience tooth sensitivity from brushing or flossing their teeth in healthy teeth enamel protects the underlying layer of dentin which is softer than enamel the tooth roots are protected by gums but if the enamel is worn down or if the gum line has receded then the dentin becomes exposed cavities cracked teeth gum recession enamel and root erosion all cause dentin to be exposed” culottanorton said “dentin is connected to the nerve that triggers pain in sensitive teeth dentin contains thousands of microscopic tubules or channels leading to the tooths pulp according to the academy of general dentistry when exposed to the elements these dentinal tubules allow heat cold acidic or even sticky substances to reach the nerves inside the tooth causing pain according to the cleveland clinic some factors that contribute to sensitive teeth may include brushing too hard or using a hardbristled toothbrush this can wear down enamel causing dentin to become exposed or encourage gum recession gum recession this often happens in people suffering from periodontal disease and it exposes the dentin gingivitis inflamed and sore gum tissue can result in exposure of the tooth’s root cracked teeth these can become filled with bacteria from plaque and cause inflammation in the pulp of the tooth in more severe cases it may lead to abscess and infection teeth grinding or clenching this can wear down enamel toothwhitening products these contain harsh chemicals to remove stains but can also remove the enamel plaque buildup longterm use of mouthwash some overthecounter mouthwashes contain acids if dentin is exposed dentin the acids can make existing tooth sensitivity worse and also further damage the dentin layer there are neutral fluoride mouthwashes available that might be a better option acidic foods these can encourage enamel reduction dental procedures teeth may be sensitive after professional cleaning root planing crown replacement and other tooth restoration procedures usually the pain will disappear in four to six weeks tooth sensitivity after filling some people may experience tooth sensitivity after having a cavity filled or a filling replaced according to the columbia university college of dental medicine the tooth decay that causes cavities irritates the tooth and the filling procedure while necessary can lead to further sensitivity fortunately tooth sensitivity after a filling should improve on its own within a few weeks it may last longer as much as a few months but as long as the tooth sensitivity shows gradual improvement there should be nothing to worry about persistent tooth sensitivity however may indicate that a root canal is needed sometimes after a filling teeth become sensitive when biting down this can be fixed with a simple bite adjustment additionally the filling may be too high according to columbia university in this case the dentist could lower the filling composite fillings may cause tooth sensitivity when chewing there is no pain when the teeth are clenched together however this tooth sensitivity is usually fixed by adjusting the bite or replacing the filling with another composite according to bear peak dental a private practice in boulder colorado sensitive teeth treatment sensitive teeth never completely disappear culottanorton said “symptoms may be less or even seem to go away for a while but unless the reasons why a persons teeth become sensitive are completely eliminated the sensitivity will come and go there are several types of treatment available and each dentist has his or her favorites that they are most likely to recommend according to culottanorton she stressed that there is no single treatment option that works for everyone proper diagnosis of the reason for the sensitivity is essential in treating sensitivity  if the reason for the sensitivity is addressed the treatment chosen will be more successful in decreasing pain  if the dentist just treats sensitivity without addressing the reason for it the problem will continue and get worse she said  the following are some athome treatments suggested by

share statement on the safety and effectiveness of tooth whitening products for the last two decades the ada council on scientific affairs has monitored the development and the increasing numbers of tooth whitening products as the market for these products grew the association recognized a need for uniform definitions when discussing whiteners for example whitening is any process that will make teeth appear whiter this can be achieved in two ways a product can bleach the tooth which means that it actually changes the natural tooth color bleaching products contain peroxides that help remove deep intrinsic and surface extrinsic stains by contrast nonbleaching whitening products contain agents that work by physical or chemical action to help remove surface stains only whitening products may be administered by dentists in the dental office dispensed by dentists for homeuse or purchased overthecounter otc and can be categorized into two major groups peroxidecontaining bleaching agents and whitening toothpastes dentifrices peroxidecontaining bleaching agents carbamide peroxide used in many bleaching products breaks down into hydrogen peroxide and urea with hydrogen peroxide being the active bleaching agent a bleaching product containing  percent carbamide peroxide yields approximately  percent hydrogen peroxide the most commonly observed side effects with these peroxidebased bleaching agents are tooth sensitivity and occasional irritation of soft tissues in the mouth oral mucosa particularly the gums tooth sensitivity often occurs during early stages of bleaching treatment tissue irritation may result from an illfitting tray used to contain bleaching product both tooth sensitivity and tissue irritation are usually temporary and stop after the treatment on rare occasions irreversible tooth damage has been reported patients should be cautioned that not enough information is available to support unsupervised longterm andor repeated use of bleaching products dentistdispensed and otc homeuse products dentistdispensed and otc homeuse tooth whitening bleaches are eligible for the ada seal of acceptance the products in this category that currently bear the ada seal contain  percent carbamide peroxide however participation in the program is not limited to products of this concentration or type of bleach there are many whitening product options currently available to consumers both from the dentist as well as from retail outlets including gels placed in trays that cover the teeth painton materials bleaching strips and others the level and type of active ingredients the form of the product and how they are applied may vary widely in a waterbased solution carbamide peroxide breaks down into hydrogen peroxide and urea with hydrogen peroxide being the active bleaching agent other ingredients of peroxidecontaining tooth whiteners may include glycerin carbopol sodium hydroxide and flavoring agents professionally applied bleaching products there are many professionally applied tooth bleaching products used by dentists in office these products use hydrogen peroxide in concentrations ranging from  percent to  percent and are sometimes used together with a light or laser which the companies state accelerate or activate the whitening process however most studies have reported no additional longterm benefit with lightactivated systems prior to application of professional products gum tissues are protected either by isolation with a rubber dam or application of a gel whereas homeuse products are intended for use over a twotofour week period the inoffice professional procedure is usually completed in about one hour due to the discontinuation of the professional component of the seal program on december   professionally applied bleaching products are no longer eligible for the ada seal of acceptance whitening toothpastes whitening toothpastes dentifrices in the ada seal of acceptance program contain polishing or chemical agents that are designed to improve tooth appearance by removing surface stains they do this through gentle polishing chemical chelation or some other nonbleaching actions several whitening toothpastes that are available otc have received the ada seal of acceptance summary the ada recommends that if you choose to use a bleaching product you should only do so after consultation with a dentist this is especially important for patients with many fillings crowns and extremely dark stains a thorough oral examination performed by a licensed dentist is essential to determine if bleaching is an appropriate course of treatment the dentist and patient together can determine the most appropriate treatment the dentist may then advise the patient and supervise the use of bleaching agents
