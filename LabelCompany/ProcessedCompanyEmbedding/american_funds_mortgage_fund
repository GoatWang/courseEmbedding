it from a more growthoriented strategy to a more incomeoriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date investment professionals continue to manage each fund for  years after it reaches its target date the target allocations are as of january   and are subject to the portfolio oversight committees discretion the funds’ investment adviser anticipates that the funds will invest their assets within a range that deviates no more than  above or below these allocations investment professionals gradually adjust the portfolio over time so that it becomes more preservationoriented the funds allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors education savings goals will be met the target date is the year in which the beneficiary is expected to begin taking withdrawals investors
