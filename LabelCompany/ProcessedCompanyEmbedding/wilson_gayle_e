seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»throwing in the towel on gileadapr  about gilead sciences gild brad kenagy long only portfolio strategy dividend investing etf investingsummaryi finally threw in the towel on gilead after years of owning the stockdevelopments in the last couple months led me to finally get outthe contributing factors were poor guidance management sales and a lack of a needlemoving acquisitionin this article i will be going over why i finally threw in the towel on shares of gilead nasdaqgild after being long and bullish on the stock for years there were three reasons why i decided to drop my shares of gilead poor guidance constant management sales and failing to make a needlemoving acquisition towel image from google search poor guidance after posting  billion in revenues in  it was a big surprise when gilead announced guidance for  of only  billion it was expected that sales would decline given the decline in hcv sales just not many expected the magnitude of the decline in sales yearyear while the overall sales guidance was disappointing the major disappoint for me was guidance for nonhcv sales gilead guided for nonhcv product sales of  billion which was a disappointment given that in  nonhcv product sales were  billion therefore even at the high end of the  guidance if gilead were to achieve  billion in nonhcv sales this represents only an increase of  back in may  i argued that even though investors were valuing the hcv business at  the nonhcv business was worth more than the price of the stock at that time given the growth prospects in that article i modeled for  growth in nonhcv as that was the average growth over the previous two years when gilead came out with the guidance for  i updated my valuation and it showed that based on the significantly lower growth rate  vs  the nonhcv business was now overvalued and thus was one of the contributing reasons for why i sold my position in gilead nonhcv valuation to determine the fair value for gileads nonhcv business i conducted a discounted cash flow analysis table below and the data shows that based on the guidance for nonhcv shares of gilead are overvalued to determine the projected fcf for the nonhcv business i used the following table i looked at the percentage of sales that free cash flows were last year and applied that to the  sales guidance i then looked at the guidance for nonhcv vs hcv and found that gilead estimates just over  of sales will be from nonhcv products finally i applied that percentage to my estimate for  total fcf to arrive at the amount of fcf i estimated that would come from nonhcv products  sales   fcf  fcf as  of sales   highend sales guidance   guidance  fcf  of sales   of sales nonhcv highend guidance   hcv guidance   estimated nonhcv fcf  i used fcf data from the table above growth data from the guidance paragraph above and to determine the discount rate  terminal growth rate i used the following calculators as you can see in the table below based on the guidance that the nonhcv growth rate will be declining and debt having increased since last year the value of gileads nonhcv business is  below the current price this was one of the determining factors as to why i sold my position in gilead discount rate calculator terminal growth calculator fcfshare  shares   lt debtshare   proj longterm growth rate  terminal

by insiders using data from finviz the data shows that over the last year insiders have sold  million shares of gilead for a total of  million over the last year gilead has increased its dividend from share to share which is an increase of  therefore why would large insider gilead shareholders sell large amounts of stock if the dividends they receive on those shares will increase nearly  yearyear the answer they think the gilead share price will continue to decline and a current yield of  and the prospects to turn revenues around are not appealing if a  dividend which is growing  is not good enough for insiders then it is probably not good enough for other shareholders as well in addition if gilead were to be thinking about an acquisition that would turn things around and stabilize revenues i would think insiders would not be selling because an acquisition would most likely be viewed positively by the market insider trading relationship date cost shares value  alton gregg h evp

wilson gayle e director feb    totals   table data from finviz no acquisitions as i noted above if management was about to make a large acquisition that would turn the revenue decline around it would most likely not continue selling stock this leads me to believe that gilead will continue to make small acquisitions andor partnerships gilead has had this strategy for years and the market has been waiting for gilead to make a big splash however with the uncertainty over the future of the affordable care act aca it is likely gilead will not even consider making a large acquisition until everything is sorted out for the aca i believe gilead missed its opportunity for a large acquisition in  when biotech nasdaqibb stocks were at depressed prices with the biotech sector near the high end of its range over the last nearly year and a half if gilead were to make a large acquisition it would likely be overpaying chart from thinkorswim closing thoughts in closing i finally sold my position in gilead because nonhcv product growth was guided to slow down management has continued selling shares over the past year and it is likely that gilead will not make a large acquisition
