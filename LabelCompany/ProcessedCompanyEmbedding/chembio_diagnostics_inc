assay sure check® hiv  hiv  statpak® and hiv  statpak® dipstick tests are easytoperform singleuse diagnostic tests for the rapid visual detection of antibodies to hiv  and hiv  the standard screening test for antibodies to hiv is the enzyme immunoassay eia or elisa this test requires two visits to a clinic or medical facility – something that is not always feasible rapid pointofcare poc tests have been developed which produce results within  minutes or less and are less costly for testing agencies to perform due to the fewer outreach visits required to deliver results also studies have shown that rapid tests are as sensitive and specific as conventional immunoassays syphilis utilizing chembio’s patented dual path platform technology dpp® syphilis screen  confirm permits the simultaneous yet separate detection of both trep and nontrep markers at the pointofcare the test format allows use in pointofcare settings therefore represents a considerable advance in diagnosis as well as in time to treatment and ease of use standard diagnosis of syphilis is currently done using two different laboratorybased serologic tests namely a nontreponemal screening test usually either the rapid plasma reagin rpr or venereal disease research laboratory vdrl followed by a more specific treponemal confirmatory eia assay chembio has developed the first dual nontreponemal  treponemal poc syphilis test syphilis caused by the bacterial spirochete treponema pallidum is a significant source of human morbidity and mortality worldwide in fact it is estimated that there are over  million cases of syphilis occurring worldwide every year chagas chembio diagnostic systems inc’s chagas statpak® assay is easytoperform requires no cold chain storage uses a minimal sample size and provides visual detection of antibodies to t cruzi because traditional testing methods require laboratory equipment and storage they aren’t effective methods in the more rural areas where chagas is most common recognized as one of the world’s neglected diseases chagas is a major public health concern in latin america and is a growing concern in the united states and regions of europe as the number of infected immigrants increase chagas is transmitted by trypanosoma cruzi a protozoan parasite of the hematophagous triatomine insect and may cause cardiomyopathy syndromes of the esophagus and colon and eventually in chronic myocarditis resulting in high morbidity and mortality it is curable if detected and treated early but there is no effective treatment once it has become chronic human

earnings esp expected surprise prediction looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp
