of cash on hand borrowings from the partnerships senior secured revolving credit facility and the proceeds of pbfxs equity offering which was announced today pbf energy logo pbfx and pbf energy chief executive officer thomas nimbley said the potential acquisition of a  percent interest in the torrance valley pipeline company reflects pbfxs ongoing commitment to deliver sustained growth to our unit holders and diversify our earnings base with highquality assets mr nimbley continued pbf shareholders would also be expected to benefit from this transaction as pbf energy would receive additional

independent directors and was advised by piper jaffray  co its financial advisor and vinson  elkins llp its legal counsel nongaap measures pbf logistics lp reconciliation of amounts under us gaap to forecasted ebitda unaudited in millions reconciliation of fifty percent tvpc acquired interest estimated net income to estimated ebitda estimated net income  add depreciation and amortization expense  add interest expense net and other financing costs  estimated ebitda  the partnership defines ebitda as net income loss before net interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization expense ebitda is a nongaap supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies may use to assess our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unit holders our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities the partnerships management believes that the presentation of ebitda provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income operating income cash from operations or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income additionally because ebitda may be defined differently by other companies in our industry our definition of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing its utility due to the forwardlooking nature of forecasted ebitda information to reconcile forecasted ebitda to forecasted cash flow from operating activities is not available as
