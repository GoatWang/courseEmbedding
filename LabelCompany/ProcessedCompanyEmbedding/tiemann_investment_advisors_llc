future generations strategy is congress on the brink of shooting itself in the    checkbook congress seems to have forgotten that the value of the american dollar is based upon the strength of belief in the ability of us government and federal banks to meet their obligations if congress fails to raise the debt ceiling this could trigger a whole host of defaults which could impact the value of the dollars we americans carry in our pockets dr tiemann explains why raising the debt ceiling matters to the stability of the whole banking system click here to read dr tiemanns viewpoint on why the debt ceiling debate matters also recently published in the fts long room search the tia site search for tweets by tiemannia investors benefit from access to real expertise too many individual investors do not have direct access to an investment expert  even extraordinarily high net worth individuals and wellendowed family offices with complex portfolios often deal with advisors who use thirdparty funds or outside managers to actually handle their clients investments  they never speak directly with the investment expert who manages their funds as a result they can have trouble finding out when their funds are overlapping overpaying with layers of fees or simply failing to make timely decisions that cost them in total market return  dr jonathan tiemann founded tiemann investment advisors tia to help address this need for individual investors building on dr tiemanns twenty years of highlevel experience in academia and institutional money management tia embodies a distinctive investment philosophy and implementation strategy that makes real investment expertise accessible to individuals—so your questions get answered and you are confident that your portfolio is structured for your needs tia applies academic rigor institutional knowhow thoughtful individual analysis and the leverage of technology so we stay costeffective — to the design and management of your unique portfolio dr tiemann a top investment expert rather than a sales representative works directly with you he analyzes your situation designs your investment program manages your portfolio and restores your confidence in many traditional investment firms the clientfacing staff – the financial “advisors” – are primarily and functionally salespeople depending on the firm they may really be brokers rather than investment advisors such individuals while friendly and charming earn commissions based upon what financial products they can sell to their clients  lacking deep investment expertise they may rely on some basic tools — sometimes displaying impressive bells and whistles — to choose from a narrow menu of investment portfolios at their firm  their clients will never get access to a real investment expert — those experts oversee template portfolios and attend group promotional events in support of the large sales teams  you may get introduced to one of those experts but in most traditional firms they will not ever really know you your specific circumstances – or your portfolio tia eliminates the sales intermediary and brings the expert dr tiemann to the center of the process you and he meet directly discussing you your family your financial needs and your portfolio he evaluates the cost basis and tax issues that characterize your existing investments then he designs the right portfolio that balances structure with flexibility outlook with cash and taxability needs presenting a proposal to you to review and approve if you have an existing portfolio tias proposal will consider trading costs tax impacts and the expenses of your existing investments only then will tia proceed to implement your new portfolio carefully tweaking an existing portfolio to minimize trading costs tax impacts excess management layers and other frictional costs to best exploit the aftertax returns available to you you will get tias monthly and quarterly reports on market and portfolio
