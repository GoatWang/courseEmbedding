fantom® bioresorbable scaffold unique bioresorbable polymers reva scientists working in collaboration with rutgers university have developed families of proprietary bioresorbable polymers that can be applied to a variety of medical applications we are currently focused on applying our polymer technology to the development of drugeluting bioresorbable scaffolds for the treatment of coronary artery disease revas high performance polymers have the structural properties to achieve the scaffold strength required to treat challenging lesions that are restricting blood flow to the heart in addition reva polymers are uniquely visible under standard angiography ie xray which allows the physician to check the placement and expansion of the scaffold in the artery during the implant procedure polymers used in nonreva scaffolds are invisible and physicians must rely on small permanent markers to determine where those scaffolds are positioned our operating facility includes laboratories for polymer development and synthesis which also enables us to manufacture commercialgrade polymers at the scale needed to support planned clinical trials and initial product commercialization reva polymers have shown feasibility for use as embolic beads and have the potential for use as a drugdelivery vehicle for other pharmaceutical applications reva scientists have also created and patent protected nonbiodegradable polymer variants for medical uses these materials may be wellsuited for a variety of product applications including spinal repair cement that closely matches the mechanical

invasive medical devices that leverage our proprietary technologies guided by an executive management team with extensive product development experience and working closely with skilled interventional cardiologists in multiple countries our primary focus is the development of drugeluting bioresorbable coronary scaffolds for the treatment of cardiovascular disease the leading cause of death

alternative to metal stents which are small tubelike devices permanently implanted into an artery and are commonly used to treat coronary artery disease both stents and scaffolds help stabilize diseased coronary arteries by propping them open and restoring blood flow they provide a minimally invasive and effective treatment avoiding the need for patients to undergo invasive bypass ie openheart surgery procedures bioresorbable scaffolds are designed to provide all of the proven benefits of commercial metal stents with the advantage of resorbing ie disappearing from the body over a period of time after the artery has stabilized and healed scaffolds maintain their strength during the critical healing period which is generally believed to be approximately three to four months after implant as the scaffold resorbs the artery is able to move naturally a result not attainable with metal stents that are permanent and may continue to cause injury to the artery because bioresorbable scaffolds are not permanent they may delay the further progression of coronary artery disease and reduce the rate of future adverse clinical events potential benefits that have yet to be proven bioresorbable scaffolds also allow for enhanced retreatment options by reducing restrictions on future treatment and are inherently more appealing especially to younger patients cardiovascular stent market potential in  approximately  million stents were implanted around the world and coronary stent sales were estimated at nearly us billion the coronary stent market is currently dominated
