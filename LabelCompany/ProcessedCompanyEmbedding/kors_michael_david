going on with the economy i think women are realizing that maybe they dont need a closet full of clothes they just need the right clothes michael kors women think clothes a man in a well tailored suit will always shine brighter than a guy in an offtherack suit michael kors man shine will there are two kinds of designers ones who are very happy locked in their office surrounded by their coterie the last thing they need to do is to go to a trunk show theyd go running for the hills i not only enjoy it i think how do you design things that are applicable to life  unless you live it michael kors life happy design when you try on something you have to ask yourself how many ways could i wear this could i wear it to work to dinner or drinks will it span the seasons if you have to think too hard about those questions then skip it michael kors work yourself dinner my legacy would be that you dont have to give up anything you can be chic but have a sense of humor you can be sexy but comfortable you can be timeless but fresh michael kors humor sexy legacy for me true luxury can be caviar or a day with no meetings no appointments and no schedule michael kors day meetings me i grew up surrounded by these tough ballsy strong women they were also adoring women but they were the kind of women who would argue over what kind of pants you were wearing or the color of your nail polish michael kors women strong color when i was a kid i was trendier id wear anything i was in love beads and platforms michael kors love kid platforms i think the older i get the more i realize that the ultimate luxury is time michael kors time realize think learn to invest in the best quality you can afford and wear pieces in different ways michael kors best quality learn the biggest lesson that ive learned is that fashion is this tightrope where you have to be consistent but inconsistent you need the connective thread but at the same time you need a sense of surprise michael kors time fashion surprise i know what women look good in i dont think the rules ever change michael kors change women good people want to look taller and thinner no one says ooh let me buy that dress because it makes me feel matronly michael kors dress look people americans are always a little bit insecure michael kors little always little bit clothes are like a good meal a good movie great pieces of music michael kors music good great i am the oldest young designer in new york city michael kors i am city young give me caviar kaspia and give me a hamburger i love the two extremes michael kors love me two i
