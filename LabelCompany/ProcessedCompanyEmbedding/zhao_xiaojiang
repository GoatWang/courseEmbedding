chinese application serial number  filed on dec   the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety field of the invention  the present invention relates to a catalyst for the preparation of high molecular weight aliphatic polycarbonate and the preparation of the catalyst the present invention further relates to a method for the preparation of high molecular weight aliphatic polycarbonate by using the catalyst of the present invention background of the invention  venting of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in large amount results in “greenhouse effect” which is detrimental to the environment carbon dioxide is an environmental polluting gas but from another point of view carbon dioxide is an abundant natural resource one of the main hot spots for research is to utilize carbon dioxide as a raw material for synthesizing polymeric materials these materials could be used as biodegradable packaging materials medical materials adhesives and additives for composites  it was reported in us pat no  us pat no  and us pat no  that alternating copolymers mn of carbon dioxide and epoxy compounds as well as various polyurethane and polyethers were synthesized by using alkyl zinccompounds containing active hydrogen as the catalysts in jp  and jp  expensive complex of metal and porphyrin was used as the catalyst although this catalyst gave higher catalytic efficiencies  g polymermol catalyst the molecular weights of polymers obtained were relatively low number average molecular weight mn was approximately  and the polymerization time was more than  days in chinese patent application no zl and zl anionic coordinated bimetallic catalytic systems were used the catalytic efficiency was  g polymermol catalyst yet due to the difficulty of removing the supporting materials polycarbonate thus obtained was hard to be purified in addition the molecular weight of the polymer thus obtained still needs to be raised it was reported in macromolecules    macromolecules    and polymer preprint    that a rareearth ternary catalyst system can be used for the synthesis of polycarbonate the former used rareearth ester of phosphonic acid as the catalyst which has a lower catalytic efficiency and lower degree of carbon dioxide fixation  wt  polycarbonate obtained by this catalyst was a block copolymer the latter paper described that the percentage of the alternative sequence structure was higher than  but the coordination compound used was expensive and the catalytic efficiency needed to be raised a comprehensive review on the catalysts and polymerization systems used in the syntheses of polycarbonate was published in j polymer sci part a polym chem    it was pointed out that except for a few zinc salt catalytic systems polymerization time was  hours most of the processes were polymerization processes involving organic solvents like dioxane dioxolane dioxymethane hexane benzene tetrahydrofuran toluene or a mixture thereof by using zinc salt of glutaric acid as the catalyst for nonsolvent polymerization it is possible to obtain polycarbonate with high catalytic efficiency however it needs a polymerization time of  hours and also very critical polymerization conditions  chinese patent application no  and  described methods for preparing rareearth complex ternary catalyst and high molecular weight aliphatic polycarbonate
