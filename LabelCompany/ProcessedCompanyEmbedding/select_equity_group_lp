include private investmentsour research universe has now grown to over  businesses across geographies and market capitalizations select equity  research process home  contact us  client login our investment and research process provides a consistent rigorous and repeatable approach to identifying and analyzing businesses this has allowed us to deliver absolute returns for our clients while preserving capital and mitigating downside risk our analyst team identifies and vets its own ideas through a disciplined bottomup process that often entails years of study before a core investment is made our analysts are members of a collective research pool that supports all portfolios at the firm our research is conducted independently with a focus on developing fresh perspectives on companies or value chains in order to preserve our objectivity select equity analysts make almost no use of wall street research on the long side and do not actively exchange insights with our peers as a result we believe our portfolios tend to be highly differentiated from those of other managers our process includes extensive quantitative analysis as well as qualitative fieldwork conducted by a dedicated team of six former financial journalists and five sourcing specialists our analysts are generalists but focus on value chain analysis studying suppliers manufacturers distributors and customers within specialized areas of the economy and looking at companies across geographies and market capitalizations our focus on detailed value chain analysis is driven by the multiyear holding period for most of our core investments we are interested in predicting a company’s earnings power during the next three to five years rather than in the next quarter by investing in businesses with clean balance sheets strong market positions predictable growth sustainable barriers to competition and the ability to prosper regardless of economic cycles we hope to reduce the risk of significant capital loss even in the face of adverse news in evaluating potential investment opportunities we weigh downside risk more heavily than upside reward portfolio managers have primary responsibility to oversee and manage risk but generally do so within clear portfoliospecific guidelines on leverage position sizing concentration market cap exposure and other metrics select equity group lp  marketing contacts  names and
