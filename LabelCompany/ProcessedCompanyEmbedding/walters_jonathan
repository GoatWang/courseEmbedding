some pictures of the construction and population of the exhibition space posted may    author jstwalt  filed under field  leave a comment these are the final boards for my heritage project for display during my end of year exhibition posted april    author jstwalt  filed under exhibition field  leave a comment we have cleared the studio and moved a lot of the furniture out of the space giving us a large area to start building our exhibition in i didn’t realised how large the space was and how much stuff there was to move until everything was cleared but now we have done it its a lot easier to picture what the space will eventually look like posted april    author jstwalt  filed under exhibition field  leave a comment the past few weeks have been taken up with general exhibition planning sorting out details finalising things like the budget and the design of print materials etc everyone is pretty happy with the new idea so we are going ahead with that the space team is still finalising that concept too but everything is well under way the next step will be to clear the studio and start setting up posted april    author jstwalt  filed under field  leave a comment heritage is the knowledge passed down from generation to generation it can be associated with objects or passed on via word of mouth history consists of the summation of human lives individuals make choices and these choices add together to create the events we remember we each play a part humanity is likely to increase in knowledge as time goes on but noone will know as much about today as we do knowledge and myth can become indistinguishable with time how can we preserve our knowledge and pass it on to future generations what can we leave behind  posted april    author jstwalt  filed under exhibition field  leave a comment the exhibition finances were all taken care of without much input needed from me which makes me think it was too big for the jobs assigned to it it is too late to change teams now though so i will have to continue contributing to this exhibition in a more general sense ← older entries search for my name is jon walters i am  and graduating this year from cardiff met product design throughout this course i have designed a wide range of products but the designs on display here represent the best resolved and most thoroughly thought out designs i have created so far i like products which appear simple on the surface but have a depth of thought behind them so this is what i have aimed to achieve through these pieces i believe successful design is rooted in art and history inspired by nature but informed by what has been done before i therefore aimed this year to design new products based on old ideas such as those of the arts and crafts movement i feel this adds additional layers of complexity to simple concepts and results in more wellrounded and complete ideas archives may  april  march  february  january  december  november  october  may  april  march

interested customers you otherwise might not reach what is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a

does my ad appear your ads could appear on the top or to the right of bing yahoo and msn search results and you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website expand your targeting both for location and for devices computer mobile and tablet make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer customers visit your site but if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid that would lower your costperclick and help stretch your budget how do i know if bing ads is working view a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats ad clicks the number of times your ad appeared impressions spend average costperclick clickthrough rate average ad position cost per acquisition and conversions you can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing can i run more than one ad yes in fact we encourage it only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see whats working best with your target customers frequently businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages getting started with bing ads how do i get started sign up for bing ads which keywords should i choose

of the freshness of find me finding you comes from working and playing within the source ensemble and exploring new sound combinations via a set of youthful and evolving musical relationships laetitia recognized the energy of the tracks in their initial form and sought to preserve their vitality by not retaking too many performances — instead the rawness in the tracks was retained and refined at the mixing stage maintaining an edge throughout when we hear synth lines diving lifting and drifting unusual guitar textures the plucked sound of flat wound bass strings or the bottomless pulsing of bass pedals stepping out of the mix with an exquisite vibrancy this is the sound of the source ensemble a key to laetitia’s music is her use of vocal arrangements throughout finding me finding you the shifting accompaniment creates space to bring this element gloriously forward arranged by laetitia with joe watson and jeff parker making string charts that were subsequently transposed to vocal parts for several songs richly arranged choirs of voices provide depth along with the thrilling presence of extra breath in the sound laetitia’s communitypolitic is wellserved by the groups of voices lending support to the machining of the song craft providing additional uplift to her quintessentially forwardfacing viewpoint — as well as massed voices from three different countries sharing space in harmony working in collaboration is laetita’s traditions and a key to this album’s view on being free together it is necessary preferable and right the designation of source collective implies a new togetherness phase alongside longtime collaborators emmanuel mario and xavi munoz keyboard and flutes parts played by david thayer little tornados were essential contributions as well as further keys synths and electronics from phil m fu and several intense guitar sequences from mason le long chris a cummings aka marker starling laetitia’s favorite composer graciously wrote “deep background” for her the duet with hot chip’s alexis taylor on “love captive” not to mention rob mazurek’s distinctive coronet playing gives voice to an ideological cornerstone of find me finding you — that should we be responsible enough to endeavor into a world of basic incomes and open relationships we would make astonishing strides as a society these sorts of things can only be done in agreement with others expressing great compassion and expectation with startling immediacy as well as an abiding belief in an underlying unity that permeates and intimately binds all things and beings find me finding you combines a rigorous process for musicmaking with a deeply invested mindset making captivating music that promises many stimulating spins to come aug   pm a l t e r e d s t a t e s

all ages  the united states’ myriad inequalities hatreds and phobias are painfully evident in  offering proof that the ageold dichotomy of “political bands” versus “apolitical bands” simply doesn’t exist either you are comfortable and unfazed by the current reigning power structures or you choose or have no choice but to use your music as a vehicle for the dismantling of oppression and the creation of something better no matter what your songs are about you are choosing a side the position of providence ri’s downtown boys has been clear since they started storming through basements and diy spaces with their radicallyminded indefatigable rock music they are here to topple the whitecishet hegemony and draft a new history in the words of vocalist and lyricist victoria ruiz they are “five unique and individual people who believe in the spectrum of people experiences and emotions” on their selftitled  ep on sister polygon records run by their likeminded friends in priests they offered songs like “slumlord sal” which strikes out against abusive landlords its accompanying video relays the idea that cops can be literally smacked out of their oppressive mindsets and into an exuberantly queer dance party this is how downtown boys began combining revolutionary ideals with boundless energy and contagious inclusive fun and their resolve has only strengthened as both their sound and audience have grown cost of living is their third fulllength following a selfreleased  debut and ’s full communism on don giovanni records they recorded it with guy picciotto one of indierock’s most mythological figures in the producer’s chair although best known for his ability to sing while dangling from a basketball hoop he’s also produced pivotal albums by the gossip and blonde redhead among others “he very much enabled us to believe in what we were doing enough to get the record done and get it done well” says joey la neve defrancesco downtown boys’ guitarist vocalist and primary songwriter picciotto fostered the band’s improvisational urges while also pulling the root of their music to the forefront unflinching choruses fearlessly confrontational vocals and the sense that each song will incite the room into action sending bodies into motion that were previously thought to have atrophied downtown boys are keenly aware of the increased visibility and credibility that comes with signing to a corporatemedia conglomerate such as sub pop they’re using this platform as a megaphone for their protest music amplifying and centering chicana queer and latino voices in the fartoowhitewashed world of rock opener “a wall” rides the feelgood power that drove so many tunes by the clash and wire as it calls out the idea that a wall could ever succeed in snuffing the humanity and spirit of those it’s designed to crush “promissory note” is a bold selfintroduction to the exclusive clubs that either ignore downtown boys’ existence or possibly worse feign appreciation “so what’s the matter you don’t like what you see i can’t believe you’re even talking to me” ruiz shouts that she won’t light herself on fire to keep you warm and like underground rock pioneer alice bag’s vitriolic verse it’s a claim you wouldn’t dare question “tonta” one of the three songs written and sung primarily in spanish is an introspective and emotional portrait of anguish and it calls to mind the mighty scrum of huasipungo at an abc no rio matinee compared to previous efforts downtown boys have shifted from a oncemeaty brass section to the subtler melodic accompaniment of keyboards and a saxophone coloring their anthems with warm bright tones while ruiz spits out her frustrations passions and intents some might say it shows a sense of maturity as downtown boys have undoubtedly smoothed down some of their earlier edges but there is no compromise to their righteous assault and captivating presence like the socially conscious groups of years past from public enemy to rage against the machine downtown boys harness powerful sloganeering repetitive grooves and earworm hooks to create one of the most necessary musical statements of the day we should all do well to

sounds from another planet alludes to the promise of something that may or may not be there like a hope in something more the songs are about human resilience and the strength it takes to claw out of the darkest of spaces”michelle zauner wrote the debut japanese breakfast album in the weeks after her mother died of cancer thinking she would quit music entirely once it was done that wasn’t the case when psychopomp was released to acclaim in  she was forced to confront her grief zauner would find find herself reliving traumatic memories multiple times a day during interviews trying to remain composed while discussing the most painful experience of her life her sophomore album soft sounds from another planet is a transmutation of mourning a reflection that turns back on the cosmos in search of healing“i want to be a woman of regimen” zauner sings over a burbling synth on the album’s opening track “diving woman” this serves as zauner’s mission statement stick to the routine lest you get derailed don’t cling to the past don’t descend in fact ascend to the stars zauner found artistic solace removed from earth in outer space and science fiction “i used the theme as a means to disassociate from trauma” she explains “space used as a place of fantasy”and yet soft sounds from another planet isn’t a concept album over the course of  tracks zauner explores an expansive thematic universe a cohesive outpouring of unlike parts structured to create a galaxy of her own design in the instrumental “planetary ambience” synths communicate the way extraterrestrials might and on the shapeshifting single “machinist” which zauner has been performing live for over a year now she details the scifi narrative of a woman falling in love with a machine “it’s pure fiction” she explains “but it can map onto real relationships in a relevant way” the track which begins with spokenword ambience moves into autotune ‘s pop bliss and ends with a sultry saxophone solo perfectly marries the experience there’s a perceptible humanity in mechanical bodily eventswithin its astral production much of soft sounds from another planet stays grounded “road head” is the last chest compression in attempt to resuscitate a doomed relationship while the penultimate track “this house” is an acoustic dirge that honors zauner’s chosen family the baroque pop “boyish” has a haunting crystalline clarity that recalls the pathos of a roy orbison ballad while “body is a blade” embraces the dark intimacy of zauner’s pacific northwest heroes elliott smith and mount eeriewith help from coproducer craig hendrix who also coproduced little big league’s debut and jorge elbrecht ariel pink tamaryn who mixed the album zauner recontextualizes her bedroom pop beginnings expanding and maturing her sound the sheer massiveness of the big room production on soft sounds from another planet introduces listeners to a new japanese breakfast zauner’s familiar capacious voice will serve as their guide“your body is a blade that moves while your brain is writhing” she sings “knuckled under pain you mourn but your blood is flowing” there’s discernible pain in the phrasing zauner recognizing limitation a lack of control but then subverting the feeling creating her own musical language for confronting trauma where psychopomp introduced the world to japanese breakfast soft sounds dives deeper it builds space where there is none and suggests that in the face of tragedy we find ways to keep on living sep   pm quicksand saturday september   pm pm   buy ticketsdoors  pm  all ages sep

holding a handmade sign that read “i love naps but i stay woke” or “boys will be boys good humans” or “may the facts be with you” how adorable how upsetting how the hell are they going to make it to adulthood in this toxic environment deerhoof is right there with you they recognize that we are simultaneously living in two worlds one a maniacal mainstream monoculture hellbent on driving humankind into extinction the other a churning underground teeming with ideas and dogged optimism and the will to thrive and survive mountain moves refutes the former by ecstatically celebrating the latter though deerhoof have often made albums from start to finish with virtually no input from the outside world now is not the time for artists to operate in isolation mountain moves throws the doors wide open working quickly the band invited myriad guests to participate some of them dear friends others practically strangers they are of different ages different nationalities different disciplines the only common thread was that each and every artist on mountain moves doesn’t fit into a single neatlydefined category – and doesn’t wish to the results as expected were unexpected guide vocals and simple melodies were dispatched via email only to be answered with an outpouring of alternate harmonies suggestions for arrangements additional instrumentation every file received triggered a new rush of jumbled emotions some guests crafted their contributions in the small hours of the dawn toiling in hotel rooms before driving eight hours to the next tour date others hopped on the subway and recorded with the band inperson collisions and collusions abound on mountain moves in addition to its bounty of originals the program includes three covers that epitomize the album’s assemblage of disparate ideas and personalities reducing bob marley’s “small axe” to a beatless fragment of hymnlike simplicity magnifies the song’s rebellious spirit and undercurrent of violence deerhoof vocalist satomi matsuzaki a japanese immigrant lifts the staple singers’ “freedom highway” out of its original place and time imbuing it with a new sense of alienation from one’s own country snippets of the bass recitative “for behold darkness shall cover the earth” from handel’s messiah provide the foundation for a fresh take on chilean folk hero violeta parra’s bittersweet masterpiece “gracias a la vida” adventures outside the united states also informed the making of mountain moves during a recent visit to brazil the band was astonished to see how enthusiastically audiences at concerts sang danced and reveled – a cultural response they learned to the scarcity of resources for all but the nation’s wealthiest elites elsewhere the experience of confronting unfamiliar audiences of firedup red hot chili peppers fans taught them that one of their greatest skills – the ability to recalibrate their sound nightly to suit a particular venue – wasn’t limited to basements or small clubs the broader strokes of mountain moves sprang forth from lessons learned while trying to engage audiences of  across the vast distances of northern european sporting arenas if mountain moves were a movie it would be a double feature journey to the center of the deerhoof and escape from planet deerhoof shown sidebyside simultaneously the record epitomizes the band at its very best exploring new realms between the poles of independence and invention it also serves as a welcoming point of entry for new listeners outside deerhoof’s traditional orbit an opportunity to bring even more voices into the communal conversation we’re all in this together deerhoof is john dieterich satomi matsuzaki ed rodriguez and greg saunier the only thing they see eyetoeye on is the freedom to not see eyetoeye

noisemetal” outfit endon has largely eluded the attention of the broader western underground music community this began to change in  with the stateside release of their  album mama and tours along the east and west coasts given the west’s fascination with japan’s permutations of punk metal and noise it’s unlikely that any band that has been frequently bestowed with the designation of “the most extreme act in tokyo” would remain under the radar for long after all japan gave us the unmitigated sonic abrasions of masonna the nihilistic fury of gism and the cataclysmic lurch of corrupted so any band that can somehow further push the envelope is destined for notoriety and notoriety was certainly a factor in endon’s early years when singer taichi nagura terrorized local audiences with stage behavior so violent and menacing that people began actively avoiding their shows out of fear for their safety nagura insists that the outbursts were “not intended to be against the audience at all” but admits “during the early days of endon there was a lot of fighting between the audience and me” endon no longer takes out their aggression on bystanders but their caustic blend of power electronics harsh noise gale force hardcore and dissonant metal implies a kind of violence even more foreboding than a stray punch or a whipped microphone with their most recent album through the mirror endon galvanizes their arsenal of ballistic sounds into a streamlined assault on the senses captured by kurt ballou at god city studios through the mirror fuses taro aiko and etsuo nagura’s dual noise barrages koki miyabe’s alternately harrowing guitar work shin yokota’s pummeling drums and taichi’s animalistic howls and shrieks into eight songs that vacillate between molten blocks of viciously constructed metal and chaotic bouts of unbridled auditory hostility through the mirror opens with “nerve rain” an exercise in punishment through repetition with a series of sustained guitar chords being ruthlessly battered beneath blizzard squalls of contactmic distortion piercing modular synth drones and thundering toms it’s a powerful buildup to the explosive fury of “your ghost is dead” wherein the band distills the chaotic energy of ‘s cult hardcore bands like one eyed god prophecy or honeywell and supplements it with added layers of misanthropic scuzz and grit “born in limbo” pits andy ortmannesque sound collages and inhuman vocal manipulations against a backdrop of gothic twang and kinetic drumming side one closes with the double punch of “pensum” and “postsex” where truncated hybrids of hardcore rage and black metal velocity serve as a springboard for taichi’s lyricless communication of the album’s “anti bildungsroman antibuilding romance” concept through guttural bellows and horrific screams if side one serves as an exercise in propulsive unrestrained attacks side two is a study in sustained strategic warfare the spacious crawl of “perversion till death” allows the flanking noise artists to saturate the mix like a hail of fire and stone title track “through the mirror” builds off bedrock of primitive punk and gradually opens the scope of the song with melodic electronics and nagura’s funeral wails sublime desert drones open the finale “torch your house” and guide the band through a nineminute journey of exotic melodicism and triumphant
