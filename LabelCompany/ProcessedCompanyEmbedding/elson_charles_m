corporate governanceralph s saul former chairman  ceo cigna corp abstract this article examines the rapidly escalating public company spinoff phenomenon the authors challenge the conventional wisdom that such activity enhances shareholders value and suggests that it may sometimes have a noncorporate wealth enhancing purpose spinoffs may often be the result of a feedriven investment banking environment or even the product of a chief executive seeking to further personal rather than corporate interests such as delaying a mandatory retirement or removing a potential rival from the organization the authors thus argue that these spinoffs create a number of important corporate governance issues the most significant of which in addition to the fundamental question of whether to spinoff a division at all is the governance structure of the newly spunoff operation the new companys board structure they argue will be vital to assuring both the success of the new venture and the continued health of the parent organization jel classification g suggested citation suggested citation carey dennis c and elson charles m and saul ralph s when a spinoff is on the boards agenda
