of credit on behalf of the company as needed on a  cash collateralized basis although no letter of credit agreement is in place between the company and hang seng bank or any financial institution the last letter of credit placed with hang seng bank on this basis was in may  at march   the company had no outstanding letters of credit in the event that the company does have outstanding letters of credit with hang seng bank a like amount of cash is posted by the company as collateral against such outstanding letters of credit and is classified as restricted cash on the balance sheet shortterm liquidity the companys principal existing sources of cash are generated from operations the company believes that its cash on hand and existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support its existing operations over the next  months historically a significant percentage of the companys product sales were made under the direct import program the direct importation of product by the company to its customers can significantly benefit the companys liquidity because this inventory does not need to be financed by the company in fiscal  however there were no product sales imported directly to the companys customers due to changes in the companys key customers as of march   there were no capital expenditure or other commitments other than the normal purchase orders used to secure product as described above the companys license agreement with funai was terminated by funai effective on december   this event has had a material impact on the companys business financial condition results of operations and cash position the company is analyzing the impacts to its business of these events and is identifying strategic courses of action for consideration offbalance sheet arrangements as of march   the company did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined under the rules of the securities and exchange commission critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted within the united states the preparation of the companys financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses management considers certain accounting policies related to inventories trade accounts receivables impairment of longlived assets valuation of deferred tax assets sales return reserves and sales allowance accruals to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each revenue recognition revenues from product distribution are recognized at the time title passes to the customer under the direct import program title passes in the country of origin under the domestic program title passes primarily at the time of shipment estimates for possible returns are based upon historical return rates and netted against revenues except in connection with infrequent sales with specific arrangements to the contrary returns are not permitted unless the goods are defective in addition to the distribution of products the company grants licenses for the right to use the companys trademarks for a stated term for the manufacture andor sale of consumer electronics and other products under agreements which require payment of either i a nonrefundable minimum guaranteed royalty or ii the greater of the actual royalties due based on a contractual calculation normally comprised of actual product sales by the licensee multiplied by a stated royalty rate or sales royalties or a minimum guaranteed royalty amount in the case of i such amounts are recognized as revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the license agreement in the case of ii sales royalties in excess of guaranteed minimums are accounted for as variable fees and are not recognized as revenue until the company has ascertained that the licensees sales of products have exceeded the guaranteed minimum in effect the company recognizes the greater of sales royalties earned to date or the straightline amount of minimum guaranteed royalties to date in the case where a royalty is paid to the company in advance the royalty payment is initially recorded as a liability and recognized as revenue as the royalties are deemed to be earned according to the principles outlined above inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is determined using the firstin firstout basis the company records inventory reserves to reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory reserves may be required conversely if market conditions improve such reserves are reduced trade accounts receivable the company extends credit based upon evaluations of a customers financial condition and provides for any anticipated credit losses in the companys financial statements based upon managements estimates and ongoing reviews of recorded allowances if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates resulting in an impairment of that customers ability to make payments additional reserves may be required conversely reserves are reduced to reflect credit and collection improvements income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the amount of its deferred tax assets to the amount that management estimates is more likely than not to be realized while management considers future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event that management determines that a deferred tax asset will likely be realized in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise if it is determined that all or part of a net deferred tax asset will likely not be realized in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made sales return reserves management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue management analyzes historical returns current economic trends and changes in customer demand for our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales return reserves in any accounting period additional reserves may be required if actual sales returns increase above the historical return rates conversely the sales return reserve could be decreased if the actual return rates are less than the historical return rates which were used to establish the reserve sales allowance and marketing support accruals sales allowances marketing support programs promotions and other volumebased incentives which are provided to retailers and distributors are accounted for on an accrual basis as a reduction to net revenues in the

accounting standards update  business combinations topic  clarifying the definition of a business issued january  under the current implementation guidance in topic  there are three elements of a businessinputs processes and outputs while an integrated set of assets and activities collectively referred to as a set that is a business usually has outputs outputs are not required to be present in addition all the inputs and processes that a seller uses in operating a set are not required if market participants can acquire the set and continue to produce outputs for example by integrating the acquired set with their own inputs and processes the amendments in this update provide a screen to determine when a set is not a business the screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets the set is not a business this screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated if the screen is not met the amendments in this update  require that to be considered a business a set must include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and  remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements the amendments provide a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present the framework includes two sets of criteria to consider that depend on whether a set has outputs although outputs are not required for a set to be a business outputs generally are a key element of a business therefore the board has developed more stringent criteria for sets without outputs lastly the amendments in this update narrow the definition of the term output so that the term is consistent with how outputs are described in topic  public business entities should apply the amendments in this update to annual periods beginning after december   including interim periods within those periods the company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements accounting standards update  statement of cash flows topic  restricted cash issued november  the amendments in this update require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents therefore amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginningofperiod and endofperiod total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows the amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years the company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements accounting standards update  consolidation topic  interests held through related parties that are under common control issued october  this update amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity vie should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that vie the amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years the company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements accounting standards update  income taxes topic  intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory issued october  this update amends current gaap which prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intraentity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party to require entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs consequently the amendments in this update eliminate the exception for an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory the amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual reporting periods the company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements accounting standards update  statement of cash flows topic  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments issued august  the amendments in this update provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues  debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs  settlement of zerocoupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing  contingent consideration payments made after a business combination  proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims  proceeds from the settlement of corporateowned life insurance policies including bankowned life insurance policies  distributions received from equity method investees  beneficial interests in securitization transactions and accounting standards update  financial instruments  credit losses topic  measurement of credit losses on financial instruments issued june  the amendments in this update require a financial asset or a group of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset the income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period the measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events including historical experience
