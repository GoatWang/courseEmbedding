  kulabrands is dedicated to locating unique inventions that are looking for a way to get manufactured and find channels of distribution by leveraging its community of members to bring these inventions to market successfully kulabrands is the answer that these inventors are looking for   as a homebased business kulabrands sells memberships to those interested in joining the kulabrands opportunity members in turn receive royalties for products they choose to crowdfund promote or sell members also receive royalties on members activity referred by them giving them the power to leverage the kulabrands model   kulabrands™ inc is a new innovative company inspired by the idea of creating a company for the people that radically changes the homebased business model as the brainchild of inventor and businessman peter gantner kulabrands has evolved to a functioning business through the collaboration and committed efforts of our dynamic team and kulabrands community including doug kyle yaan gulledge and cory moran who have brought it all together in addition the successful businessman mr jeff hoffman cofounder pricelinecom is a cofounder board member and spokesperson mr hoffman is quoted as saying “kulabrands is one of the first business models i have ever seen designed right from the ground up”   by developing a business model that utilizes collaboration and fosters innovation and has developed a support mechanism through collaboration kulabrands has built a dynamic synergistic paradigm that has revolutionized a shift in the homebased business kulabrands invites inventors creative artists and entrepreneurs to join forces in a unique patentpending business model to collaborate and launch new products as well as their respective companies   kulabrands business was developed by recognizing and combining several powerful trends crowdfunding social media marketing crowd intelligence work from home movement and the collaborative business structure this is like the perfect storm bringing together most innovative and strongest elements of the trending online market to form what will become most likely the market changing model of the future   by combining collaboration technology and online social networks with communitybased crowdfunding social funding direct sales social selling and social brandingmarketing the products we decide to launch can go beyond the traditional homebased business format to the shelves of the traditional retail marketplace worldwide both off and online   in compliance with our community bill of rights a communityelected kulabrands member will always have a seat on the board of directors this ensures that kulabrands members are represented in every aspect of our business with our business model the kulabrands community inventors and company succeeds together and everyone benefits from everyone else’s success   company overview   kulabrands™ inc the “company” a delaware corporation is a communitybased patentpending business model in the collaborative homebased business space that perpetually rewards its members for supporting inventors and project creators the patent is based on dynamic reverse royalty allocation systems and methods us pat app no which are paid by an inventor or an artist to the kulabrands for supporting them in the three key areas needed to build a successful brandcompany the three areas are social funding rewardbased crowdfunding social brandingmarketing and social selling direct sales these activities are accomplished using proprietary software internet crowdfunding platforms social media sites and community cooperation the company operates kulabrandscom kulafundedcom shopkulacom and kulaforumorg websites and facilitates activities performed by the community members the “community”   the community membership is governed by memberspecific agreements to explain the rights obligations and terms of membership with kulabrands as a communitydriven company the company aims to include the members in the management and operational decisions of kulabrands and welcomes their thoughts and suggestions regarding their agreement members joining the community agree to the terms and conditions of the signed agreement including the compensation plan in addition to receiving reverse royalties mentioned above members joining in  paid a onetime lifetime membership fee of  to join the community currently the lifetime membership fee is    from february   to december   the company signed contracts engaging two inventors and launched two products while the membership count was  as of the date of issuance of the reviewed financials the company has signed contracts with an additional six inventors launched one more product and the membership count increased to  problem what makes kulabrands different   kulabrands difference is our understanding and focus on the kulabrands community we understand that the true power of the model is members of the community we have developed a business model and culture of every activity of each member helps build royalties for themselves as well as other community members we exemplify a rising tide raise all ships  our belief is that collaborative business models are the future of modern society   challenges of crowdfunding   even before an idea is launched on a crowdfunding platform many inventors have already spent a great deal of time and often a significant sum of money on writing video production graphic design and prototype development once a project is approved by crowdfunding sites such as kickstarter or indiegogo and the inventor has specified a fundraising goal the hope is that enough people will make a pledge or back the project to help the inventor achieve that goal however only a few projects reach their goal as illustrated below     building a community before listing on a crowdfunding platform is the most powerful key to success knowing exactly who is committed to pledging on the project during the first day that it goes “live” and leveraging social capital increases chances of success solution why companies need kulabrands’ services   branding and marketing are among the top most costly expenses for a business development of a company’s messaging logo design and how a consumer interacts with those aspects of the business requires preparation and expertise entrepreneurs often grossly underestimate how much time and money is required to market a product effectively before the days of the internet the traditional model of branding and marketing looked like the image below     many of those classic marketing methods are still in use today and at very high costs to the entrepreneur or business owner these days we have internet marketing social media marketing and now kulabrands   how kulabrands helps inventors succeed   the kulabrands patentpending business model provides a unique opportunity to build business relationships kulabrands provides a readymade active community that supports the inventor known as prepledging kulabrands community members always vote on every project prepledging determines how many members are interested in backing a project once it is posted on a crowdfunding website not every member will be interested in every project if there are enough votes in favor of the project the business owner or inventor can be assured that they have enough backing “social capital” to reach their funding goal within  hours of going live on the crowdfunding platform the inventor now has money as well as the continued support of the kulabrands community once the project leaves the crowdfunding platform and is launched into the mass marketplace   kulabrands leverages social platforms to drive sales   social selling simply means using the internet’s social media platforms to create brand awareness and to drive product sales because kulabrands begins driving online sales immediately after a crowdfunding project closes the creator or inventor is able to preserve capital in the business just when heshe needs it most—at startup kulabrands also helps increase income for the inventor at a time when sales are historically slow—at startup each kulabrands member has hisher own sales portal website dedicated to the sale of products from kulabrandssupported projects all initial sales take place online and can be shipped right from the inventor’s own business location   top reasons inventors work with kulabrands   kulabrands is a complete solution to inventors it provides development funds working capital via reward based crowdfunding revenue via direct sales and social branding and marketing this complete solution is provided without selling any equity in their business another key reason is the kulabrands model helps reduce the cost of performing the previuos mentioned activeties this allows better utilization of availible capitial improving the chance of success for the business business owners and inventors can enjoy the following benefits when partnering with kulabrands   achievement  traction   inventors teamed with kulabrands   zip n store the first communitysupported project to launch on kickstarter reached the  campaign goal within  minutes reaching a total of  in pledges and  overgoal funding zip n store was one of the most successful products ever to be on kickstarter currently there are eight additional products backed by the community in various stages of funding park smarts for kids reached a  overgoal funding on kickstarter in december  mobicardusa with a  funding and the freedom charger with a  funding were successful campaigns on indiegogo two projects the easy breezy messenger bag and the trifecto infinity pen are presently active campaigns on kickstarter with pledges over  the messenger bag has more than doubled its goal of  the trifecto pen surpassed its  goal with over  in pledges  of goal   gunbail is an active campaign on indiegogo which has exceeded its  goal   a brief description of each project supported by kulabrands community members is provided below       longterm branding recognition   the kulabrands supported product seal represents products and services launched by the support of the kulabrands collaborative community the seal further represents that a purchase of this product helps improve the financial future of everyday people     market   market overview   the kulabrands model operates in a wide range of markets these being product incubator crowdfunding homebased business global retail market online platform and social media marketing these are having growth on a yearly basis kulabrands is also on the leading forefront of collaborative business movement this business model allows for more people to participation and benefit from the success of the business   market size   entrepreneurs launching new projects needing help estimated  plus each year projects unsuccessful crowdfunded on top platform estimated  in last  years people in homebased business worldwide market estimated at  plus people in  global retail market place – estimated at    target market   inventors looking to bring their product to the market who need help in the development funding and all other aspects of building a successful company fulltimeparttime employees entrepreneurs retirees looking to develop additional income working from home on a part time bases   direct sales   shopkulacom is the platform built to sell all products supported by kulabrands as well we will be using amazoncom ebaycom and other thirdparty sites to generate direct sales community members wanting to build additional income using online social selling direct sales to subsidize income and retirement   competition   competitive advantage   the strength of our community patent pending business model the ability for all members to generate income without having to recruit no auto ship program no money paid out for recruiting collective intelligence of members   future products and services   future projects and brands for kulabrands are open to technology publishing food and spices design automotive music and film services and many others kulabrands uses collective intelligence of the community to decide which projects are launched the kulabrands community represents a crosssection of the of the global retail community currently we have over  products in different stages of development to be presented to the community   milestones   business model   key operational process   the kulabrands business model covers three critical success factors that a company needs to become profitable without these three things a product will not survive in the market place crowdfunding assistance through the rewardbased crowdfunding process kulabrands helps inventors and entrepreneurs obtain capital to manufacture and launch their product branding and marketing kulabrands provides social media marketing services to build trust and brand awareness advertising and sales the kulabrands community leverages the power of the internet to help promote and drive sales for all products that are supported by kulabrands       whenever a kulabrandssupported product makes a sale anywhere in the world kulabrands members earn a reverse royalty if they supported that product in at least one of the three kulabrands pools kulabrands also offers a onetime fee to join the community—that is a lifetime membership with no monthly fees or auto ship requirements the unique business model provides a bill of rights that truly gives the community set rights within the company and with the community additionally kulabrands reserved a seat on the board of directors for an elected community member because we believe it is important for community members to be involved in every aspect of our business kulabrands is truly a parttime business model where on a couple hours a week of time over the course of  years people can build a substantial residual income there is no requirement to recruit and although that aspect is available it is not necessary for a person to create and build a residual income       in addition to using our own community to generate revenue in their contacts and connections we also leverage existing systems and existing distribution channels to distribute inventor products so in the early stages kulabrands is the one driving and creating sales for those products as we move forward our goal is to use much bigger distribution channels which in turn allows us to have a much larger number of the community making large incomes as well as everyone generating some income monthly   funding is dramatically more accessible through the mechanism of rewardbased crowdfunding relevant market exposure is achieved by a hybrid of our engaged community members and our own atwill automated social media publishing software sales revenue is driven by our highly incentivized community of influencers through tried and true affiliate commission programs using high converting sales pages as well as word of mouth advertising for success in both on and offline sales channels with these three aspects working in concert we can use the  billion direct sales industry to leverage the power of the  trillion global retail market and develop these projects into international brands   today’s technology facilitates greater individual social reach and leverage which when used to its full advantage provides a blue ocean of opportunity in which our members can monetize their activity making it easier faster and more likely for a project to have a successful launch into the marketplace   royalties are one of the ideal revenue sources in the world however until now royalties have been available only to a small segment of the population the kulabrands business model makes that income accessible to anyone with access to the internet and opens an opportunity for largescale collaboration generating royalty income for the people who need it most team   management team   the kulabrands management team is a collaboration of experience and talent encompassing many areas expertise they are entrepreneurs ceos business men and women mothers and fathers grandparents and teachers to name just a few together they are dedicated and committed to changing lives around the world and making kulabrands the greatest company and community for anyone desiring true residual income peter gantner is personally committed to making the world a better

significant risk and it is likely you may lose all or part of your investment you should only invest an amount that you are willing to lose and should build a diversified portfolio to spread risk if a business you invest in fails neither the company  nor trucrowd  will pay you back your investment  risk of lack of liquidity liquidity is the ease with which you can sell your shares after you have purchased them buying shares in businesses pitching through trucrowd cannot be sold easily as they are unlikely to be listed on a secondary trading market such as nasdaq amex or the new york stock exchange even successful companies rarely list shares on such an exchange in addition if you purchase b investment shares these are nonvoting shares and may not be attractive to potential buyers without a public market to find a buyer for shares it may be more difficult to sell them investment in crowdfunding assets should be viewed as a long term and illiquid investment current rules state you must generally keep any purchased shares at least twelve months from the acquisition date  risk of rarity of dividends dividends are payments made by a business to its shareholders from the companys profits most of the companies seeking financing via equity crowdfunding are startups or early stage companies and these companies will rarely pay dividends to their investors profits are typically reinvested into the business to fuel growth and build shareholder value businesses have no obligation to pay shareholder dividends  risk of possibility of dilution any investment made through equity crowdfunding may be subject to dilution in the future dilution occurs when a company issues more shares dilution affects every existing shareholder who does not buy any of the new shares being issued as a result an existing shareholders proportionate shareholding of the company is reduced or diluted this has an effect on a number of things including voting dividends and value some businesses who pitch through equity crowdfunding offer seed shares which may include preemption rights that protect an investor from dilution in this situation the business must give shareholders with seed shares the opportunity to buy additional shares during a subsequent fundraising round so that they can maintain or preserve their shareholding please research the pitch and the articles of the company to see if the shares you are buying will have these preemption rights  risk of the need for investment diversification diversification consists of spreading your money across multiple investments to lessen your investment risk unfortunately while diversifying is a crucial part of investing it will not reduce every type of risk you should only invest a portion of your available investment funds through trucrowd and balance your trucrowd investment with safer more liquid investments please note that diversification does not assure a profit or provide a guarantee against investment loss investing in startups and earlystage businesses involve risks including illiquidity lack of dividends loss of investment and dilution if you choose to invest in businesses displayed on this portal you need to be aware and accept that  you should invest money you can afford to lose  the stock purchased is restricted that is such asset is highly illiquid  even if the business is successful you might not receive any cash return on your investment for years  ordinary events in the life of the firm can cause your ownership percentage to decline and  investments in earlystage companies should be done only under a larger investment plan whereby the vast majority of the capital is placed in safer more liquid assets you only will be allowed to invest with trucrowd after you

word about the scientific breakthrough and excellent products expand distributionsales networks to handle sales growth and underwrite rd of new products for randy’s remedy and strategic partnerships investors should consider grs a stepping stone in today’s rapidly evolving regulatory environment to a global st century business grs the strause group is family operated founded by linda tyler and brendon strause in memory of their husband and father george randall strause problem when randy strause was diagnosed with glioblastoma an incurable brain cancer he used medical marijuana but was concerned about the side effects and legal risk of thc the need was apparent for an overthecounter product with some of the same benefits of medical marijuana but in a safe natural nontoxic nonintoxicating consistent quality measurable legal and without stigma currently products containing cannabinoids are either available by prescription only have longterm health complications andor struggle in the state by state medicinal marijuana mmj marketplaces grs was formed to navigate and capitalize on the legal regulatory and social changes surrounding hemp health products with a single goal from the beginning “to create the products we wished we had when our fatherhusband was alive” solution grs has entered the multibillion dollar complementary and alternative medicine cam market with the randy’s remedy powered by cannaka line of products contains cannaka a botanically complete hemp ingredient rich in naturally occurring cannabinoids found beneficial by customers from all walks of life dealing with a wide range of inflammatory and mood disorders supports the central nervous system works with the body to promote a healthy inflammatory response nontoxic nonintoxicating scientifically formulated utilizing the whole plant plus terpenes a scientific breakthrough that engages the endocannabinoid system ecs the largest system of “neuromodulators” in the body binding to

topical products available as drops as a soothing deepacting skin lotion and as a new product randy’s companion for pets compliant with state and federal guidelines for sale in all  states pioneering development and sales of the highest quality hemp based nutraceuticals for mainstream consumption poised to be a leader in the rapidly growing cam market scalable as the consumer public is educated to its advantages sales grow and new applications are introduced developing relationships in the biopharma industries to develop ipprotected technology achievement  traction since grss inception in april  we have steadily built a foundation upon which to launch a major national brand at first we relied on consulting contracts to sustain the company and cultivate relationships with our customers to learn more about them and our products today we have a solid supply chain of raw material from domestic sources and international sources as needed we have the capabilities to expand our packaging and distribution to quickly ramp up production to k unitsmonth and beyond as demand requires   we have adeptly applied the limited marketing funds available to create content for social media and our customers we consistently rate higher than the national average for click rate open rate and conversions from our last biannual website report we beat the national average in almost all the categories here is a link to that biannual report   there is genuine excitement in the marketplace for this product we will continue our marketing effort and expand it as the business grows continually monitoring our metrics we will bolster the most successful content channels we will expand our wholesale distribution network and are implementing an affiliate marketing program we also plan to increase sales by reaching out to health and wellness professionals and their professional organizations small to medium size retail stores and by forming strategic alliances with other health and dietary brands market in an emerging market there are few ways to estimate market size our first research looked at the cam market we worked with cr insights a strategic market research firm to determine the potential market for randy’s remedy while the whole cam market is a byear market and growing we were able to identify a more targeted initial market in which randy’s remedy would be successful there are over  million adults with the requisite disposable income in the us struggling with inflammation psoriasis or seizures these three conditions alone account for over b of the cam marketplace we have chosen these to focus on because the benefits are visible and the customer is able to feel the benefits quickly another way to look at the potential is by analyzing the growing mmj and adultuse marijuana markets the market research shows how consumers are changing their minds regarding cannabinoid products randys remedy products address many of the concerns for people who are wary of these types of products randys remedy products are nonsmoking nonintoxicating consistent and reproducible able to capitalize on the public’s growing acceptance of hemp products competition while keeping in mind the challenges in launching a product in this emerging industry there are a few direct competitors selling hempbased nutritional products some of these competing companies are larger in size and have financial resources greater than grs however we believe that randy’s remedy products are the only “botanically complete” ones currently on the market have the highest quality and offer many advantages over the competition see “solution” above the following are five  such competitors that grs has identified dixie botanicals dixie botanicals is an established company that delivers hemp oil products the company sells a variety of hemp oil products with various levels of potency its products sell for between  and  depending on the particular product and content  real

are greater in size or have greater financial resources than grs other products competitive with randy’s remedy are products under the cam umbrella these natural products have the same marketing and advertising regulations as randy’s remedy and other natural products business model our business model is simple we manage our supply chain to keep costs down while delivering an exceptional product both direct to consumer and through select retail or health professional storefront locations    although we are yet to show a profit we believe that with additional resources we will increase sales and soon cross the profit threshold and enhance the company’s valuation we are experiencing  month over month increase in sales our margins are currently at  wholesale and  direct to consumer and we don’t expect that to change in the near future our objectives are to sell more product continue utilizing the subscription model to retain our customers and make randy’s remedy an authority for hemp health products    due to the uncertainty and growth of this market we are also developing relationships in the biopharma market to develop ipprotected technology this technology may be licensed to
