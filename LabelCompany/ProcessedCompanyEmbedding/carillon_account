adopted carillonsacrécoeur as the national flag of french canadians very quickly other committees were set up throughout french canada from quebec northern ontario to new brunswick to promote it nationalist circles were seeking to acquire a distinctive sign to replace the french tricolor the flag of france which was very popular among frenchcanadians in the th century the carillonsacrécoeur was a great success and is deployed in most major patriotic events throughout the first half of the th century as elsewhere in ontario in the center of the carillonsacrécoeur flag you can see the sacred heart wearing a crown of thorns surmounted by a cross and surrounded by a garland of maple leaves the blue background is in reference to our lady the banner is crossed with a white cross and features to all over the lily symbol of the french monarchy and also of our lady as you can see there is tremendous catholicchristian imagery within the flag this catholic identity was very strong and very much a part of french canadians lives – david gilbert   size sm md lg xl xxl xxxl  select options add to my wishlist compare ultra soft crusader tshirt  quick view ultra soft crusader tshirt  the
