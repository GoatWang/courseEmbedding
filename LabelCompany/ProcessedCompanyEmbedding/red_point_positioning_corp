accessing the rtls basestation rbs provides systemwide knowledge of all of the infrastructure and tags realtime and historical data is  available the primary interface for communicating with the rtls server is based on industry standard representational state transfer rest calls this allows thirdparty code to get and set various parameters within the rtls system with a minimum of code using common http queries for example it is a simple matter to query the system for radio nodes seen within a given timeinterval for lowlatency applications the rbs also provides a publicationsubscription
