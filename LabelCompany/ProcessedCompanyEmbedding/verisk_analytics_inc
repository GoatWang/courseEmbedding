solutionsjul  about verisk analytics vrsk donovan jones ipos tech alternative investments ceo venturedealcomventuredealsummaryverisk analytics intends to acquire g web services for  million in cashg has created unique data sets that assist financial firms in detecting bad actors fraudulent activity and remaining in regulatory compliancethe acquisition will be combined with argus verisks financial analytics and compliance business and is a continuation of verisk active ma strategy quick take data analytics company verisk analytics vrsk has announced an agreement to acquire g web services for  million in an all cash deal g has developed technologies that assist payment processors in determining merchant risk for prospective and existing merchants the deal promises to combine g’s unique data sets with verisk’s argus unit to provide financial institutions with improved fraud badactor detection and compliance requirements target company bellevue washingtonbased g was founded in  to create merchant risk management technologies for due diligence ongoing compliance and fraud protection purposes management is headed by allison guidette who has been with the company since  and previously held senior positions at thomson reuters and merrill corporation below is a brief demo video about g’s approach to kyc processes for commercial banks source g web services g has developed a robust partner network which includes the following groups source g web services little is known about g’s investment history other than a seed financing round was disclosed in  from investor primus capital acquisition terms and rationale verisk said it would pay  million in cash to g’s stockholders and that the deal is expected to close in q  as of verisk’s march   q the company had  million in cash and equivalents and total liabilities of  billion it’s operating cash flow for q  totaled  million even after repaying  million of shortterm debt verisk will presumably take on debt to close the current transaction although management did not provide any details on how it intends to pay for g upon closing g will be integrated into verisk’s argus business so that as g’s ceo allison guidette stated by joining with argus we will take our proprietary data assets powerful technology and deep domain expertise to the next level in helping clients fight fraud transaction laundering and reputational risk within the global payments and ecommerce ecosystem together we will expand our capabilities to map badactor networks predict payments risk and provide clients with the best opportunity to reduce losses and fines due to merchant and business fraud and compliance violations italics mine so the key for the new combination is to integrate g’s unique data sets with argus’ risk forecasting and regulatory platforms to help financial institutions better avoid payment fraud and badactors via the kyc requirements as well as remain in regulatory compliance throughout the process the rise of fraud through the global financial system represents a threat to the security and ongoing business operations of financial firms as this  global fraud report by kroll described risks have only increased in the few years since that report the  report chart below shows the numerous categories of fraud and the percentage of companies affected or vulnerable and the numbers have probably risen since then source kroll global fraud report  the acquisition promises to bolster verisk’s argus unit’s capabilities to use unique data sets to help combat financial system fraud as data becomes ever more important to the integrity of the financial system the deal makes sense as verisk continues on its busy acquisition pace i write about ma deals public companies that invest in technology startups

abercrombie abandons sale how emerging brands care against established leaders in google search hedge fund demand rises as fee structure changes as earnings drop to lowest since  verisk analytics began its operations in  as insurance services offices iso a nonprofit enterprise started by pc insurers to collect industry data and information that was used by its sponsors to determine premium rates underwrite risk develop products and report to regulators basically acting as a cost center for the pc industry  the entity expanded into analytics with its acquisitions of american insurance services in  and the national insurance crime bureau in  which brought expertise in claims fraud detection and prevention before converting to a forprofit organization in  and going public in  as verisk iso became whollyowned subsidiary of verisk  the company acquired a bunch of companies from its iso days to today bolstering its core insurance risk assessment services and expanding into new industry verticals verisk’s decadeslong legacy as the central repository of pc industry data is the heart and soul of its competitive advantage and has served as the foundation on which all its other offerings have been built over the years  it is difficult to overstate the critical role that verisk plays in pricing claims management and administrative efficiency across the pc industry  for instance verisk analytics sets the de facto industry standard on language – “courttested” and found in mn of the mn policies issued in the us – used in policy forms sold to insurers via subscription that ensures consumers are getting the same amount of coverage for the same quote across insurers the company sits at the center of a network that procures data from a wide variety of sources claims settlements remote imagery auto oems analyzes it and delivers predictive insights to clients insurers advertisers property managers  the agreements through which a customer licenses vrsk’s data also allows the company to make use of that customer’s data…so essentially the customer pays verisk for a solution that costs almost nothing for the company to deliver and verisk gets to use that customer’s data to enhance its own solutions which improved solutions reduce churn and attract even more customers and their data in a subsidized feedback loop  this flywheel built on top of verisk’s historical advantage as the repository of industry data has generated world’s largest claims database vrsk aggregates claims data from  of the pc industry containing granular information on bn claims up from mn claims in  with the insurance ecosystem submitting k new claims a day across all pc coverage lines  it would be effectively impossible for a competitor to replicate this everburgeoning flurry of data aside vrsk’s spending on public clouds has dramatically escalated over the last few years allowing the company to not only realize considerable cost savings without public clouds it would have been far more costly for verisk to secure engagements with european retail banks who operate under strict privacy laws that require data to reside within the country of origin and flexibility as its datasets continue to expand in girth and complexity but to also apply machine learning to those datasets and enable new functionality to its services comprehensive data paired with a decent model generates better insights than limited data paired with a great model  an insurer that relies solely on inhouse claims experience cannot underwrite risks with nearly the same degree of accuracy as one with access to the entire industry’s data  consider all the vehicle ratings variables – make  model location where the car is garaged down to one of k census blocks mileage driver’s record semiautonomous  safety features in the vehicle – that vrsk accounts for in assessing loss costs on  iso series cars cars that are part of the iso ratings series used to match premiums to type of car  or the construction costs – from roofing material to drywall to electrical and hvac contractor rates – monitored across  regions across north america and updated monthly using verisk’s xactimate software which insurers use to quantify replacement costs including labor and material costs within k unitcost line items in the event of a claim and compare computed insurancetovalue estimates to those submitted by brokers at the beginning of the underwriting process  a contractor who shows up to a damaged home after a storm can leverage the mn price points stored in verisk’s database estimate a policy claim and then share that information with the policyholder adjuster and the claims department  like verisk’s policy forms xactimate too is an industry standard used to estimate nearly  of all personal property claims in the us data is further leveraged to improve efficiency and the frontend experience of insureds  for instance per one case study a large auto insurer typically spent  minutes walking a policy seeker through its sales funnel an initial question quote inquiry that transitioned to processing where  of qualified leads had their initial quotes changed and finally to binding with lead leakage at each step along the way ultimately translating into a conversion rate of just   with verisk’s lightspeed the insurer spent less than a minute on the sales process and doubled its conversions  by sifting through a deluge of mn transactions per month pulled from odometer readings vehicle reports and claims loss history verisk only needs a few pieces of information from the customer upfront to arrive at the right price within seconds at the point of quote with claims settlements absorbing  of the bn of premiums collected by the us pc industry every year not to mention the bnbn of fraudulent auto injury claims and the industry as a whole generating negligible underwriting margins over time solutions that improve operating efficiency improve sales outcomes and accurately estimate the industry’s largest expense item are obviously critical  verisk’s products are tightly integrated into customers’ workflows and consumed as subscriptions subscriptions represent  of the company’s revenue  is the transformed data proprietary  check  are the insights from the data critical  check  does the data fuel a feedback loop that deepens the data moat  check vrsk has a nice moat in the pc vertical  but of course the best companies not only have dominant competitive advantages around their existing business but also huge advantaged growth opportunities and it is here i’m afraid that prospects look bleaker  here are what management sees as its growth opportunities crossselling selling existing products to new customers and introducing new products to existing ones  this is the most compelling opportunity from a probabilityofsuccess standpoint and has motivated much of the recurring tuckin acquisitions made by the company over the years  over the last several years the company has reoriented how it approaches the customer moving away from a siloe’d approach to product sales to integrated teams most of the company’s sales to insurers are bundled products that improve customer stickiness      view full page tags verisk analytics vrsk load comments send us your tips at tipsatvaluewalkcom latest news from valuewalkwill i
