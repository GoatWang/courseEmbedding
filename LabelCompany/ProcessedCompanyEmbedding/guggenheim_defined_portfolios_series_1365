compromises by charles rotblut cfa definedmaturity funds are hybrid funds designed to bridge one of the biggest gaps between traditional bond funds and individual funds as the name implies definedmaturity bonds cease their existence on a specified date at maturity investors receive a distribution equivalent to the fund’s net asset value these funds are intended to be a solution for investors who desire certainty over the timing of cash flows or wish to stagger their interest rate exposure but do not want to invest in individual bonds since these are funds however they come with compromises that should be understood and considered before purchase the complexities lie not only in the structure of the funds themselves but also in the differences between bonds and bond funds understanding how these two differ helps to better understand the role definedmaturity funds can play in a portfolio in this article i discuss the differences between individual bonds and definedmaturity funds i then compare and contrast the offerings from the only three firms i was able to identify as currently offering definedmaturity funds fidelity guggenheim and ishares i also include realworld examples of monthly and final distributions sidebar boxes here and here bonds versus bond funds the underlying premise for definedmaturity bonds lies in the key differences between bonds and bond funds maturity versus perpetuity bonds cease to exist at maturity while bond funds are designed to last into perpetuity the difference affects the return of capital an investor can expect at the time he makes an investment bond maturity a bond is essentially a loan to a corporation or government entity a bond promises its owner a set amount of interest payments and full payment of the note’s balance—typically  in the us—on a specified date the maturity date these characteristics enable an investor to determine the amount and timing of cash flows he will receive for a traditional bond the issuer will pay a set amount of interest and at maturity will pay the par value of  unless the issuer defaults these are set amounts for traditional noncallable bonds this is why bonds are described as providing return of capital thanks to this characteristic an investor can calculate his future return based on his purchase price and the prevailing yield as long as he holds the bond to maturity a bond fund whether it is a mutual fund an exchangetraded fund etf or a closedend fund cef is a managed portfolio of bonds a fund’s manager invests in a number of bonds meeting the criteria specified by the fund’s objective should a bond mature the fund manager will typically reinvest the proceeds in a new bond quite often bonds are sold from the portfolio before maturity as the fund manager seeks to manage yield duration a bond’s or a portfolio’s sensitivity to interest rate changes diversification and security selection more importantly the typical bond fund is designed to last into perpetuity in order to realize the return of their invested capital shareholders must sell their shares at prevailing prices since the price of the shares fluctuates there is no approximate dollar amount investors can plan on receiving in the future the distributions paid by a bond fund also fluctuate depending on the composition of the portfolio and how the manager changes the holdings in response to shifting market conditions and interest rate expectations it is very possible to realize a loss of capital with a bond fund if interest rates rise between the time an investor purchases and sells the bond fund the fund’s share price may drop in value causing a loss for the investor potentially offsetting this decrease are the distributions paid by the fund the change in the fund’s yield the portfolio decisions made by the fund manager and the length of time the investor holds the bond fund bond liquidity bond funds hold a key advantage in terms of bond purchasing power though us bonds have a par value of  they typically trade in far larger quantities a round lot of municipal bonds is  an individual investor can find bonds trading in smaller lots such as  but as the size of the transaction decreases in dollar amount so do the choices of bonds available for purchase it can also be more difficult to sell smaller lots of bonds than it is to sell larger lots anytime the pool of wouldbe buyers or sellers shrinks the opportunity for mispricing increases fund managers conversely have the ability to buy and sell large blocks of bonds this gives them a greater selection of bonds and the ability to interact with a bigger range of buyers and sellers plus since fund managers work with professional traders they can get better pricing and lower transaction costs variance in monthly distributions due to the short history of definedmaturity bond funds there is not a large amount of data showing how stable or variable the monthly distributions are ishares’ first definedmaturity etf the ishares  sp amtfree municipal term etf muaa does provide an example however   the fund was launched on january   and the first distribution was made on february   the fund terminated in august  monthly distributions for the exchangetraded fund ranged from  to  per month the august  distribution was  per share the table below which is based on data from ishares shows the variance in monthly distributions at the fund’s termination investors received a final distribution of  per share which was above the fund’s initial net asset value of  this amount was left off the chart to better show the changes in the monthly distributions any variance in monthly distributions will depend on several factors including how a fund is managed and whether or not changes are made in its portfolio thus while this table gives a realworld example of what happened with one specific fund the variance from other definedmaturity funds including those offered by ishares may differ investors preferring more stability in the cash payouts may want to consider an actual bond ladder instead a ladder of individual bonds will provide an investor with a steady stream of income payments as long as the bonds have not matured no defaults occur or no reinvestments are made the definedmaturity fund solution definedmaturity funds seek to strike a middle ground between bonds and bond funds like bonds these funds mature on a specified date and return the capital to shareholders like bond funds they are professionally managed and benefit from the economies of scale that a large portfolio offers definedmaturity funds mature during the year listed in their names for example the fidelity municipal income  fund fmlcx will mature on june   shortly after this date the fund will return its proceeds to shareholders this is an important distinction from most target date funds which continue their existence after the year in their names are reached for more information about target date funds see “target date funds a simple premise but underlying complexities” in the october  aaii journal a big advantage of the termination dates is the ability to manage interest rate risk an investor can build the equivalent of a bond ladder by investing in definedmaturity funds with different maturity dates this allows him to stagger his exposure to changing interest rates instead of relying on forecasts that may or may not prove to be correct definedmaturity funds are actual funds investors buy shares in a fund that holds a portfolio of bonds maturing around a specified date within the limitations specified in the objective the fund manager has the ability to adjust the portfolio including replacing funds bonds may also be added to or removed from the portfolio in reaction to purchases or redemptions from shareholders this means investors are not buying into a static portfolio of bonds that are held until maturity but rather are purchasing a managed portfolio that evolves up until its maturity date since these are actual funds investors get the advantages of active management and effective buying power the fund managers have access to the expertise of bond analysts and bond traders to assist with decisions regarding credit quality valuation and bond selection they also have access to a larger amount of data than the typical individual investor has and are better equipped to assess the attributes of bonds from municipalities or businesses an individual investor may not be familiar with the traders a fund uses have a better understanding of the market and can get more favorable pricing plus due to the sheer amount of dollars available to invest a fund’s portfolio is often more diversified than what most individual investors could create for themselves by buying bonds of similar maturities the disadvantage of course is that these are actively managed funds shareholders are reliant on the decisions of the fund manager and his team if a fund manager makes poor bond choices or trades in a manner that creates taxable events shareholders are adversely affected furthermore the cumulative expenses paid by a shareholder may be more than the commissions paid for individual bonds how definedmaturity bond funds work definedmaturity bond funds hold a portfolio of bonds set to mature near the fund’s expiration date the bonds held by the fund can be replaced in the years leading up to the maturity date at the manager’s discretion such trades could occur if a bond is called the credit outlook changes inflows or outflows from the fund alter the cash balance or other similar reasons as such it is possible for these types of funds to generate capital gains or losses for shareholders holding them in a taxable account near the specified termination date the fund will be liquidated and the proceeds will be distributed to shareholders at that time the fund will cease to exist investors wishing to access their investment dollars sooner can sell their shares in the fund prior to the expiration date the termination date of the fund will be listed in the prospectus the guggenheim bulletshares  corporate bond etf bsce “will terminate on or about december  ” notice the terminology used the maturity dates listed for these funds are not exact and the maturity dates of the bonds held by these funds are not identical rather the bonds held in these funds mature within a certain window of time leading up to the termination date of the fund as bonds mature in the final year of the fund the proceeds may be invested in cash equivalent securities guggenheim’s funds have the option of holding us treasury bills and investmentgrade commercial paper fidelity’s funds may hold money market securities the ishares funds may hold money market funds affiliated with blackrock fund advisors amtfree taxexempt municipal notes variable rate demand notes and obligations tender option bonds and municipal commercial paper as the transition to these cash equivalent securities is made the fund’s yield will likely drop this would particularly occur in the final months of a fund’s intended lifespan with the intent of the fund’s assets entirely consisting of cash by the termination date at termination the fund’s balance is distributed to shareholders less any final expenses withheld from the balance this amount may be more or less than what a particular shareholder paid for the shares fidelity maintains the right to close its definedmaturity funds to new shareholders the company includes language in its prospectus to the effect that it also anticipates closing its definedmaturity funds to new purchases both by prospective and current shareholders during the month period leading up to fund’s maturity date because ishares and guggenheim funds are etfs they never close to new investors shares in their funds are purchased on the open market instead of directly from the fund sponsor as is the case with the fidelity funds tax issues if any of the funds are purchased in a taxable account an investor may be liable for both income and capital gains taxes distributions from the guggenheim and the ishares corporate bond definedmaturity etfs are subject to federal taxes the distributions from the fidelity and the ishares municipal bond funds will be largely exempt from federal taxes though the prospectuses caution that some taxable income may also be distributed since these funds are designed to be taxfriendly any distribution of taxable income should be a small amount of overall income distributions these characteristics make the fidelity and the ishares municipal bond funds more suitable for taxable accounts and the guggenheim and the ishares corporate funds more suitable for traditional iras roth iras and similar accounts capital gains distributions are a possibility from all definedmaturity funds this would occur if a bond was sold at a profit in the portfolio shortterm capital distributions even from the municipal bond funds would be taxed at ordinary income taxes longterm capital gains would qualify for the more favorable tax rate capital gain tax liabilities could also be created if the fund shares are sold before the termination date or at the time when final proceeds are received if longterm capital gains are realized by a fund and distributed to shareholders the investor would have to pay taxes—as would be the case with distributions from another type of mutual fund or etf eg a stock fund at the termination date a shareholder could realize either a capital gain or capital loss depending on his purchase price if shares were bought at a dollar amount higher than the redemption amount an investor would be able to claim a capital loss for tax purposes if the redemption amount is greater than the purchase price the investor would have to pay capital gains taxes on the difference investors holding the funds in a taxadvantaged account would not incur these tax issues individual bonds in contrast have different tax characteristics when a bond is purchased at a premium price the excess amount paid over par value can be amortized over the lifespan of the bond if the bond yields taxexempt interest the premium must be amortized see irs publication  for more information on the tax treatment of individual bonds wwwirsgov another key difference is that an investor controls when bonds are added to or removed from his portfolio this puts him in charge of determining the type and timing of capital gains taxes he can also exert greater control over how any interest income is reinvested this is an important distinction because even though the fidelity and the ishares municipal bond funds are designed to be taxfriendly they may not be as taxfriendly as a bond ladder created by an individual investor this loss of tax control is a tradeoff investors make for the advantages offered by definedmaturity funds characteristics of the funds table  shows a listing of the definedmaturity funds available as of september   as the funds with the nearest maturity dates terminate it is expected that new longerdated funds will be introduced check each fund families’ website for the most current list fidelity fidelity is unique in that its fixedmaturity offerings are mutual funds the funds can be purchased directly from fidelity or through other investment firms including some discount brokerage firms morningstar lists scottrade td ameritrade and vanguard among the brokers offering fidelity definedmaturity funds

date for all of the funds is june  of the year listed in the fund’s name in the final year of each fund the proceeds from maturing bonds may be invested in municipal money market securities all five funds primarily invest in investmentgrade municipal bonds income from these bonds is expected to be exempt from federal taxes though tax rules vary by state the funds’ manager mark sommer told me that he selects bonds with maturity dates matching each fund’s termination date in other words the fidelity municipal income  fund fmlcx holds bonds maturing at or mostly prior to june   he tries to avoid callable bonds though he does consider them for the longerdated funds when there aren’t enough noncallable bonds to select from sommer’s intent is to hold bonds until maturity he may however sell bonds if the credit quality deteriorates or if cash is needed to fund redemptions these transactions can result in capital gains or capital loss distributions for shareholders guggenheim guggenheim offers corporate bond and highyield corporate bond etfs branded as “bulletshares” since these are exchangetraded funds they can be bought and sold just like stocks through any broker throughout the trading day this structure means that unlike with fidelity funds there is no minimum investment beyond the prevailing share price furthermore the shares may trade at a premium or discount to net asset value on september   the guggenheim bulletshares  corporate bond etf bscm traded at a  premium to its underlying net asset value the funds are never closed to new investors prior to termination the

objective allows the fund’s manager to transition the holdings to cash us treasury bills and investmentgrade commercial paper distributions are paid monthly interest from all of the bulletshares etfs is taxable at ordinary income rates though bonds are selected with maturity dates matching the fund’s maturity dates transactions may occur either due to changes made by the funds’ manager or due to a

distributions from the ishares muni funds are intended to be taxfree it is possible that some part of the distributions will be taxable in addition any capital gains distributed by the fund to shareholders would be taxable finally an investor would realize a taxable event a capital gain or loss if the fund were sold prior to termination or if the payout at termination is more or less than what he paid for the shares for example an investor who had purchased the ishares  sp amtfree muni term bond etf muaa on january   at  per share would have received a final distribution of  from the fund’s termination on august   the  difference would have been considered to be a longterm capital gain for tax purposes what happens at maturity a realworld example ishares was the first company to offer definedmaturity etfs one of its earliest funds the ishares  sp amtfree municipal series etf muab terminated in august  the  fund ceased trading on august   when the last of its bonds matured the bonds matured on june  june  july  july  august  and august   shareholders could have bought or sold shares of the fund up until the termination date those who held onto the fund were scheduled to receive proceeds in cash based on the net asset value nav as of august   on or after august   ishares instructed shareholders holding the fund in a taxable account to expect to receive irs form  in january  the form may list two classifications of distributions liquidation distribution a return of capital that is not taxable to the investor but each investor needs this number to determine their cost basis to verify if they had a capital gain or loss exemptinterest dividend not subject to income tax as long as muab has more than  assets invested in municipal securities this is the type of distribution the fund has paid since it launched source “upcoming maturity and planned liquidation of ishares  sp amtfree municipal series muab frequently asked questions” ishares making the choice definedmaturity bond funds are an alternative for individual bonds but not an exact substitute these funds provide access to professional management diversified bond portfolios and purchasing power they can also be purchased with different maturity dates and can be laddered definedmaturity funds however lack the customization and control of investing in individual bonds may have tax implications that bonds would not incur and currently do not provide exposure to bonds with maturity dates beyond  years into the future while definedmaturity funds can serve a useful purpose in an individual investor’s portfolio both their advantages and disadvantages should be considered before purchase → charles rotblut cfa is a vice president at aaii and editor of the aaii journal follow him on twitter at twittercomcharlesraaii discussion patrick gariety from mo posted over  years ago thanks much for this article i dont wish to purchase individual bonds but ive been seriously considering defined maturity etfsfunds as an alternative way of capturing some of the benefits of a bond ladder your article was very helpful in clarifying the available options and their differences tim soles from tx posted over  years ago good article i have the guggenheim etfs in my ira portfolio at fidelity and for me it is a way of extending risk into high yield bonds while minimizing the risk of default and thereby obtaining higher yields at the lower risk due to maximum diversification in this bond class lew marks from or posted over  years ago i think these investment vehicles give you most of the best of both worlds  defined maturities  good bond picks at good prices ever try to pick your own bonds and get a decent price the big boys give you the leftovers at higher prices and commissions time will tell but so far i like these products lew victor bradford from co posted over  years ago thank you for the excellent article and the suggested investment resources i have also investigated definedmaturity investments and individual bonds and perhaps the greatest benefit of the former is the diversification these investments allow i have the benefit of humility since i nearly invested in general motors bonds back when they were rated in the b category nevertheless the article may have overstated some differences between bonds bond funds and definedmaturity investments brokerage houses often buy large lots of some bonds so smaller investors may also receive some pricing benefits of largelot purchases you can indeed suffer tax consequences and capital losses from all bond vehicles depending on when you sell them or when your estate sells them if the bonds are sufficiently long term a perpetual bond ladder actually resembles a bond fund in many ways finally even when buying individual bonds from a broker you often wind up relying on their advice or that of the rating agencies too unless you are quite experienced or hubristic mike timlin from co posted over  years ago i am late and new to fixedincome investing but i still have time to get ready for retirement so now is the time to learn when i heard about these late in  i decided to run the experiment so i bought equal quantities of each of the bsjd through bsji in the first half of  so far in spite of all of the fedinduced turmoil the experiment has been a great success the bulletshares highyielders have been magnificent the blended payout has been about  the capital gains have been a nice surprise as im a lowcost buyer the volatility has been trivial note that these funds are highcoupon  and shortduration  years or less which i like i plan to roll over the bsjd when it matures into bsjj and i may roll over the bsje to bsjk if i can get a good prices everybody should own some of these products in my opinion judith boulden from ut posted over  years ago shortly after purchasing muae  ishares  amtfree muni series i noted unusual volatility in price in late may and early july  the usual price is about  and this activity went from a low of about  to a high of  and back again within a couple of days was it a flash crash technical issue or more importantly are these efts so thinly traded that a large transaction can impact the price this much any information or comments would be appreciated charles rotblut from il posted over  years ago hi judith the price movement you are discussing is about  which over the course of few days can simply reflect market volatility interest rates spiked over the summer and impacted the prices of both bonds and bond funds the fixedmaturity funds are designed to be held until maturity the daytoday price movement doesnt matter much once you hold the fund because the proceeds from the underlying bonds will be paid to shareholders after the bonds mature charles russell pettijohn from mo posted over  years ago how much dividend and yield judith boulden from ut posted over  years ago hi charles i realize that but would you look at the price chart it looks odd to me to have that spike scott davis from me posted over  years ago thanks charles  enjoyed your talk at the conference in orlando philip croll from north carolina posted over  years ago i own several of the guggenheim funds i am concerned that while they pay regular interest the principle may not be fully returned several of the junk bond version i own are showing losses on paper do you have any information on the record of how they do over the full term both income and principle would these be expected to come back up over time it wont do much good to earn income and then lose principal at the end charles rotblut from il posted over  years ago hi philip the factors that influence whether or not you will receive the amount you paid for the funds or more depends on the interest you receive over time you held the fund the date at which each bond held by the fund matures the share price you bought the fund at the compromise with definedmaturity bond funds is that they are a hybrid product and as such you are not assured the full return of the money you invested at the funds maturity charles charles rotblut from il posted about  year ago since the original
