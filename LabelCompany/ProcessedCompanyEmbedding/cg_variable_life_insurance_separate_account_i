newsletters variable life insurance policy share loading the player what is a variable life insurance policy a variable life insurance policy is a form of permanent life insurance variable life insurance provides permanent protection to the beneficiary upon the death of the policyholder this type of insurance is generally more expensive than term insurance because it allows the insured to allocate a portion of the premium dollars to a separate account comprised of various instruments and investment funds within the insurance companys portfolio such as stocks bonds equity funds money market funds and bond funds next up universal life insurance life insurance adjustable life insurance whole life insurance policy breaking down variable life insurance policy because of investment risks variable policies are considered securities contracts and are regulated under the federal securities laws therefore they must be sold via a prospectus as a securities product fund performance may lead to declining cash value or death benefit over timevariable life insurance policies have certain tax benefits made available to policyholders such as the ability to utilize cash value on a taxbenefited basis as long as premiums are paid and the policy remains in force policyholders can access the cash value through a taxfree loan against the policy should cash value be withdrawn instead of borrowed the policyholder faces tax implications on any realized earnings any loans taken out that are not repaid have the potential to decrease the death benefit paid to beneficiaries at the time the insured passes awayvariable life insurance flexibilityone of the aspects of variable life insurance that makes it stand out among other permanent life insurance policies is the flexibility it provides policyholders in terms of premiums paid and cash value accumulation premiums paid to a variable life insurance policy are not fixed as they are with traditional whole life insurance or term insurance instead they can be shifted up or down over time within certain limits based on the insureds needs for example an insured with a variable life insurance policy may decide to reduce monthly premium payments from  to  because a major expense may have impeded cash flow for a period of time the cash value within the policy can be used to make up the shortage in premium payments during the time lower premium payments are made when cash flow returns to a comfortable level the insured has the option to increase premiums back to the initial  per monthdownsides of variable life insuranceunlike fixed life insurance products variable life insurance may require policyholders to add premiums over time to ensure the death benefit remains guaranteed to a certain age paying more than the minimum cost of insurance for a variable life insurance policy is one method to ensure guarantees remain intact additionally investment risks within the cash value of a variable life insurance policy fall completely on the policyholder not the insurance company as such there are no guarantees as to how well the cash value may perform over time making it difficult to plan for using accumulated earnings in the future like most life insurance policies individuals are required to undergo full medical underwriting to obtain a variable life insurance policy related terms universal

represent a worldwide view of the subject you may improve this article discuss the issue on the talk page or create a new article as appropriate december  learn how and when to remove this template message variable universal life insurance often shortened to vul is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value in a vul the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts similar to mutual funds and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner the variable component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock andor bond markets the universal component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments the premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the internal revenue code for life insurance this flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy although one may exercise an automatic premium loan feature or surrender dividends to pay a whole life premium variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy with most if not all vuls unlike whole life there is no endowment age the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount which for whole life is typically  this is yet another key advantage of vul over whole life with a typical whole life policy the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy and at endowment age the face amount is all that is paid out thus with either death or endowment the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years however some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase paid up additions to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time if investments made in the separate accounts outperform the general account of the insurance company a higher rateofreturn can occur than the fixed ratesofreturn typical for whole life the combination over the years of no endowment age continually increasing death benefit and if a high rateofreturn is earned in the separate accounts of a vul policy this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as premiums contents  regulation of vul providers  uses  contract features  premium flexibility  maximum premiums  investment choices  tax advantages  risks of variable universal life  general uses of variable universal life  criticisms of variable universal life  references  external links regulation of vul providersedit because the separate accounts are securities the representative providing a vul must be working in accordance with the securities regulations of the country or province in which he operates and because they are life insurance policies vuls may only be sold by representatives who are properly licensed to sell life insurance in the areas in which they operate the insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed as an insurer this dual regulation helps protect consumers who can look up the track record of offenses of any provider listed by the regulating sro self regulatory organization or provincial securities commission united states vuls may only be sold in the united states by representatives who have a producers life insurance license in the states in which he or she operates the insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed in the states as an insurer because the separate accounts are securities the representative must be working through a brokerdealer registered with the united states sro the financial industry regulatory authority finra and himself be registered with finra finra has an online database an investor can use to look up offenses and regulatory actions of any broker or brokerdealer the fact of a representatives securities registration will show on his state insurance license as variable as in qualified for life and variable products the exact wording could vary from state to state canada vuls as life insurance policies may only be sold in canada by life insurancelicensed representatives registered with the insurance regulator in their provincial jurisdiction representatives must comply with the life insurance regulations of their respective province typically a provincial insurance act and as vuls are life insurance policies providers must comply with the national life insurance regulations insurance companies act established by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions osfi since vuls are presently not considered to be securities in canada they are subject to lighter regulatory scrutiny than typical securities products in canada there is no real differentiation between universal life and variable universal lifemkj usesedit variable universal life insurance receives special tax advantages in the united states internal revenue code the cash value in life insurance is able to earn investment returns without incurring current income tax as long as it meets the definition of life insurance and the policy remains in force the tax free investment returns could be considered to be used to pay for the costs of insurance inside the policy see the tax benefits section for more in one theory of life insurance needs based analysis life insurance is only needed to the extent that assets left behind by a person will not be enough to meet the income and capital needs of his or her dependents in one form of variable universal life insurance the cost of insurance purchased is based only on the difference between the death benefit and the cash value defined as the net amount at risk from the perspective of the insurer therefore the greater the cash value accumulation the lesser the net amount at risk and the less insurance that is purchased another use of variable universal life insurance is among relatively wealthy persons who give money yearly to their children to put into vul policies under the gift tax exemption very often persons in the united states with a net worth high enough that they will encounter the estate tax give money away to their children to protect that money being taxed often this is done within a vul policy because this allows a tax deferral for which no alternative would exist besides tuition money saved in an educational ira or  plan provides for permanent life insurance and can usually be accessed taxfree by borrowing against the policy contract featuresedit by allowing the contract owner to choose the investments inside the policy the insured takes on the investment risk and receives the greater potential return of the investments in return if the investment returns are very poor this could lead to a policy lapsing ceasing to exist as a valid policy to avoid this many insurers offer guaranteed death benefits up to a certain age as long as a given minimum premium is paid premium flexibilityedit vul policies have a great deal of flexibility in choosing how much premiums to pay for a given death benefit the minimum premium is primarily affected by the contract features offered by the insurer to maintain a death benefit guarantee that specified premium level must be paid every month to keep the policy in force typically no premium needs to be paid as long as there is enough cash value in the policy to pay that months cost of insurance the maximum premium amounts are heavily influenced by the code for life insurance internal revenue code section  sets limits for how much cash value can be allowed and how much premium can be paid both in a given year and over certain periods of time for a given death benefit the most efficient policy in terms of cash value growth would have the maximum premium paid for the minimum death benefit then the costs of insurance would have the minimum negative effect on the growth of the cash value in the extreme would be a life insurance policy that had no life insurance component and was entirely cash value if it received favorable tax treatment as a life insurance policy it would be the perfect tax shelter pure investment returns and no insurance cost in fact when variable universal life policies first became available in  contract owners were able to make very high investments into their policies and received extraordinary tax benefits in order to curb this

maximum amount of cash value per death benefit and to define a maximum premium for a given death benefit if the maximum premium is exceeded the policy no longer qualifies for all of the benefits of a life insurance contract and is instead known as a modified endowment contract or a mec a mec still receives tax free investment returns and a tax free death benefit but withdrawals of cash value in a mec are on a lifo basis where earnings are withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income if the cash value in a contract exceeds the specified percentage of death benefit the policy no longer qualifies as life insurance at all and all investment earnings become immediately taxable in the year the specified percentage is exceeded in order to avoid this contracts define the death benefit to be the

for young insured persons declining to  for those reaching age  the maximum premiums are set by the irs guidelines such that the premiums paid within a sevenyear period after a qualifying event such as purchase or death benefit increase grown at a  rate and using the maximum guaranteed costs of insurance in the policy contract would endow the policy at age  ie the cash value would equal the death benefit more specific rules are adjusted for premiums that are not paid in equal amounts over a sevenyear period the entire maximum premium greater than the  year premium can be paid in one year and no more premiums can be paid unless the death benefit is increased if the  year level guideline premium is exceeded then the policy becomes a mec to add more confusion the sevenyear mec premium level cannot be paid in a vul every year for  years and still avoid mec status the mec premium level can only be paid in practice for about  years before additional premiums cannot be paid if non mec status

from policy to policy the current generation of vul policies have a wide variety of subaccounts for the policy owner to allocate their cash surrender values into these newer policies often offer  or more separate accounts covering the entire spectrum of asset classes and management styles separate accounts are organized as trusts to be managed for the benefit of the insureds and are so named

refunds of premiums paid in and policy loans which would be paid off on death by the death benefit risks of variable universal lifeedit cost of insurance  the cost of insurance for vuls is generally based on term rates and as the insured ages the risk of mortality increases increasing the cost of insurance if not monitored properly the cost of insurance may eventually exceed the cash outlay depleting savings if this continues long term the savings will be depleted and insured will be given an option to increase the cash outlay to cover the higher cost of insurance or cancel the policy leaving them with no savings and either no insurance or very expensive insurance cash outlay  the cash needed to effectively use a vul is generally much higher than other types of insurance policies if a policy does not have the right amount of funding it may lapse investment risk  because the sub accounts in the vul may be invested in stocks and bonds the insured now takes on the investment risk rather than the insurance company complexity  the vul is a complex product and can easily be used or sold inappropriately because of this proper funding investing and planning are usually required in order for the vul to work as expected general uses of variable universal lifeedit these are the features typically marketed by insurance companies however the vul in most cases will limit the insured to being able to take advantage of only one of these features listed each of these features can be achieved through other means financial protection  as with all life insurance programs vuls can be used to protect a family in the case of a premature death tax advantages  because of its taxdeferred feature the vul may offer an attractive tax advantage especially to those in higher tax brackets to attain them the policy must be highly funded though still nonmec for the tax advantages to offset the cost of insurance these tax advantages can be used for either education planning  the cash value of a vul can be used to help fund childrens education as long as the policy is started very early also putting money into a vul can be used to help children qualify for federal financial aid since the federal government does not consider the cash value when calculating efc expected family contribution retirement planning  because of its taxfree policy loan feature the vul can also be used as taxadvantaged income source in retirement assuming retirement is not in the near future and the policy is not a modified endowment contract again the policy must be properly funded for this strategy to work estate planning  those with a large estate a filing is required for estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding  effective for decedents dying on or after january

variety of separate accounts similar to mutual funds and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner the variable component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock andor bond markets the universal component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments the premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the internal revenue code for life insurance this flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy although one may exercise an automatic premium loan feature or surrender dividends to pay a whole life premium variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy with most if not all vuls unlike whole life there is no endowment age the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount which for whole life is typically  this is yet another key advantage of vul over whole life with a typical whole life policy the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy and at endowment age the face amount is all that is paid out thus with either death or endowment the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years however some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase paid up additions to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time if investments made in the separate accounts outperform the general account of the insurance company a higher rateofreturn can occur than the fixed ratesofreturn typical for whole life the combination over the years of no endowment age continually increasing death benefit and if a high rateofreturn is earned in the separate accounts of a vul policy this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole

universal lifemkj usesedit variable universal life insurance receives special tax advantages in the united states internal revenue code the cash value in life insurance is able to earn investment returns without incurring current income tax as long as it meets the definition of life insurance and the policy remains in force the tax free investment returns could be considered to be used to pay for the costs of insurance inside the policy see the tax benefits section for more in one theory of life insurance needs based analysis life insurance is only needed to the extent that assets left behind by a person will not be enough to meet the income and capital needs of his or her dependents in one form of variable universal life insurance the cost of insurance purchased is based only on the difference between the death benefit and the cash value defined as the net amount at risk from the perspective of the insurer therefore the greater the cash value accumulation the lesser the net amount at risk and the less insurance that is purchased another use of variable universal life insurance is among relatively wealthy persons who give money yearly to their children to put into vul policies under the gift tax exemption very often persons in the united states with a net worth high enough that they will encounter the estate tax give money away to their children to protect that money being taxed often this is done within a vul policy because this allows a tax deferral for which no alternative would exist besides tuition money saved in an educational ira or  plan provides for permanent life insurance and can usually be accessed taxfree by borrowing against the policy contract featuresedit by allowing the contract owner to choose the investments inside the policy the insured takes on the investment risk and receives the greater potential return of the investments in return if the investment returns are very poor this could lead to a policy lapsing ceasing to exist as a valid policy to avoid this many insurers offer guaranteed death benefits up to a certain age as long as a given minimum premium is paid premium flexibilityedit vul policies have a great deal of flexibility in choosing how much premiums to pay for a given death benefit the minimum premium is primarily affected by the contract features offered by the insurer to maintain a death benefit guarantee that specified premium level must be paid every month to keep the policy in force typically no premium needs to be paid as long as there is enough cash value in the policy to pay that months cost of insurance the maximum premium amounts are heavily influenced by the code for life insurance internal revenue code section  sets limits for how much cash value can be allowed and how much premium can be paid both in a given year and over certain periods of time for a given death benefit the most efficient policy in terms of cash value growth would have the maximum premium paid for the minimum death benefit then the costs of insurance would have the minimum negative effect on the growth of the cash value in the extreme would be a life insurance policy that had no life insurance component and was entirely cash value if it received favorable tax treatment as a life insurance policy it would be the perfect tax shelter pure investment returns and no insurance cost in fact when

and when to remove this template message variable universal life insurance often shortened to vul is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value in a vul the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts similar to mutual funds and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner the variable component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock andor bond markets the universal component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments the premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the internal revenue code for life insurance this flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy although one may exercise an automatic premium loan feature or surrender dividends to pay a whole life premium variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy with most if not all vuls unlike whole life there is no endowment age the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount which for whole life is typically  this is yet another key advantage of vul over whole life with a typical whole life policy the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy and at endowment age the face amount is all that is paid out thus with either death or endowment the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years however some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase paid up additions to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time if investments made in the separate accounts outperform the general account of the insurance company a higher rateofreturn can occur than the fixed ratesofreturn typical for whole life the combination over the years of no endowment age continually increasing death benefit and if a high rateofreturn is earned in the separate accounts of a vul policy this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole

considered to be securities in canada they are subject to lighter regulatory scrutiny than typical securities products in canada there is no real differentiation between universal life and variable universal lifemkj usesedit variable universal life insurance receives special tax advantages in the united states internal revenue code the cash value in life insurance is able to earn investment returns without incurring current income tax as long as it meets the definition of life insurance and the policy remains in force the tax free investment returns could be considered to be used to pay for the costs of insurance inside the policy see the tax benefits section for more in one theory of life insurance needs based analysis life insurance is only needed to the extent that assets left behind by a person will not be enough to meet the income and capital needs of his or her dependents in one form of variable universal life insurance the cost of insurance purchased is based only on the difference between the death benefit and the cash value defined as the net amount at risk from the perspective of the insurer therefore the greater the cash value accumulation the lesser the net amount at risk and the less insurance that is purchased another use of variable universal life insurance is among relatively wealthy persons who give money yearly to their children to put into vul policies under the gift tax exemption very often persons in the united states with a net worth high enough that they will encounter the estate tax give money away to their children to protect that money being taxed often this is done within a vul policy because this allows a tax deferral for which no alternative would exist besides tuition money saved in an educational ira or  plan provides for permanent life insurance and can usually be accessed taxfree by borrowing against the policy contract featuresedit by allowing the contract owner to choose the investments inside the policy the insured takes on the investment risk and receives the greater potential return of the investments in return if the investment returns are very poor this could lead to a policy lapsing ceasing to exist as a valid policy to avoid this many insurers offer guaranteed death benefits up to a certain age as long as a given minimum premium is paid premium flexibilityedit vul policies have a great deal of flexibility in choosing how much premiums to pay for a given death benefit the minimum premium is primarily affected by the contract features offered by the insurer to maintain a death benefit guarantee that specified premium level must be paid every month to keep the policy in force typically no premium needs to be paid as long as there is enough cash value in the policy to pay that months cost of insurance the maximum premium amounts are heavily influenced by the code for life insurance internal revenue code section  sets limits for how much cash value can be allowed and how much premium can be paid both in a given year and over certain periods of time for a given death benefit the most efficient policy in terms of cash value growth would have the maximum premium paid for the minimum death benefit then the costs of insurance would have the minimum negative effect on the growth of the cash value in the extreme would be a life insurance policy that had no life insurance component and was entirely cash value if it received favorable tax treatment as a life insurance policy it would be the perfect tax shelter pure investment returns and no insurance cost in fact when variable universal life policies first became available in  contract owners were able to make very high investments into their policies and received extraordinary tax benefits in order to curb this practice but still encourage life insurance purchase the irs developed guidelines regarding allowed premiums for a given death benefit maximum premiumsedit the standard set was twofold to define a maximum amount of cash value per death benefit and to define a maximum premium for a given death benefit if the maximum premium is exceeded the policy no longer qualifies for all of the benefits of a life insurance contract and is instead known as a modified endowment contract or a mec a mec still receives tax free investment returns and a tax free death benefit but withdrawals of cash value in a mec are on a lifo basis where earnings are withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income if the cash value in a contract exceeds the specified percentage of death benefit the policy no longer qualifies as life insurance at all and all investment earnings become immediately taxable in the year the specified percentage is exceeded in order to avoid this contracts define the death benefit to be the higher of the original death benefit or the amount needed to meet irs guidelines the maximum cash value is determined to be a certain percentage of the death benefit the percentage ranges from  or so for young insured persons declining to  for those reaching age  the maximum premiums are set by the irs guidelines such that the premiums paid within a sevenyear period after a qualifying event such as purchase or death benefit increase grown at a  rate and using the maximum guaranteed costs of insurance in the policy contract would endow the policy at age  ie the cash value would equal the death benefit more specific rules are adjusted for premiums that are not paid in equal amounts over a sevenyear period the entire maximum premium greater than the  year premium can be paid in one year and no more premiums can be paid unless the death benefit is increased if the  year level guideline premium is exceeded then the policy becomes a mec to add more confusion the sevenyear mec premium level cannot be paid in a vul every year for  years and still avoid mec status the mec premium level can only be paid in practice for about  years before additional premiums cannot be paid if non mec status is desired there is another premium designed to be the maximum premium that can be paid every year a policy is in force this premium carries different names from different insurers one calling it the guideline maximum premium this is the premium that often reaches the most efficient use of the policy investment choicesedit the number and type of choices available varies from company to company and from policy to policy the current generation of vul policies have a wide variety of subaccounts for the policy owner to allocate their cash surrender values into these newer policies often offer  or more separate accounts covering the entire spectrum of asset classes and management styles separate accounts are organized as trusts to be managed for the benefit of the insureds and are so named

their annual or monthly premium payments this type of policy is beneficial for parents of young children people with debt obligations and also home buyers it can be renewed after the initial term has ended and it may also be converted to a whole life policy the premiums are based on your age and your health status purchasing a new term policy at the expiration of your existing policy will result in a higher premium and you may not qualify if you have disqualifying health issues term life is a death benefit only policy that you buy for a specified length of time think of it like leasing a car you pay for the use of the car for a specified period and when the contract period is over you return the car term life is referred to as benefit only insurance because unlike the various types of permanent life such as whole life it carries no cash surrender value because of this term life insurance premiums tend to be very affordable young and relatively healthy individuals can often obtain a policy with limited or no medical background check it is ideal for families that are just starting out or for the family income provider who wants to make sure his or her family will be protected but may not be able to afford or desire a permanent life policy however understand that as a person ages over the period of the term monthly premiums may increase it is often an ideal option to insure a second spouse or for single people even for children just to make sure the often unexpectedly expensive costs of a funeral are covered there are many insurance and financial professionals who suggest that those who purchase a term life policy can make up for the investment component of a permanent life insurance policy by investing the cost savings between the two on their own the earlier you purchase a term life policy and the healthier you are the cheaper the premiums will be over the term of the policy annual renewable term life policies are those that are purchased yearbyyear the next year you do not have to prequalify simply choose to renew at what may or may not be an increased rate rates for annual renewable policies are at historic lows a young healthy person can get  for only a few hundred dollars per year there are very good rates these days on term life the premium is fixed and will not go up for the life of the term usually   or  years it is not uncommon for a healthy nonsmoking  yearold male to obtain a  or year policy with a fixed premium of less than  per month so just how much insurance should you buy many things factor into that answer but at the minimum the experts say purchase enough insurance to equal at least  years of your present salary if you have young children make that around  years so if you make  a year that means at least  to  in coverage
