lionsgates future intertwined with china ceo jon feltheimer says  hollywood reporter the hollywood reporter lionsgates future intertwined with china says ceo jon feltheimer  am pdt  by clifford coonan facebook twitter email me print comments invision for the hollywood reporterap images the countrys hunan tv and the studio have created a template for working together and were not going to try to jam product into china that doesnt make sense he says lionsgate ceo jon feltheimer said wednesday that a  million filmfinancing deal with hunan tv came about because the chinese company was involved in all the right sectors and he said his studios future was closely linked to china after a lot of conversations with a lot of people we felt this was the simplest one that touches all those boxes feltheimer told thr in an interview in changsha in chinas hunan province after the deal was formally announced theyre in film production distribution advertising locationbased entertainment business they are in tv in a major way they are in the cable business they stepped up and we stepped up and at a certain point we said we were going exclusive under the terms of the deal hunan’s wholly owned subsidiary tik films will cofinance all qualifying lionsgate feature films for the next three years including films such as gods of egypt now you see me  the last witch hunter starring vin diesel sicario and the age of adaline starring blake lively and harrison ford  the minute this deal was signed they were already investing in a whole bunch of movies and they will distribute those movies and cofinance the movies they mentioned weve created a template for working together said feltheimer under the terms of the deal hunan tv will fund a quarter of lionsgate’s production costs or  million with the investment capped at  million a year lionsgates future success is intertwined with china feltheimer emphasized china is for sure the number two film market — last month it was number one the lionsgate ceo said in terms of core business growth weve got to be here and figure it out we have to be part of the scene in china for us to be successful over the next five years and im hoping this deal will be a large part of this chinas regulatory environment is notoriously tricky but feltheimer said he did not find it any more difficult than other markets every market has its own vicissitudes and you have to be respectful of each of the cultures and so far it hasnt been a big issue for us he told thr this deal was approved in whatever way it had to be approved everybody wants all of our businesses to have no restrictions in any country but even in canada in order to distribute home entertainment you need to follow the canadian rules and its just about as hard to do business there as it is in china we are respectful of everyones culture being different the rules being different and we try to follow those rules we have enough content and if every single thing doesnt play here then that will be ok there has been a lot of discussion about coproductions in china official coproductions have a bigger slice of the box office and have better access to the market but there are few examples of major successes so far feltheimer said that problems have come when people strike a deal without having produced a movie or tv show you need to ask is that a viable product is it repeatable is it special does it survive the test of time meaning does it add value to your company is it true library product if its not then you probably shouldnt be making it no matter what your cofinancing deal is he explained said feltheimer were not going to scramble to make chinese movies that we dont believe in were not going to make coproductions that we dont believe in and were not going to try to jam product into china that doesnt make sense he said that one area that would be of particular interest would be developing content based on video games with the first project to be based on candy crush saga as well as localizing successful tv shows for the china market including shows based on matt kunitz titles such as fear factor were going to build big production values build one big set maybe do three or four different languages on that one set the core is to find one thing that works for one audience said feltheimer feltheimer also spoke of his excitement about the virtual reality business that lionsgates summit entertainment label is building with samsung among the vr efforts is insurgent the second installment in the divergent franchise fans don an oculuspowered gear vr headset and enter a  degree immersive world where they are captured by jeanine matthews kate winslet and her erudite faction when you put that headset on and think of all the applications for home entertainment sports gaming — technology keeps creating new and better ways to enjoy entertainment and for us the key thing is to be really controlling as much intellectual property as we can not just in the us said feltheimer last year lionsgate and the chinese ecommerce colossus alibaba signed a strategic collaboration deal to offer lionsgate titles in china including divergent and the twilight saga eclipse and tv shows such as mad men weeds and the royals the movies and tv shows are available through the lionsgate entertainment world lgew service a subscription streaming service for mainland china that will be available exclusively through alibabas settop box nearly two thirds of chinese people access content via their cell phones or tablets and looking ahead lionsgate is also keen to expand its presence in mobile you cant ignore mobile we are doing a lot of stuff in the game space mostly nonconsole stuff and those are primarily mobilepad games thats going to be a big business and its a lot simpler than going for a console game we dont care what device you watch on as long as you watch it said feltheimer to be able to watch something that you start on your television that you then move to your mobile device i think thats a big benefit for the content business facebook twitter email me print comments clifford coonan email protected thr

first appeared in the jan  issue of the hollywood reporter magazine when jon feltheimer — this years recipient of the milestone award the guilds highest honor — became ceo of lionsgate entertainment in  the word niche was an insult but thanks in part to the way this brooklynborn producer has steered his studio for the past  years nobodys turning up their nose at niche anymore read more lionsgate ceo jon feltheimer leaps past les moonves among highestpaid media ceos he started by identifying core audiences that were being underserved in the marketplace say teens who want to see limbs removed with woodworking tools then overserved them with seven saw movies meanwhile he bet on prestigebuilding art house projects such as hotel rwanda and crash which beat brokeback mountain to win best picture at the  oscars he navigated his company through tricky mergers with artisan in  engineered ambitious acquisitions getting into the twilight business by buying summit expanded lionsgates tv production to include buzzedabout shows mad men and orange is the new black and turned ya novels hunger games and divergent into two of the biggestgrossing niche franchises of modern times now the company — which raked in  billion at the worldwide box office in  and nearly half a billion dollars in tv revenue a year earlier — boasts a stock valuation of  billion  thr asked feltheimer  about how he chooses his studios slate what happens to lionsgate after hunger games and if he could reveal every detail of the final episode of mad men lionsgate built itself by appealing to niche audiences but hunger games isnt exactly a niche movie if you look at it based on boxoffice growth or on a worldwide scale its definitely not a niche movie but its funny when we thought about hunger games initially we thought about it as a movie that we could start with a core quadrant and expand we thought about it as within one or two quadrants and how to market it to them read more sony hack lionsgate wanted to discuss merger acquisition the hunger games franchise wraps in november whats the future for lionsgate in the ya space were always looking for ways to extend all of our intellectual property weve seen thats what happened with harry potter and the lord of the rings so were always looking for worlds within the ip that we havent explored yet so youre saying something else in the hunger games world isnt out of the question not saying specifically for the hunger games but we have other franchises too if you look at divergent for example after the third book author veronica roth actually put out a novella called four there may be other material there one never knows when we dig into the treasure troves of these brilliant writers what we might find read more veronica roth excited to move on after final divergent story four qa can there be another ya franchise as successful as twilight or hunger games or has that moment passed these franchises are like magic you cant prescribe them they come out of the ether a little bit and then you hope you manage them well enough to make them everything they can be have you seen the final episode of mad men oh yes i try to watch everything we do im not happy that its ending but i think matthew weiner did a wonderful job from beginning to end i think its going to always remain as one of the best series ever done i will say i do feel people have ignored how good the acting is with jon hamm never winning an emmy and the fact that mad men didnt get any golden globe nominations this year i feel like its been so good for so long that people began expecting even more i think the quality has never gone down on that show and the acting and writing are amazing we all need to tip our hats to this incredible group is there anything you know now that you wish youd known back in  when you became ceo everything laughs i feel like i learn something new every day and thats whats exciting about my job facebook twitter email me print comments

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
