thriving wine industry and helping to establish its global reputation for quality died of heart failure thursday at his home in dundee ore his son jason saidagainst the advice of his professors in the viticulture and enology program at uc davis lett arrived in the willamette valley in  armed with a bachelors degree and  vine cuttingsthe pacific northwest had been dismissed as being too cold and wet for cultivating wine grapes but within  years the wines lett produced at eyrie vineyards beat the best french chateaux in international competitiontoday the region just southwest of portland is renowned for its exceptional pinot noirshe was certainly a visionary who saw oregon as an opportunity for pinot noir and some of the coolclimate grapes dick ponzi a veteran winemaker who established his vineyards in the willamette valley only a few years after lett said in an interview saturdayhe was dedicated to making the best wines and was very meticulous that wayborn in chicago in  lett grew up in utah and earned a bachelors degree in philosophy at the university of utah in bound for dental school he got sidetracked on a visit to napa valley and captivated by the fledgling winemaking scene enrolled at uc davis and traveled to france to learn all he could about wineafter graduating from davis lett found his way to oregonin his search for a location that closely matched that of the traditional burgundy region of france he discovered a climate just cool enough to allow for a long growing season and a harvest timed to the fruits peak ripenessin california most winemakers were finding success with warmweather grapes such as cabernet sauvignon and merlotbut lett was aiming for something more delicate and restrained than those big bold red varietals when he planted pinot noir and pinot gris on  hilly acres in dundee in that same year he got married and made ends meet by selling textbookshe and his wife diana converted an old turkey processing plant in mcminnville into their winery at a time when most valley farmers tended fruit or nut orchards the company was named for the hawk nests crowning some nearby pine treesin  lett entered a  eyrie south block reserve pinot noir in an international wine tasting competition in paris it wound up third in the judging shocking the expertsthe french not willing to concede that an american wine could stand up to their best efforts staged another competition the next year letts pinot noir entry moved up a notch to second place and pushed the willamette valley into the wine world spotlightlett was a handson vintner spending as much time among the vines as he did with the barrelsi follow the simple philosophy that the less man fiddles around with what is essentially a product of nature then the better the product will be he said in a  interview with the timescritics praised the end result often citing the wines acidity and minerality their elegance and subtletieswine critic richard nalley writing in food  wine magazine in  called the  eyrie estate pinot noir a perfectly balanced beauty an ideal food partner that will improve with ageover the years lett expanded the vineyards to a modest  acres but kept the yield relatively small by producing  to  cases annuallyhe retired in  turning over management of the winery to his son jason but stayed active with local conservation and landuse organizationsin
