quantum dots have a myriad of potential applications too numerous to mention them all that makes quantum dots a true enabling technology for all fields of science it is hard to imagine a current product that would not be made better by quantum dots by better features more accuracy energy savings less weight higher reliability and lifetime andor lower cost as a quantum dot manufacturer our focus is producing the best performing and highest production rate using economies of scale as such quantum materials is “application agnostic” by automating and then scaling quantum dot production we keep our focus on making better and better quantum dots we seek to partner with experienced product manufacturers to design and market new and exciting quantum dot products quantum materials nc process system can produce a range of composite or hybrid tetrapod quantum dots with reliable uniformity and assurance of industrial scale quantities necessary in a joint developmentjoint venture to create a profitable fundable business plan we can also provide our tetrapod quantum dots in joint development at different levels of discovery or by licensing with universities the examples of future products in the tabs are perhaps the best known some like solar energy and solid state lighting have the potential to change the world as we know it by providing low cost energy for production and low
