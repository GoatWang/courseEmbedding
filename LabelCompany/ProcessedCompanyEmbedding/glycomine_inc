announces  million series a financing to advance a new generation of replacement therapies for rare diseases news provided by glycomine inc nov    et share this article san francisco nov   prnewswire  glycomine inc a biotechnology company developing a new generation of replacement therapies for rare diseases today announced that it has raised  million in a series a financing led by sanderling ventures and supported by chiesi ventures as well as existing high net worth individuals and patients glycomine will use the proceeds from this financing to complete ind enabling preclinical studies and initiate clinical studies of its substrate replacement therapy in patients with congenital disorder of glycosylation type ia cdgia and to accelerate discovery efforts towards an enzyme replacement therapy for nglycanase deficiency ngly glycomines approach to a new generation of replacement therapies focuses on intracellular delivery and targeting of treatments to clinically relevant organs said agnes rafalko phd glycomines chief executive officer we are very grateful for the funding and support we have received from our investors patients families and doctors as we embark on the development of the firstever replacement therapy for cdgia the therapy has the potential to significantly improve both patients quality of life and lifespan cdgia is a debilitating disorder with no treatment and glycomines approach to therapy is our only hope for these patients said prof jaak jaeken of university of leuven belgium the mastermind behind the discovery of congenital disorders of glycosylation replacement therapies continue to play an important role in orphan diseases one of the advantages of substrate or enzyme replacement therapies is having the ability to adjust the therapeutic dose according to patients needs and disease severity said gregory enns md of stanford medicine who is also a member of the companys clinical advisory board glycomines approach reminds me of the emergence of therapies for lysosomal storage disorders said christopher starr phd glycomines executive chairman and previously cofounder and clevel executive of biomarin and raptor mucopolysaccharidosis i mps i was the first of its class to be successfully treated with enzyme replacement therapy and led the way to biomarins pipeline growth in other mps and lysosomal storage disorders cdgia is one of the first out of more than  unaddressed disorders of glycosylation to be potentially treated with a substrate replacement therapy in conjunction with glycomines series a financing the company announced that peter mcwilliams phd mba managing director at sanderling ventures and giacomo chiesi mba managing partner at chiesi ventures joined the companys board of directors sanderling is delighted to invest is such a deeply passionate experienced and highly talented management team said peter mcwilliams together with the expertise of chiesi ventures we aim at accelerating the development of longawaited and truly important therapies for patients in immense need about congenital disorder of glycosylation type ia congenital disorder of glycosylation type ia cdgia is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of an enzyme called phosphomannomutase  encoded by the gene pmm as a result the body fails to produce glycoproteins which are proteins decorated with carbohydrates often referred to as sugar trees cdgia affects many systems of the body including the nervous system approximately  of children with the disease die within the first few years of life often due to infection liver problems or heart disease others with cdgia may live into adulthood and most are wheelchair bound throughout their life unable to speak and live independently there is no cure or therapeutic option for  children diagnosed with the disorder for more information about the disease and patient network please visit cdg community alliance and resource exchange at wwwcdgcarecom about glycomine inc glycomine is developing orphan drugs for serious rare monogenic disorders of metabolism and protein misfolding for which no other therapeutic options exist the companys approach is to combine replacement therapies – substrates enzymes or proteins – with intracellular delivery vehicles consisting of bionanomaterials or ligands that target the molecules to the cell interior of clinically relevant organs the company is based in san francisco california for more information please visit us at wwwglycominecom about sanderling ventures founded in  sanderling is among the oldest

congenital disorder of glycosylation is one of several rare inborn errors of metabolism in which glycosylation sugar coating of a variety of tissue proteins andor lipids is deficient or defective congenital disorders of glycosylation are sometimes known as cdg syndromes they often cause serious sometimes fatal malfunction of several different organ systems in affected infants congenital disorder of glycosylation type ia cdgia is a genetic metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of cytosolic enzyme phosphomannomutase  encoded by the gene pmm which is required for the conversion of mannosephosphate to mannose phosphate required for the synthesis of gdpmannose the donor of mannose to a growing lipidlinked oligosaccharide llo precursor as a result the incorporation of mannose into llo is reduced and glycoproteins lacking complete nlinked glycans are synthesized the body’s failure to produce complete nlinked glycans causes highly variable clinical manifestations that may include feeding problems vomiting and diarrhea with failure to thrive in infants and severe encephalopathy with axial hypotonia abnormal eye movement marked psychomotor retardation peripheral neuropathy cerebellar hypoplasia strokelike episodes and retinitis pigmentosa in late infancy childhood or adulthood the severe cellular and organ dysfunction of cdgia typically leads to death in early childhood there are currently no fda approved treatments specific to cdgia for more than  patients worldwide supportive care is aimed at treating symptoms and sequelae glycomine is working on the development of mannosephosphate replacement therapy intended to bypass the genetic block in the mannose phosphate pathway and provide continuous exposure over long periods of time it is expected that such treatment will supply mannosephosphate into affected cells which will incorporate it into nglycans of glycoproteins and potentially restore fundamental bodily functions and improve quality of life for both patients and their families ngly deficiency ngly is a genetic disorder of the endoplasmic reticulumassociated degradation pathway caused by a deficiency of a cytosolic enzyme nglycanase  encoded by the gene ngly which is required for cleaving nlinked glycans from misfolded glycoproteins prior to degradation lacking nglycanase leaves the body with an impaired capacity to degrade misfolded glycoproteins which accumulate in the cells of patients nglydeficient patients have a striking clinical triad consisting of abnormal tear production choreoathetosis liver disease global developmental delay acquired microcephaly hypotonia eeg abnormalities with or without overt seizures brain imaging abnormalities peripheral neuropathy and constipation to date  patients were diagnosed with ngly deficiency efforts are ongoing to identify many more who may have been misdiagnosed with diseases of similar physical characteristics there are currently no fda approved treatments specific to ngly deficiency supportive care is aimed at treating symptoms and sequelae together with the grace wilsey foundation glycomine is working on the development of recombinant human ngly enzyme replacement
