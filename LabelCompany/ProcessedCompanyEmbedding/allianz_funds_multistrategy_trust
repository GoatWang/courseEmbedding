plus borrowings made for investment purposes in bonds and other fixed income securities including derivative instruments that provide synthetic exposure to fixed income securities   allianzgi global dynamic allocation fund global dynamic fund investment objective  longterm capital appreciation   the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective through active allocation among global equity fixed income and a range of other opportunistic asset classes together with actively managed strategies within those asset classes the fund invests directly and indirectly in globally diverse equity securities including emerging market equities and in us dollardenominated fixed income securities the funds baseline longterm allocation consists of  to global equity exposure and  to fixed income exposure as well as an opportunistic component of up to  of its net assets     summary prospectus   glide path   the fund has established strategic equity component and strategic fixed income component allocations which change over time in relation to the funds target retirement date and according to a predetermined glide path as shown in the following table the target date refers to the approximate year an investor in the fund would plan to retire ie the funds target date the glide path represents the shifting of strategic equity component allocations over time and shows how the funds asset mix becomes more conservative as the target date approaches and passes this reflects individuals expected need for reduced market risks as retirement approaches and for lower portfolio volatility after retiring allianzgi us has determined the glide path based on quantitative and qualitative insights around investor return goals and risk tolerance investment horizon capital market assumptions and behavioral finance aspects at its target date each funds strategic equity component is anticipated to be approximately  of its assets before the target date each funds strategic equity component is anticipated to be higher depending on how many years the target date is from the current year for example if the target date is  years in the future the table below shows the strategic equity component to be  and the strategic fixed income component to be    after the fund reaches its target date its equity component will continue to fall by approximately two percentage points each subsequent year until such time as the fund is merged into the allianzgi retirement income fund or the equity component reaches    years totargetdate      strategic equity

its derivative positions the fund may have gross investment exposures in excess of  of its net assets  after reaching the target date the funds strategic asset allocation will gradually become more conservative and resemble that of the allianzgi retirement income fund into which the fund is expected to merge within eight years provided that the funds board of trustees determines the transaction is in the best interest of shareholders   the table above demonstrates the allocation between the funds equity component and fixed income component which together will always comprise a minimum of  of the funds portfolio in addition the exposure ranges in the table above indicate the extent to which the funds equity component and fixed income component would typically vary from the applicable strategic exposures at a given point in time on the glide path in addition to the allocations above the fund has the ability to invest up to  in its opportunistic component the overall allocation to equity in global dynamic allocation is variable with a strategic long term allocation of    the strategic equity and fixed income component allocation ranges set forth in the table above are shown as of a specific target date and will transition over time for example the actual equity and fixed income component allocation ranges for the fund with  years to its target date would fall between the ranges shown above for  years to target date and  years to target date the graph below illustrates how the strategic equity component allocation ranges in the table above move along the glide path over time     in addition to the changes in strategic allocation as its target date approaches the funds actual exposure may vary substantially over time depending on such factors as market circumstances and allianzgi uss active approach to asset allocation allianzgi us applies an active approach to asset allocation to seek to enhance returns over a full market cycle and to mitigate risk including in times of severe extended market downturns      summary prospectus   the fund may also gain up to  exposure to the opportunistic component opportunistic component asset classes include but are not limited to those related to emerging market debt intermediate and longterm high yield debt commonly referred to as junk bonds commodities nonus bonds and real estate including us and nonus real estate investment trusts reits   securities instruments actively or passively managed strategies whose primary purpose is to gain exposure to one or more of the opportunistic asset classes count toward the opportunistic components  limit thus exposure to opportunistic asset classes resulting from investments in diversified underlying strategies is not included in the calculation of the opportunistic component of the funds portfolio   as reflected in the equity allocation graph above the portfolio managers adjust the funds exposure to equities fixed income and other asset classes in an effort to mitigate downside risk including in times of severe market stress and to increase the return potential in favorable markets although the strategic allocation to the equity component at the target date is  the actual allocation can be as low as  depending on market conditions while the portfolio managers attempt to mitigate the downside risk to stabilize performance there can be no assurance that the fund will be successful in doing so   when deciding how to allocate across equity fixed income and other asset classes the portfolio managers analyze momentum and momentum reversion as part of the investment process for the fund momentum is the tendency of investments to exhibit persistence in their performance momentum reversion is the tendency that a performance trend will ultimately change and move in an opposite direction   in addition to momentum and momentum reversion signals the portfolio managers also apply fundamental analysis to locate opportunities to seek to improve the funds return in implementing these investment strategies the fund will make substantial use of futures and forward contracts both long and short for bonds equities reits and currencies the fund may also incorporate other overthecounter otc or exchangetraded derivatives to gain adjust or hedge exposure to different asset classes or market segments this may include interest rate swaps total return swaps credit default swaps options puts and calls purchased or sold by the fund and structured notes the fund may maintain a significant percentage of its assets in cash and cash equivalents which will serve as margin or collateral for the funds obligations under derivatives transactions   the fund may invest in any type of equity or fixed income security including common and preferred stocks mutual funds etfs warrants and convertible securities mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities and government and corporate bonds the fund may invest in securities of companies of any capitalization including smaller capitalization companies the fund also may make investments intended to provide exposure to one or more commodities or securities indices currencies and real estaterelated securities the fund is expected to be highly diversified across industries sectors and countries the fund may liquidate a holding if it locates another instrument that offers a more attractive exposure to an asset class or when there is a change in the funds target asset allocation or if the holding is otherwise deemed inappropriate   as a result of its derivatives positions the fund may have gross investment exposures in excess of  of its net assets ie the fund may be leveraged and therefore subject to heightened risk of loss the funds performance can depend substantially on the performance of assets or indices underlying its derivatives even though it does not directly or indirectly own those underlying assets or indices     principal risks   the principal risks of investing in the fund which could adversely affect its net asset value yield and total return are in alphabetical order after the first five risks   allocation

risk  convertible securities are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk may be speculative and may decline in value due to increases in interest rates or an issuers deterioration or default   credit and counterparty risk  an issuer or counterparty may default on obligations currency risk  the values of nonus securities may fluctuate with currency exchange rates and exposure to nonus currencies may subject the fund to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the us dollar   derivatives risk  derivative instruments are complex have different characteristics than their underlying assets and are subject to additional risks including leverage liquidity and valuation   emerging markets risk  nonus investment risk may be particularly high to the extent that the fund invests in emerging market securities these securities may present market credit currency liquidity legal political technical and other risks different from or greater than the risks of investing in developed countries   fixed income risk  fixed income debt securities are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk may be speculative and may decline in value due to changes in interest rates or an issuers or counterpartys deterioration or default   focused investment risk  focusing on a limited number of issuers sectors industries or geographic regions

transparent and subject to less oversight particularly in emerging markets reit and real estaterelated investment risk  adverse changes in the real estate markets may affect the value of reit investments or real estatelinked derivatives   short selling risk  short selling enhances leveraging risk and involves counterparty risk and the risk of unlimited loss   smaller company risk  securities issued by smaller companies may be more volatile and present increased liquidity risk relative to securities issued by larger companies   variable distribution risk  periodic distributions by investments of variable or floating interest rates vary with fluctuations in market interest rates   please see summary of principal risks in the funds prospectus for a more
