utility poles increase the risk of accidents see city of edmonds  pd at  furthermore downed lines as the result of ice or wind storms not only present a hazard on the ground but also impact the safety and welfare of people in their homes due to loss of power in the winter months based on these considerations we conclude that requiring electric distribution lines to be placed underground reasonably relates to the citys legitimate interest in public safety and the general welfare of its citizenry having determined that the city had the authority to require undergrounding under minnstat § b and reasonably exercised that authority we must next examine how the ordinance impacts nsps commissionapproved tariffs since we have determined that the legislature has explicitly granted municipal authority to require distribution line undergrounding we do not reach the issue of preemption see mangold midwest co v village of richfield  minn    nwd    defining preemption as the concept of occupation of the field similarly when the legislature specifically grants authority to municipalities the exercise of that authority cannot logically be seen to conflict with state law see northern

the ordinance and the tariffs conflict but both the city and nsp claim authority in the mpua the legislature does not intend a result that is absurd impossible of execution or unreasonable minnstat §   it would be absurd to interpret the mpua as granting conflicting authority therefore the extent to which there is conflict is also the extent to which the statutory authority has been exceeded by one of the parties we have already determined that the legislatures specific grant of authority to municipalities to require utility line undergrounding must prevail over the general grant of authority to the commission to regulate services see minnstat §  subd  therefore to the extent that tariff section a conflicts with the citys ordinance the tariff must yield similarly tariff section a is unenforceable to the extent that it would require compensation for the citys valid exercise of its authority to regulate utility line undergrounding under the statute this comports with the longheld

second nsp has a remedy at the public utilities commission nsp may request that the commission allocate the additional costs of undergrounding to the appropriate group of ratepayers nsp further contends that a municipality may not require underground placement of electric lines without compensation because such a requirement creates a conflict with nsps statutory duty not to discriminate as set forth in minnstat §§ b  nsp argues that by conferring a special benefit on its citizens placement of power lines underground without paying nsp for this improvement the city requires nsp to collect the costs of those improvements from ratepayers across the state thus all ratepayers outside the city of oakdale are paying a discriminatory rate while we need not decide whether the citys ordinance will result in unreasonable rate discrimination under minnstat §§ b and   we do note that nsp has a statutory remedy that allows nsp to address discriminatory rate concerns if any without interfering with the citys dulyenacted ordinance nsp may request the commission allocate additional costs of complying with the ordinance to the ratepayers benefiting from the service see minnstat § b this approach is specifically outlined in tariff section e which provides in relevant part where special facilities are requested or required by a municipality and payment is not made by the municipality the excess expenditures will be the responsibility of nsps customers residing within the municipality and will be recovered from those customers through a rate surcharge or other method approved by the commission nsp argues that it should not be required to obtain surcharge approval each time a municipality requires a special installation nsp cites no authority for this position the duty to avoid rate discrimination is nsps duty see minnstat §§ b the commission has approved tariff section e and nsp is bound by it decision the district court erred when it determined that nsps rate tariffs at issue did not attain the status of general state law due to procedural deficiencies however the district court correctly determined the ordinance in question was authorized by statute the

their proximity to public traffic the ordinance imposes the requirement of underground installation for all electric distribution lines of  volts or less without regard to any safety or public welfare
