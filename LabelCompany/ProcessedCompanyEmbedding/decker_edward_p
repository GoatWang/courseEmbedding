record year for our business as we achieved the highest sales and net earnings in company history fiscal  sales grew  billion to  billion an increase of  from fiscal  while diluted earnings per share grew  to  sales for the fourth quarter were  billion up  from last year comp sales were up  from last year and our us stores had positive comps of  diluted earnings per share were  in the fourth quarter we continue to see broadbased growth across the store and our geographies all three of our us divisions posted positive comps in the fourth quarter as did all  us regions and top  markets internationally both our mexican and canadian businesses posted positive comps in local currency for the quarter making it  and  quarters in a row of positive comps respectively our merchants and store teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service for our customers across multiple events throughout the quarter both in stores and online as ted will detail both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter and all of our merchandising departments posted positive comps we saw healthy balance of growth among both our pro and diy categories with pro sales outpacing diy sales in the quarter a portion of our overall pro strategy is focused on the integration of the underlying business which continues to progress we are pleased with the traction that we are seeing as we have successfully completed work on the first business use case the rollout of interlines catalog of products is now taking place across all us home depot stores the next phase of the integration is focused on enabling interlines customers to use their interline accounts for purchases in home depot stores or on homedepotcom were excited about the opportunity interline provides us to expand our share of wallet with pro customers our interconnected business made great strides in  the team substantially completed the hdcom redesign with enhanced features for better search and faster checkout upgraded the mobile app and introduced a dynamic estimated time of arrival feature to provide customers a faster and more accurate delivery date based on location we measure the success of these changes by the increased traffic and conversion rates that we have seen across our interconnected platforms as well as improved customer service scores for the year our online business grew over  versus the prior year and now represents  of our total sales while we are seeing significant growth in our online business our stores have never been more relevant as about  of our online us orders are picked up in our stores a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy as you know our interconnected business is much more than our online properties as it seeks to blend the physical and digital world seamlessly to enable customers to shop with us whenever and however they choose a key component of this strategy has been the investments that weve made to meet customers demands for increased fulfillment options this quarter we completed the rollout of bodfs or buy online deliver from store bodfs was built on the foundation of our new customer order management system or com which was fully deployed in all us stores during the second quarter of  were pleased with the positive customer response to this enhanced delivery option which streamlines the delivery experience for both our customers and our store associates our customer demands are changing which means we must continue to simplify operations for our store associates our efforts to improve our freighthandling initiatives by connecting endtoend are focused on creating one consistent process for every store that drives efficiency removes waste and optimizes product flow from truck to shelf this quarter we completed the rollout of manual flow load for trucks from our rdcs to stores which is a documented process for better utilization or cubeout of trucks en route to our stores this process is standardized across all stores and has the benefits of reducing transportation costs by fully utilizing the capacity of each storebound truck as well as improving freight movement at the back of our stores as products are staged more efficiently for store associates turning to  overall gdp growth and the strength in the us housing market should continue to support growth in our business as carol will detail we expect  comp sales of approximately  and diluted earnings per share of  it was announced today that our board approved an increase in our targeted dividend payout ratio from  to  and a  increase in our quarterly dividend to  per share which equates to  annually the board also authorized a new share repurchase program of  billion we remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create value for our shareholders we will invest to sustain and grow our business and return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases over the past two years we grew our sales by over  billion this was accomplished during a time when introduced a great deal of change into the business not just in the us but in canada and mexico as well projects like com and bodfs the acquisition of interline and our supply chain initiatives challenged our associates to adapt and learn to do old things in new ways our orangeblooded associates repeatedly rise to meet these new challenges head on demonstrating the entrepreneurial spirit and passion for our customers that has made the home depot what it is today i want to close by thanking these associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers in the fourth quarter and throughout the year for the second half of the year  of our stores qualified for success sharing our profitsharing program for our hourly associates we look forward to continuing this momentum in  and with that let me turn the call over to ted edward p decker  the home depot inc thanks craig and good morning everyone we had a strong fourth quarter as sales exceeded our expectations we saw strength across the store led by our pro customer and our online business continued its doubledigit growth with sales growth of approximately  in the fourth quarter all of our merchandising departments posted positive comps led by flooring and tools which had doubledigit comps in the quarter lumber outdoor garden appliances decor indoor garden lighting and plumbing were above the companys average comp hardware millwork electrical kitchenbath building materials and paint were all positive but below the company average we continue to see balanced growth between transactions and average ticket in the quarter total comp transactions increased  while comp average ticket grew by  our average ticket increase was slightly impacted by commodity price inflation and foreign currency commodity price inflation positively impacted ticket growth by approximately  basis points while a weaker mexican peso negatively impacted ticket growth by approximately  basis points looking at big ticket sales in the fourth quarter transactions over  which represent approximately  of our us sales were up  the drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were flooring appliances and several pro categories once again pro sales grew faster than the company comp we saw strong comps in pro heavy categories like fencing pressuretreated decking commercial and industrial lighting electrical wiring and interior doors we also saw strength with our diy customer classes that outperformed included special order carpet outdoor power laminate flooring and storage we drove record sales in each of our black friday gift center and holiday programs our customers responded to our great values since traffic increased inside our stores and online and we recorded our highest cyber week ever our events helped drive robust comps in decorative holiday tool storage power tools and appliances as part of our focus on balancing the art and science of retail we continue to refine and localize our assortments in our outdoor garden category we are leveraging the power and agility of our local garden merchants these merchants work directly with our stores and local growers to ensure we have the right mix of products to meet the demands of each individual community as an example during the drought in the west our merchants sourced the highestquality drought resistant live goods as we look for to this spring our local merchants are adjusting the assortment to meet current demand given much weather conditions as customer preference continues to evolve and change we will have local customized assortments so that the right product is always available now lets turn our attention to the first quarter we are committed to being the product authority for home improvement product authority means having the best brands at great everyday values for our customers with this we are excited to

be offering special buys on springtime products such as grills outdoor power equipment and live goods were looking forward to a great spring season with that id like to turn the call over to carol carol b tomé  the home depot inc thank you ted and good morning everyone in the fourth quarter sales were  billion a  increase from last year versus last year foreign currency rates primarily a weaker mexican peso negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately  million or  our total company comps or samestore sales were positive  for the quarter with positive comps of  in november  in december and  in january comps for us stores were positive  for the quarter with positive comps of  in november  in december and  in january for fiscal  our sales increased  to  billion and total company comp sales were positive  comps for us stores were positive  during the year a stronger us dollar negatively impacted sales growth by approximately  million or  our total company gross margin was  for the quarter a decrease of  basis points from last year the change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors first we had  basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain driven primarily by increased productivity second we had  basis points of gross margin contraction due to higher shrink than one year ago and finally we had approximately  basis points of gross margin contraction due mainly to a change in the mix of products sold for the year we experienced  basis points of gross margin contraction in the fourth quarter operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by  basis points to  our expense leverage was driven principally by our strong sales performance and good expense control our total company expenses were  million higher than planned due to expenses associated with our  payment data breach with this we now believe the majority of expenses associated with our payment data breach are behind us fiscal  operating expense as a percent of sales was  a decrease of  basis points from what we reported last year for the year our expenses grew at  of our sales growth rates our operating margin for the quarter was  and for the year was  reflecting favorable tax reserve adjustments in the fourth quarter our effective tax rate was  and for the year our effective tax rate was  our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were  an increase of  from last year for the year diluted earnings per share were  an increase of  compared to fiscal  now moving to some additional highlights during the fiscal year we opened four new stores in mexico bringing our total store count to  and selling square footage to  million square feet for the year total sales per square foot increased  to  our highest sales per square foot since  at the end of the quarter merchandise inventories were  billion up  million from last year and inventory turns were  times flat with last year moving on to capital allocation in fiscal  we generated approximately  billion of cash from operations and used that cash as well as proceeds from  billion of incremental longterm debt issuances to invest in the business repurchase our shares and pay dividends to our shareholders during the year we invested approximately  billion back into the business through capital expenditures further we repurchased approximately  billion or about  million of our outstanding shares including roughly  billion or  million shares in the fourth quarter and finally during the year we paid  billion in dividends to our shareholders computed on the average of beginning and ending longterm debt and equity for the trailing  months return on invested capital was   basis points higher than at the end of fiscal  now looking ahead this morning we issued a press release with our guidance for fiscal  and i want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights remember that we guide off of gaap so our fiscal  guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal  as we look to  we remain encouraged by the strength of our core business and by what we are seeing in the housing environment while private fixed residential investment as a percentage of gdp now stands at  it has a way to go before it reaches the historical mean of  home price appreciation housing turnover and household formation continue to be tailwinds for our business using our directionallycorrect but imperfect sales forecasting model we are planning for fiscal  sales to grow by approximately  sales growth at interline and the opening of six new stores in  will not materially change our overall growth rate so our  comp sales guidance is the same as our overall sales growth guidance now one last comment on our sales growth guidance it is based on  average us dollar foreign exchange rates if exchange rates remain where they are today there is about  million of sales pressure to the guidance for fiscal  we are projecting our gross margin rate to decline by approximately  basis points from  as we are planning for outpaced growth in lowermargin categories such as appliances and certain building material categories on the expense front we are forecasting our expenses to grow at approximately  of the rate of our sales growth in line with the longterm guidance we provided to you in  for the year we expect that our operating margin will grow by approximately  basis points to  reaching our fiscal  target one year in advance of our goal we will update our fiscal  operating margin target at our investor conference scheduled for later in the year for the year we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately  starting with fiscal  we are adopting fasb accounting standards update  for employee sharebased compensation note that the estimated positive impact of this new accounting standard is reflected in our projected tax rate but the actual impact wont be fully understood until equity grants are exercised throughout the year we expect our fiscal  diluted earnings per share to grow approximately  to  now as craig mentioned in his remarks in support of our commitment to return value to shareholders our board just announced a new share repurchase authorization of  billion replacing our existing authorization our earnings per share guidance includes our plan to replace approximately  billion of outstanding shares during the year using excess cash for the year we project cash flow from the business of roughly  billion our  capital spending plan is approximately  billion we will use this capital to support our strategic initiatives and invest in our aging store base to improve the customer experience in addition to capital spending and share repurchases we will use our cash to pay  billion in dividends to our shareholders as craig mentioned our board just announced an increase in our targeted dividend payout ratio from what was  to now  with that we announced a  increase on our quarterly dividend which equates to an annual dividend of  our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to be evidenced by the investments we are making in our business and the cash return to shareholders we thank you for your participation in todays call and catherine we are now ready for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and as a reminder please limit yourself to one question with one followup our first question will come from simeon gutman with morgan stanley simeon ari gutman  morgan stanley  co llc thanks good morning and congratulations on the results my first question is on the – i guess the balance between the samestore sales guidance and the gross margin guidance how should we think about market share gains in that  versus the mix of product andor i dont know if its promotion but just maybe mix of product and maybe being more aggressive in the appliance area craig a menear  the home depot inc yeah so ill start and ill let carol comment when you look at the projected margin as weve said were intending to lean into growth in categories that are lowermargin rate categories like appliances but also as our pro business continues to grow with categories in building materials and so thats really what were looking at as it relates to the gross margin and if you think about the last two years gross margin has roughly been about  basis points with the  basis points next year thats about a  basis point decline and we kind of consider that to be pretty flat carol b tomé  the home depot inc and maybe ill just add a little color about our sales forecasting model as you know it starts with gdp growth forecasts and for the us gdp is projected to grow by  in  we then add to that the benefits we believe we will get from rising home prices housing turnover and household formation and we think housing will add another pointandahalf growth to our overall growth next year to that we have added a little bit of share shift in appliances and certain building categories and just to put that in perspective in  appliances contributed  basis points of our comp growth so that gives you a sense of the share that were including in our guidance and then were adding something else this year that we havent included in the past and thats what we call the cumulative wealth effect of home price appreciation if you look at home equity since  home equity is up  on average that equates to  per household and we believe thats contributing – as people use the equity of their house to spend back into their house we believe thats contributing to our growth so we factor that into our guidance and thats how we got to the  simeon ari gutman  morgan stanley  co llc got it okay thats helpful my followup on sga i think the guidance suggests that the dollars grow i guess  relative to sales and of course home depot has had a strong bias to do better than its expense guidance over the years as you look – as we look out to next year is there anything in the mix that would prohibit or prevent you from maybe upside is there anything more structural about the complexion of sga next year carol b tomé  the home depot inc so let me walk you through how we got to our guidance for  as we commented in  our expenses grew at  of our sales growth rate a bit of that was distorted because of payment data breach expenses that were incurred in  and did not repeat in  so if you ignore the payment data breach our expenses in  grew at about  – call it  of our sales growth rate its stepping up to  in  for a few reasons we like many companies are facing rising wages as well as higher medical costs and we have factored that into our guidance it doesnt mean that we wont drive productivity to offset some of that pressure like we have historically but we have factored that into our guidance further were seeing some cost pressure coming in from property taxes in certain states like california so we factored that into our guidance and finally because our capital spending is stepping up slightly year on year theres a bit of expense associated with that but as you know productivity is a virtuous cycle at the home depot so we always try to do better simeon ari gutman  morgan stanley  co llc okay thank you operator thank you our next question will come from seth sigman with credit suisse seth i sigman  credit suisse securities usa llc thanks good morning guys congrats on the quarter craig a menear  the home depot inc thank you seth i sigman  credit suisse securities usa llc my first question is about interline i may have missed it but what are you assuming for growth of that channel and as you think about the integration it sounds like the initial rollout of the catalog thats gone well in the early testing can you give us a sense of what youve seen maybe a lift or just the change in behavior as youve added that catalog to the store thank you carol b tomé  the home depot inc well ill start with the growth assumptions and then we can talk about the performance on the growth assumptions we are assuming that interline will grow faster than the company average in  which was true in the fourth quarter as well but remember interline is less than  of our total sales so it just rounds out at the end of the day and thats why our comp sales guidance is the same as our total sales guidance for  craig a menear  the home depot inc and we are – were excited about the opportunities with interline it is a  billion market opportunity across multifamily hospitality and institutional which we own about  give or take of that market so its a significant opportunity for us to continue our share of wallet with our pro customer and as you called out we talked about the first use case is allowing our stores to purchase the interline product the next thing were working on is allowing our interline customers to be able to buy product through home depot or homedepotcom on their account and that were focused on here in  seth i sigman  credit suisse securities usa llc okay and i guess as a followup youve discussed pfri a lot over the years and the importance for your business pfri it decelerated quite a bit in  particularly towards the back half in yearoveryear terms obviously that disconnects with home depots performance which accelerated do you think thats market share maybe tying in one of the earlier questions or do you think the mix of the business is changing in a way thats just – perhaps the underlying drivers of your business are changing a bit too carol b tomé  the home depot inc i think pfri is a great indicator of the health of the overall market and as you can see it is a healthy market we are a big part of it arent we because improvements – if you look at the components of pfri improvements is one of the big components and were part of improvements so in a way its a bit circular im not sure that its a great predictive tool but it certainly is a great indicator of the health now heres a really fun fact – and i know you know this because youve done all the research in this area if pfri were to return to the mean of  and gdp remain the same wed have to grow about  and assuming theres no share shift for the home depot thats a  billion opportunity for us so will we get all those sales i dont know but it certainly suggests as the housing market continues to recover theres growth ahead for the home depot seth i sigman  credit suisse securities usa llc okay thank you for that operator well continue on to christopher horvers with jpmorgan chase christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc thanks good morning craig a menear  the home depot inc good morning christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc question on the cadence in the year how are we thinking about comps you just blew through what was supposed to be a very difficult comparison and didnt have any impact at all how are you thinking about the spring setup this year and then the overall cadence comps carol b tomé  the home depot inc well as you know we like to look at our business from a half and not a quarter because of what we call the bathtub effect youre never really sure when spring will land if we look at the split by half we would expect the first half to be slightly lower than the backhalf of the year as you know were up against a tough comparison in the first quarter particularly the month of february where last year we had a us comp of  i will tell you chris we planned for a positive comp in february we are beating our plan its early in the quarter of course but were feeling very good about our business christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc thats excellent on the gross margin does the outlook reflect any i guess slowing supply chain benefits or other pressures like ocean freight and then related to that inventories were flat in  should we see the expansion in  with project sync craig a menear  the home depot inc so on the gross margin we certainly are seeing some pressure from fuel yearoveryear and mark holifield is here can comment but certainly we expect to see some of that pressure in the year but we will continue to get productivity through our supply chain and then well invest that back into the business mark holifield  the home depot inc yeah craig its mark holifield here on fuel yes fuel does look like its firming up we use the department of energy to base our plans the forecast there is  against what it was in   and right now were at about  but thats incorporated in our guidance in terms of the sync and continued benefit we do see continued benefit coming from that as we continue to synchronize the activities between our vendors our carriers our distribution centers and our stores we are looking into a firming transportation market a bit but we do expect that well be able to offset those things with the benefits that we get from our initiatives carol b tomé  the home depot inc on the working capital front we expect working capital to be a source of cash for the business in  and were planning for inventory turns to improve twotenths yearonyear christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc thanks very much have a great spring craig a menear  the home depot inc thank you operator well now hear from michael lasser with ubs michael louis lasser  ubs securities llc good morning thanks a lot for my – taking my question carol can you describe the thought process behind recalibrating the model that you use to predict your sales outlook for the year by adding a component based on the wealth effect some of the skeptics might argue that anytime you have to recalibrate your model this far into a cycle that might be a sign of the top especially when perhaps one could argue youre doublecounting the housing impact because you do have a housing component already and then if you add another that weights  pricing carol b tomé  the home depot inc well first of all i will say its a minor change about fourtenths of growth yearonyear secondly our forecasting model is directionally correct but at the beginning of  it certainly didnt predict a  comp in the united states so we use all these factors to build a model to give us a sense of where were going theres another factor out there that we look at but we havent incorporated but were spending more time trying to understand and thats the leading indicator of remodeling activity thats published by the harvard joint center for housing studies if you look at that and im sure you have you can see that its suggesting growth rates higher than the guidance that weve provided so no matter how we look at it were very confident with the sales forecast that weve given michael louis lasser  ubs securities llc thats helpful and my other question is on your gross margin outlook for the upcoming year and really your promotional posture it seems like youre leaning in and taking advantage of some of the market share opportunities that are going to be afforded to you but how do you balance between suppressing the profitability of the category and gaining your fair share so you could lead in be a little more aggressive on some of the promotions but if thats what the customer is now conditioned to expect you may never be able to get that profitability back even if you did pick up some market share in the process craig a menear  the home depot inc i think its important to understand that the margin forecast that were projecting is really much more around the mix of our business and whats growing in the mix of our business teds here he can comment were not looking to drive additional promotional activity per se this is all about we continue to see categories like appliances gain traction in the market we continue to see our pro customer engage in bigger projects and remodeling those carry lower rate businesses but drive higher gross margin dollars which is why we get the productivity on the operating margin line edward p decker  the home depot inc yeah michael this is ted i wouldnt say our share gains are coming on the back of promotional productivity appliances is certainly one category that is promotional and we do participate in those promotions and have happily taken a lot of share but the balance of the business we have been very focused on everyday low pricing and bringing everyday low prices as you know we have a very strong pro business and you need to be priced right every day when the pro comes into the store so the market share gains are happening across the building and thats the balance that we appreciate the most about it and other than appliances we have not been leaning into promotions albeit the marketplace in general has been a bit more promotional that gives us more confidence to support our everyday low price positioning carol b tomé  the home depot inc one other data point if i may if you look at sales by category peak to trough while weve more than fully recovered everything we lost during the downturn we havent recovered every category we still have  billion of sales that havent fully recovered and those are in lowmargin categories we want that to grow and if housing continues to grow it will michael louis lasser  ubs securities llc thank you so much operator thank you well go to scott mushkin with wolfe research cody t ross  wolfe research llc hi this is cody actually on for scott today thanks for taking our question your pro business continues to deliver exceptional performance what is driving that performance and can you update us on some of the initiatives youre running craig a menear  the home depot inc i mean bill and ted can comment on the pro business bill lennie  the home depot inc well were – this is bill lennie just a comment on pro activity were seeing a great balance between our lowspend and our highspend pro good health in the business being driven both by transactions more transactions and ticket so it just says that weve got great activity in the stores and as ted said the drivers for the pro are just instock and everyday value on the shelf so its just health across the business across multiple categories edward p decker  the home depot inc yeah i cody t ross  wolfe research llc great yeah lets  – continue edward p decker  the home depot inc sure this is ted the other thing that we continue to focus on is certainly being instock and having great value every day we also strive to have the brands that the pros want and the innovative product that we seek to deliver and this happens throughout the store for example were launching an even lighter drywall this quarter its  lighter which helps the pro complete their jobs and saves them time and certainly a lot of backache the milwaukee outdoor power equipment this is pro runtime and power without the need of obviously messy fuels so a lot of this is product and value that our merchants strive to bring every day for the pro customer cody t ross  wolfe research llc great thank you and many believe theres a lot of significant pentup demand out there that will drive growth in housing in  as you guys alluded to as well however rates are expected to rise is there a rate that you guys beginning to get worried and how do you balance that pentup demand versus the expected increase in rates thank you carol b tomé  the home depot inc yeah our analysis would show that for every basis point increase in mortgage rates it costs the homeowner whos applied for a mortgage  more per month so that helps sort of dimensionalize the pressure associated with rising rates with the median home price in the country of  mortgage rates could go up to ish percent before the affordability index would fall at  or below so theres  a way to go before wed be concerned and you know what mortgage rates stand today at   something like that the historical mean is  so even if a return to the mean youre still below that inflection point cody t ross  wolfe research llc understood thank you very much and best of luck craig a menear  the home depot inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from dan binder with jefferies daniel thomas binder  jefferies llc great thank you just sticking with the pro for a minute i know youve highlighted product value credit delivery im just curious when you listen to the pro how much of the advantage do you have really lies with the store base the density of the store base the convenience of the store base in the markets craig a menear  the home depot inc i mean theres pro business across all markets we actually look at the penetration of our pro business on a storebystore basis and this isnt tied to a specific market its a broadbased approach that weve taken in the business candidly from the very beginning of home depot carol b tomé  the home depot inc we joke we are pro daniel thomas binder  jefferies llc and then in a quarter i hate to even bring it up but the shrinks was up a bit i was just curious if there was anything that you would attribute to that carol b tomé  the home depot inc i wouldnt read anything to shrink for the year shrink was up  basis point this is just a yearoveryear comparison daniel thomas binder  jefferies llc and then the last question if i could given the strength in ecommerce is there any implications on the profitability or profit headwind as the ecommerce business grows within the broader mix of the sales craig a menear  the home depot inc yeah as we have shared in the past we actually think about this as one business thats the way the customer thinks about it and so we handle this from a portfolio approach and we look at a blended operation because thats really where the customer is taking us with  of our orders being picked up instore daniel thomas binder  jefferies llc okay thanks operator thank you we will continue to dennis mcgill with zelman  associates dennis patrick mcgill  zelman partners llc hi good morning thank you craig a menear  the home depot inc good morning dennis patrick mcgill  zelman partners llc curious if you could elaborate a little bit on the flooring category its been an area i think just in general in home improvement that hasnt been very robust even within your relative performance and to see that as a doubledigit category hoping you can maybe explain a little bit what was driving that edward p decker  the home depot inc sure youve heard us talk over the last several quarters about our investments in hard surface materials and those businesses continue to do very well with laminate very strong were getting great product innovation on vinyl flooring so todays vinyl flooring is not the s and s kitchens laminate in – or vinyl rather and so youre starting to see whats called luxury vinyl plank introduced into many use cases tile continues to perform very well but the thing that is really working for us right now is the soft side you havent heard us talk about the soft side in some time our hard set has been doing great for several quarters and were now seeing the soft side pick up very significantly so we have both ends of that business working for us right now which is what produced the doubledigit comps dennis patrick mcgill  zelman partners llc and that acceleration ted from third quarter to fourth quarter was on the soft side and was there any type of promotion or installed promotiondriven – driving that edward p decker  the home depot inc no no promotion at all dennis patrick mcgill  zelman partners llc okay and then carol on the capital spending plan of  billion in the grand scheme of things i guess its not that much but up from  billion in  how much of that is definitely coming through versus things that might be planned and could potentially be pushed out and just wanted to make sure thats the right comparison the  billion to the  billion carol b tomé  the home depot inc the comparison is correct we are planning to spend the capital that we are guiding to of  billion its about  of sales and as you think about capital for our business going forward if you want to model  of sales i think that would be a good number to use were investing in the initiatives that weve shared with you be it interconnected retail supply chain we are also investing into our stores as craig pointed out  of our online orders are picked up inside of our stores that means we need to do some reconfiguration to hold those orders and make sure the experience is right we did a lot of work with our customers this summer and got some good feedback from our customers about things we could do differently in our stores so  of our stores will be receiving what we call a new store environment  lighting the floors are going to be polished up the stores are relevant we want to keep them that dennis patrick mcgill  zelman partners llc okay thats helpful and carol you mentioned the breach cost i think in the fourth quarter is that right and so do you have a number carol b tomé  the home depot inc its  million in the quarter  million for the year  million life to date and i think were done were happy about that dennis patrick mcgill  zelman partners llc okay appreciate it thanks guys good luck carol b tomé  the home depot inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from matt fassler with goldman sachs matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co thanks so much sorry thanks so much and good morning can you guys hear me craig a menear  the home depot inc good morning yes carol b tomé  the home depot inc yes matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co great my first question relates to capital allocation we obviously took note of both the dividend hike and the change in the payout ratio as well as the new buyback authorization over the past couple of years youve bought back more stock than you had initially guided to can you talk about whether the higher payout ratio would change your ability or your inclination to do so i guess if the price was right of course and also just remind us of the leverage targets that youre thinking about craig a menear  the home depot inc i think weve guided at the beginning of each year based on the cash flow projections that we have for the business we still have a target of  times debt to ebitdar ratio that is something that our board is comfortable with so its possible that we could expand carol b tomé  the home depot inc yeah if you look at where the adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio stands today theres  billion of borrowing availability its not our intent to let that ratio decline which it will if we dont lever back up the interest rate environment is still very attractive were very pleased with how weve utilized debt financing to supplement our cash to buy back our share so certainly not suggesting that anything is going to change off of our past practice matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co and then – thank you for that and then my second question my second question – thank you for that my second question relates to big ticket in the fourth quarter so this was the third straight year that your big ticket comp was strongest in q and obviously youve been putting up amazing multiyear comps in aggregate in q but big ticket seems to be the biggest driver if you would talk about either changes in your selling push or in buying patterns is it better traction in appliances is it the pro push in q is it marketing across a broad array of seasons what is it that is driving your transactions over  to such a great degree in q more so than over the rest of the year edward p decker  the home depot inc sure matt id say first of all that what we really like in the business is the balance so as carol and craig said our comp in the us stores was  in q it was  for the year we have an even balance of ticket and transactions in the fourth quarter it was roughly  for each of ticket and transaction were getting growth in our small ticket were getting the growth that youre asking about in big ticket and were also seeing an increase in items per basket so just that breadth of performance across the store we like very much whats driving the outsize gains for another quarter in big ticket is really you named them so we continue to drive the appliance business in the fourth quarter appliance has become a big selling period but traditionally the black friday period in retail our flooring business that i talked about helped drive that ticket and then the broad strength of the pro across the entire store is the third large element driving that outsize comp in big ticket matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co understood thank you so much ted appreciate it diane dayhoff  the home depot inc catherine we have time for one more question operator thank you and our final question today will come from seth basham with wedbush securities seth m basham  wedbush securities inc thanks a lot and good morning edward p decker  the home depot inc good morning craig a menear  the home depot inc good morning seth m basham  wedbush securities inc my question is around sga specifically labor optimization you mentioned this in the past as a potential initiative for  if you can provide update on how you are thinking about it now that would be helpful craig a menear  the home depot inc yeah and when it comes to optimizing were looking at that across multiple aspects of our business we on occasion look at the structure within our business and we have organizational changes this past year for example we brought together our online and marketing teams because thats really the direction of where the business is going so were continually looking at how do we optimize and drive productivity within our business around the sga carol b tomé  the home depot inc and certainly craig you commented on what were doing with freight inside the store craig a menear  the home depot inc yes and this is an area that in  really is the first year that weve begun to focus on freight handling inside our stores its an area of opportunity for us as we continue to leverage the work that weve begun with supply chain sync but really optimize how we flow product inside the stores ive talked about in the past that what well ultimately have to get to in our stores is handling product inside the buildings as efficiently as we do in our dcs seth m basham  wedbush securities inc got it so as you look at the forecast for sga growth in  does it contemplate much in the way of labor productivity savings carol b tomé  the home depot inc no material change to what youve seen in the past several years seth m basham  wedbush securities inc all right thank you so much diane dayhoff  the home depot inc well thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you on our first quarter earnings call in
