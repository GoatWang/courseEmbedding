langley st duke of york st earl of cambridge kg  june  –  august  was a younger son of king edward iii of england and philippa of hainault the fourth of their five sons who lived to adulthood he was the founder of the house of york but it was through the marriage of his younger son richard to anne mortimer that the yorkist faction in the wars of the roses made its claim on the throne the other party in the wars of the roses the lancasters were descendants of edmunds elder brother john of gaunt whose son henry usurped the throne of richard ii in  edmund had two sons edward and richard of conisburgh edward succeeded to the dukedom in  but was killed at the battle of agincourt in  with no issue richard married anne mortimer a greatgranddaughter of lionel of antwerp the second son cadet line of edward iii furthermore annes son richard also became heir general to the earldom of march after her only brother edmund th earl died without issue in  their father roger mortimer th earl of march had been named heir presumptive of richard ii before henry ivs accession although it had been passed over at the time annes son richard also inherited this claim to the throne richard of conisburgh was executed following his involvement in the southampton plot to depose henry v of england in favour of the earl of march the dukedom of york therefore passed to his son richard plantagenet through his mother richard plantagenet also inherited the lands of the earldom of march as well as the mortimer claim to the throne key house of york edward iii king of england – lionel st

england mary wars of the rosesedit main article wars of the roses despite his elevated status richard plantagenet was denied a position in government by the advisers of the weak henry vi particularly john beaufort st duke of somerset and the queen consort margaret of anjou although he served as protector of the realm during henry vis period of incapacity in  his reforms were reversed by somersets party once the king had recovered the wars of the roses began the following year with the first battle of st albans initially richard aimed only to purge his lancastrian political opponents from positions of influence over the king it was not until october  that he claimed the throne for the house of york in that year the yorkists had captured the king at the battle of northampton but victory was shortlived richard and his second son edmund were killed at the battle of wakefield on  december richards claim to the throne was inherited by his son edward with the support of richard neville th earl of warwick the kingmaker edward already showing great promise as a leader of men defeated the lancastrians in a succession of battles while henry vi and margaret of anjou were campaigning in the north warwick gained control of the capital and had edward declared king in london in  edward strengthened his claim with a decisive victory at the battle of towton in the same year in the course of which the lancastrian army was virtually wiped out reigns of the yorkist kingsedit the early reign of edward iv was marred by lancastrian plotting and uprisings in favour of henry vi warwick himself changed sides and supported margaret of anjou and the kings jealous brother george duke of clarence in briefly restoring henry in  however edward regained his throne and the house of lancaster was wiped out with the death of henry vi himself in the tower of london in  in  the continued trouble caused by clarence led to his execution in the tower of london popularly he is thought to have been drowned in a butt of malmsey wine on edwards death in  the crown passed to his twelveyearold son edward edward ivs younger brother richard duke of gloucester was appointed protector and escorted the young king and his brother richard to the tower of london the famous princes in the tower were never seen again however it is unknown whether they were killed or who killed them if it happened parliament declared in the document titulus regius that the two boys were illegitimate on the grounds that edward ivs marriage was invalid and as such richard was heir to the throne he was crowned richard iii in july  defeat of the house of yorkedit richard iii had many enemies though the house of lancaster had been extinguished the lancastrian sympathisers survived who now rallied behind henry tudor a descendant of the beauforts a legitimized branch of the house of lancaster moreover the family of edward iv and the edwardian loyalists were naturally opposed to him essentially dividing his yorkist power base a coup attempt failed in late  but in  richard met henry tudor at the battle of bosworth field during the battle some of richards important supporters switched sides or withheld their retainers from the field richard himself was killed he was the last of the plantagenet kings as well as the last english king to die in battle henry tudor declared himself king took elizabeth of york eldest child of edward iv as his wife symbolically uniting the surviving houses of york and lancaster and acceded to the throne as henry vii founder of the tudor dynasty which reigned until  later claimantsedit see also alternative successions of the english crown the de la pole family were sometimes suggested as heirs to the yorkist cause but henry tudor and his son henry viii of england efficiently suppressed all such opposition another yorkist branch descends from george plantagenet st duke of clarence and younger brother of edward iv the heir to this branch is the earl of loudoun currently simon abneyhastings there was in edward ivs reign a suspicion that this king was illegitimate in  the british station channel  revived the george branchs claim as britains real monarch the earls of loudoun would then at least be the heirs to the yorkists legacyedit upon henry tudors uniting the rival houses of lancaster and york the title duke of york became a royal prerogative and is traditionally accorded to the second son of the reigning monarch beginning with richard of shrewsbury son of edward iv one of the princes in the tower none of its holders were able to transmit it they either died without a male heir or succeeded to the throne the title is held today by prince andrew second son of queen elizabeth ii and her consort prince philip duke of edinburgh the symbol of the house of york was a white rose still used as the badge of yorkshire and jacobitism york pennsylvania is known as the white rose city after the symbol of the house of york the rivalry between york and lancaster in the modern form of the counties of yorkshire and lancashire has continued into the present day on a more friendly basis dukes of yorkedit duke portrait birth marriages death edmund of

symbolism white is the symbol of light typifying innocence and purity joy and glory during the civil wars of the fifteenth century the white rose was the symbol of yorkist forces opposed to the rival house of lancaster the red rose of lancaster would be a later invention used to represent the house of lancaster but was not in use during the actual conflict the opposition of the two roses gave the wars their name the wars of the roses coined in the th century white rose badge of york sun of york rose en soleil badge of york white lion of mortimer badge of edward iv falcon and fetterlock badge

losecoat field barnet tewkesbury bosworth field stoke field the wars of the roses were a series of wars for control of the throne of england fought between supporters of two rival branches of the royal house of plantagenet the house of lancaster associated with a red rose and the house of york whose symbol was a white rose the conflict lasted through many sporadic episodes between  and  however there was fighting before and after this period between the houses the power struggle ignited around social and financial troubles following the hundred years war combined with the mental infirmity and weak rule of henry vi which revived interest in richard of yorks claim to the throne historians disagree about whether the wars of the roses were caused by the structural problems of bastard feudalism or henry vis ineffectiveness as king with the duke of yorks death the claim transferred to his heir edward who later became the first yorkist king of england as edward iv his son reigned for  days as edward v but parliament then decided that edward and his brother richard were illegitimate and offered the crown to edward ivs younger brother who became richard iii the two young princes disappeared within the confines of the tower of london the final victory went to a claimant of the lancastrian party henry tudor earl of richmond who defeated the last yorkist king richard iii

associated with the two royal houses the white rose of york and the red rose of lancaster wars of the roses came into common use in the nineteenth century after the publication in  of anne of geierstein by sir walter scott scott based the name on a scene in william shakespeares play henry vi part  set in the gardens of the temple church where a number of noblemen and a lawyer pick red or white roses to show their loyalty to the lancastrian or yorkist faction respectively the yorkist faction used the symbol of the white rose from early in the conflict but the lancastrian red rose was apparently introduced only after the victory of henry tudor at the battle of bosworth when it was combined with the yorkist white rose to form the tudor rose which symbolised the union of the two houses the origins of the rose as a cognizance itself stem from edward is use of a golden rose stalked proper often owing to nobles holding multiple titles more than one badge was used edward iv for example used both his sun in splendour as earl of march but also his fathers falcon and fetterlock as duke of york badges were not always distinct at the battle of barnet edwards sun was very similar to the earl of oxfords vere star which caused fateful confusion most but not all of the participants in the wars wore livery badges associated with their immediate lords or patrons under the prevailing system of bastard feudalism the wearing of livery was by now confined to those in continuous employ of a lord thus excluding for example mercenaries another example henry tudors forces at bosworth fought under the banner of a red dragon while the yorkist army used richard iiis personal device of a white boar although the names of the rival houses derive from the cities of york and lancaster the corresponding duchies had little to do with these cities the lands and offices attached to the duchy of lancaster were mainly in gloucestershire north wales and cheshire while the estates and castles that were part of the duchy of york were spread throughout england and wales although many were in the welsh marches summary of eventsedit this section does not cite any sources

in the wars of the roses although minor armed clashes had occurred previously between supporters of york and lancaster the first open fighting broke out in  at the first battle of st albans several prominent lancastrians died at the hands of the yorkists although peace was temporarily restored the lancastrians were inspired by margaret of anjou to contest yorks influence and a deadly feud between the two branches of the royal family ensued fighting resumed more violently in  york and his supporters were forced to flee the country but one of his most prominent supporters the earl of warwick invaded england from calais and captured henry vi at the battle of northampton york returned to the country and became protector of england but was dissuaded from claiming the throne margaret and the remaining lancastrian nobles gathered their army in the north of england when york moved north to engage them he and his second son edmund were killed at the battle of wakefield in december  the lancastrian army advanced south and released henry at the second battle of st albans but failed to occupy london and subsequently retreated to the north yorks eldest son edward earl of march was proclaimed king edward iv he gathered the yorkist armies and won a crushing victory at the battle of towton in march  after lancastrian revolts in the north were suppressed in  and henry was captured once again and placed in the tower of london edward fell out with his chief supporter and adviser the earl of warwick known as the kingmaker after edwards unpopular and secretly conducted marriage with the widow of a lancastrian supporter elizabeth woodville within a few years it became clear that edward was favoring his wifes family and alienating a number of friends closely aligned with warwick as well a nearcontemporary flemish picture of the battle of barnet in  furious warwick tried first to supplant edward with his younger brother george duke of clarence establishing the alliance by marriage to his daughter isabel neville when that plan failed due to lack of support from parliament warwick sailed to france with his family and made an alliance with the lancastrian queen margaret of anjou to restore henry vi to the throne this resulted in two years of rapid changes of fortune before edward iv once again won complete victories at barnet april  where warwick was killed and tewkesbury may  where the lancastrian heir edward of westminster prince of wales was killed or perhaps executed after the battle queen margaret was escorted to london as a prisoner and henry was murdered in the tower of london several days later ending the direct lancastrian line of succession a period of comparative peace followed ending with the unexpected death of king edward in  his surviving brother richard duke of gloucester first moved to prevent the unpopular woodville family of edwards widow from participating in the government during the minority of edwards son edward v and then seized the throne for himself using the suspect legitimacy of edward ivs marriage as pretext henry tudor a distant relative of the lancastrian kings who had inherited their claim defeated richard iii at bosworth in  he was crowned henry vii and married elizabeth of york daughter of edward iv to unite and reconcile the two houses yorkist revolts directed by john de la pole st earl of lincoln and others flared up in  under the banner of the pretender lambert simnel—who claimed he was edward earl of warwick son of george of clarence resulting in the last pitched battles though most surviving descendants of richard of york were imprisoned sporadic rebellions continued until  when perkin warbeck who claimed he was the younger brother of edward v one of the two disappeared princes in the tower was imprisoned and later executed origins of the conflictedit disputed successionedit william the conquerors son king henry i of england died in  after his only male heir was killed aboard the white ship following the white ship disaster england entered a period of prolonged instability known as the anarchy however following the ascension of henry ii plantagenet to the throne in  the crown passed from father to son or brother to brother with little difficulty until  henry iv the question of succession after edward iiis death in  is said to be the cause of the wars of roses although edward iii had five legitimate sons there was a sudden narrowing in the direct line of descent near the end of his reign edwards eldest son edward the black prince had died the year before the black princes own eldest son edward of angoulême had died in  edward iii was succeeded on the throne by the black princes younger son richard ii who was only  years old richards claim to the throne was based on the principle that the son of an elder brother had priority in the succession over his uncles since richard was a minor and had three living uncles at the time of edward iiis death there was considerable uncertainty about who was next in line for the succession by custom roger mortimer who claimed descent from king edward through his mother philippa of clarence edward iiis eldest grandchild had the best claim to succeed however a legal decree issued by edward iii in  had introduced some complexity into the question of who would ultimately take the throne the letters patent issued by edward iii limited the right of succession to male heirs which placed richards uncle john of gaunt duke of lancaster and his male descendants ahead of philippas male children in the succession richard iis reign was marked by increasing dissension between the king and several of the most powerful nobles in  he exiled gaunts son henry of bolingbroke richards government had become highly unpopular beyond his strongholds in cheshire and wales and when bolingbroke returned from exile in  initially to reclaim his rights as duke of lancaster he took advantage of the support of most of the nobles to depose richard and was crowned king henry iv establishing the house of lancaster on the throne house of lancasteredit henry v henry ivs claim to the throne was through his father john of gaunt third surviving son of edward iii the childless richard ii had nominated edmund mortimer th earl of march as his successor but there was little support at the time for the counterclaim of the young mortimer as henrys initial popularity waned the mortimer familys claim to the throne was a pretext for the major rebellion of owain glyndŵr in wales and other less successful revolts in cheshire and northumberland there were uprisings in support of the mortimers claim throughout henry ivs reign which lasted until  an important branch of the house of lancaster were the beauforts who were descended from gaunt by his mistress katherine swynford when gaunt and katherine later married their descendants were made legitimate by an act of parliament however henry iv excluded them from the line of succession to the throne henry ivs son and successor henry v inherited a temporarily pacified nation and his military success against france in the hundred years war bolstered his popularity enabling him to strengthen the lancastrian hold on the throne nevertheless one notable conspiracy against henry the southampton plot took place during his nineyear reign this was led by richard earl of cambridge who was executed for treason in  at the start of the campaign that led to the battle of agincourt house of yorkedit the founder of the house of york was edmund of langley the fourth son of edward iii and the younger brother of john of gaunt his son richard earl of cambridge had married anne de mortimer the mortimers were members of the most powerful marcher family of the fourteenth century gm trevelyan has written that the wars of the roses were to a large extent a quarrel between welsh marcer lords who were also great english nobles closely related to the english throne anne herself was descended from edward iii through her mother philippa of clarence daughter of lionel of antwerp edwards second son anne mortimers husband richard earl of cambridge anne had died in  when her brother edmund earl of march who had loyally supported henry died childless in  the title and extensive estates of the earldom of march and the mortimer claim to the throne thus passed to annes descendants richard of york the son of cambridge and anne mortimer was four years old at the time of his fathers execution although cambridge was attainted henry v later allowed richard to inherit the title and lands of cambridges elder brother edward duke of york who had died fighting alongside henry at agincourt and had no issue henry who had three younger brothers and was himself in his prime and recently married to the french princess catherine of valois had no doubt that the lancastrian right to the crown was secure henrys premature death in  at the age of  led to his only son henry vi coming to the throne as an infant and the country being ruled by regents henry vs younger brothers produced no surviving legitimate issue leaving only distant cousins the beauforts as alternative lancaster heirs as richard of york grew into maturity and questions were raised over henry vis fitness to rule richards claim to the throne thus became more significant the revenue from the york and march estates also made him the wealthiest magnate in the land henry viedit from early childhood henry vi was surrounded by quarrelsome councillors and advisors his younger surviving paternal uncle humphrey duke of gloucester sought to be named protector and deliberately courted the popularity of the common people for his own ends but was opposed by cardinal beaufort on several occasions beaufort called on john duke of bedford humphreys older brother to return from his post as regent in france either to mediate or to defend him against humphreys accusations of treason some time after bedford died in  cardinal beaufort withdrew from public affairs partly due to old age and partly because william de la pole st duke of suffolk rose to become the dominant personality at court suffolk was widely held to be enriching himself through his influence on henry and was blamed for mismanaging the government and poorly executing the continuing hundred years war with france under henry vi all the land in france won by henry v and even the provinces of guienne and gascony which had been held since the reign of henry ii three centuries previously were lost henry vi suffolk eventually succeeded in having humphrey of gloucester arrested for treason humphrey died while awaiting trial in prison at bury st edmunds in  some authorities date the start of the war of the roses from the death of humphrey however with severe reverses in france suffolk was stripped of office and was murdered on his way to exile edmund beaufort nd duke of somerset succeeded him as leader of the party seeking peace with france the duke of york who had succeeded bedford as lieutenant in france meanwhile represented those who wished to prosecute the war more vigorously and criticised the court and somerset in particular for starving him of funds and men during his campaigns in france in all these quarrels henry vi had taken little part he was seen as a weak ineffectual king in addition he displayed several symptoms of mental illness that he may have inherited from his maternal grandfather charles vi of france by  many considered henry incapable of carrying out the duties and responsibilities of a king in  there was a violent popular revolt in kent jack cades rebellion which is often seen as the prelude to the wars of the roses the rebel manifesto the complaint of the poor commons of kent was written under cades leadership it accused the crown of extortion perversion of justice and election fraud the rebels occupied parts of london and executed james fiennes st baron saye and sele the unpopular lord high treasurer after a hasty trial after some of them fell to looting they were driven out of london by the citizens they dispersed after they were supposedly pardoned but several including cade were later executed after the rebellion the rebels grievances formed the basis of richard of yorks opposition of a royal government from which he felt excluded two years later in  richard of york returned to england from his new post as lieutenant of ireland and marched on london demanding somersets removal and reform of the government at this stage few of the nobles supported such drastic action and york was forced to submit to superior force at blackheath he was imprisoned for much of  and  but was released after swearing not to take arms against the court the increasing discord at court was mirrored in the country as a whole where noble families engaged in private feuds and showed increasing disrespect for the royal authority and for the courts of law in many cases feuds were fought between oldestablished families and formerly minor nobility raised in power and influence by henry iv in the aftermath of the rebellions against him the quarrel between the percys—long the earls of northumberland—and the comparatively upstart nevilles was the bestknown of these private wars and followed this pattern as did the bonville–courtenay feud in cornwall and devon a factor in these feuds was the presence of large numbers of soldiers discharged from the english armies that had been defeated in france nobles engaged many of these to mount raids or to pack courts of justice with their supporters intimidating suitors witnesses and judges this growing civil discontent the abundance of feuding nobles with private armies and corruption in henry vis court formed a political climate ripe for civil war with the king so easily manipulated power rested with those closest to him at court in other words somerset and the lancastrian faction richard and the yorkist faction who tended to be physically placed further away from the seat of power found their power slowly being stripped away royal power and finances also started to slip as henry was persuaded to grant many royal lands and estates to the lancastrians thereby losing their revenue in  henry suffered the first of several bouts of complete mental collapse during which he failed even to recognise his newborn son edward of westminster on  march  cardinal john kemp the chancellor died henry was incapable of nominating a successor to ensure that the country could be governed a council of regency was set up headed by the duke of york who still remained popular with the people as lord protector york soon asserted his power with evergreater boldness although there is no proof that he had aspirations to the throne at this early stage he imprisoned somerset and backed his neville allies his brotherinlaw the earl of salisbury and salisburys son the earl of warwick in their continuing feud with the earl of northumberland a powerful supporter of henry henry recovered in  and once again fell under the influence of those closest to him at court directed by henrys queen the powerful and aggressive margaret of anjou who emerged as the de facto leader of the lancastrians richard was forced out of court margaret built up an alliance against richard and conspired with other nobles to reduce his influence an increasingly thwarted richard who feared arrest for treason finally resorted to armed hostilities in  start of the waredit the lancastrian siege of london in  is attacked by a yorkist sally richard duke of york led a small force toward london and was met by henrys forces at st albans north of london on  may  the relatively small first battle of st albans was the first open conflict of the civil war richards aim was ostensibly to remove poor advisors from king henrys side the result was a lancastrian defeat several prominent lancastrian leaders including somerset and northumberland were killed after the battle the yorkists found henry hiding in a local tanners shop abandoned by his advisers and servants apparently having suffered another bout of mental illness he had also been slightly wounded in the neck by an arrow york and his allies regained their position of influence with the king indisposed york was again appointed protector and margaret was shunted aside charged with the kings care for a while both sides seemed shocked that an actual battle had been fought and did their best to reconcile their differences but the problems that caused conflict soon reemerged particularly the issue of whether the duke of york or henry and margarets infant son edward would succeed to the throne margaret refused to accept any solution that would disinherit her son and it became clear that she would only tolerate the situation for as long as the duke of york and his allies retained the military ascendancy henry recovered and in february  he relieved york of his office of protector in the autumn of that year henry went on royal progress in the midlands where the king and queen were popular margaret did not allow him to return to london where the merchants were angry at the decline in trade and the widespread disorder the kings court was set up at coventry by then the new duke of somerset was emerging as a favourite of the royal court margaret persuaded henry to revoke the appointments york had made as protector while york was made to return to his post as lieutenant in ireland disorder in the capital and the north of england where fighting between the nevilles and percys had resumed  and piracy by french fleets on the south coast were growing but the king and queen remained intent on protecting their own positions with the queen introducing conscription for the first time in england meanwhile yorks ally warwick later dubbed the kingmaker was growing in popularity in london as the champion of the merchants as captain of calais he had fought piracy in the channel in the spring of  thomas bourchier the archbishop of canterbury attempted to arrange a reconciliation the lords had gathered in london for a grand council and the city was full of armed retainers the archbishop negotiated complex settlements to resolve the bloodfeuds that had persisted since the battle of st albans then on lady day  march the king led a love day procession to st pauls cathedral with lancastrian and yorkist nobles following him hand in hand no sooner had the procession and the council dispersed than plotting resumed act of accordedit ludlow castle south shropshire the next outbreak of fighting was prompted by warwicks highhanded actions as captain of calais he led his ships in attacks on neutral hanseatic league and spanish ships in the channel on flimsy grounds of sovereignty he was summoned to london to face enquiries but he claimed that attempts had been made on his life and returned to calais york salisbury and warwick were summoned to a royal council at coventry but they refused fearing arrest when they were isolated from their own supporters york summoned the nevilles to join him at his stronghold at ludlow castle in the welsh marches on  september  at the battle of blore heath in staffordshire a lancastrian army failed to prevent salisbury from marching from middleham castle in yorkshire to ludlow shortly afterwards the combined yorkist armies confronted the much larger lancastrian force at the battle of ludford bridge warwicks contingent from the garrison of calais under andrew trollope defected to the lancastrians and the yorkist leaders fled york returned to ireland and his eldest son edward earl of march salisbury and warwick fled to calais the lancastrians were back in total control york and his supporters were attainted at the parliament of devils as traitors somerset was appointed governor of calais and was dispatched to take over the vital fortress on the french coast but his attempts to evict warwick were easily repulsed warwick and his supporters even began to launch raids on the english coast from calais adding to the sense of chaos and disorder being attainted only by a successful invasion could the yorkists recover their lands and titles warwick travelled to ireland to concert plans with york evading the royal ships commanded by the duke of exeter in late june  warwick salisbury and edward of march crossed the channel and rapidly established themselves in kent and london where they enjoyed wide support backed by a papal emissary who had taken their side they marched north king henry led an army south to meet them while margaret remained in the north with prince edward at the battle of northampton on  july the yorkist army under warwick defeated the lancastrians aided by treachery in the kings ranks for the second time in the war king henry was found by the yorkists in a tent abandoned by his retinue having apparently suffered another breakdown with the king in their possession the yorkists returned to london in the light of this military success richard of york moved to press his claim to the throne based on the illegitimacy of the lancastrian line landing in north wales he and his wife cecily entered london with all the ceremony usually reserved for a monarch parliament was assembled and when york entered he made straight for the throne which he may have been expecting the lords to encourage him to take for himself as they had acclaimed henry iv in  instead there was stunned silence york announced his claim to the throne but the lords even warwick and salisbury were shocked by his presumption they had no desire at this stage to overthrow king henry their ambition was still limited to the removal of his councillors the next day york produced detailed genealogies to support his claim based on his descent from lionel of antwerp duke of clarence yorks claim was through a daughter of a second son henrys through the son of a third son the judges felt that common law principles could not determine who had priority in the royal succession and declared the matter above the law and passed ther lernyng parliament agreed to consider the matter and accepted that yorks claim was better but by a majority of five they voted that henry vi should remain as king a compromise was struck in october  with the act of accord which recognised york as henrys successor disinheriting henrys sixyearold son edward york accepted this compromise as the best offer it gave him much of what he wanted particularly since he was also made protector of the realm and was able to govern in henrys name death of richard duke of yorkedit ruins of sandal castle near wakefield west yorkshire queen margaret and her son had fled to north wales parts of which were still in lancastrian hands they later travelled by sea to scotland to negotiate for scottish assistance mary of gueldres queen consort to james ii of scotland agreed to give margaret an army on condition that she cede the town of berwick to scotland and marys daughter be betrothed to prince edward margaret agreed although she had no funds to pay her army and could only promise booty from the riches of southern england as long as no looting took place north of the river trent the duke of york left london later that year with the earl of salisbury to consolidate his position in the north against the lancastrians who were reported to be massing near the city of york he took up a defensive position at sandal castle near wakefield over christmas  then on  december his forces left the castle and attacked the lancastrians in the open although outnumbered the ensuing battle of wakefield was a complete lancastrian victory richard of york was slain in the battle and both salisbury and yorks yearold second son edmund earl of rutland were captured and executed margaret ordered the heads of all three placed on the gates of york edwards claim to the throneedit parhelion at sunset the act of accord and the events of wakefield left the yearold edward earl of march yorks eldest son as duke of york and heir to his claim to the throne with an army from the proyorkist marches the border area between england and wales he met jasper tudors lancastrian army arriving from wales and he defeated them soundly at the battle of mortimers cross in herefordshire he inspired his men with a vision of three suns at dawn a phenomenon known as parhelion telling them that it was a portent of victory and represented the three surviving york sons himself george and richard this led to edwards later adoption of the sign of the sunne in splendour as his personal device margarets army was moving south supporting itself by looting as it passed through the prosperous south of england in london warwick used this as propaganda to reinforce yorkist support throughout the south – the town of coventry switched allegiance to the yorkists warwicks army established fortified positions north of the town of st albans to block the main road from the north but was outmanoeuvred by margarets army which swerved to the west and then attacked warwicks positions from behind at the second battle of st albans the lancastrians won another big victory as the yorkist forces fled they left behind king henry who was found unharmed sitting quietly beneath a tree henry knighted thirty lancastrian soldiers immediately after the battle in an illustration of the increasing bitterness of the war queen margaret instructed her sevenyearold son edward of westminster to determine the manner of execution of the yorkist knights who had been charged with keeping henry safe and had stayed at his side throughout the battle as the lancastrian army advanced southwards a wave of dread swept london where rumours were rife about savage northerners intent on plundering the city the people of london shut the city gates and refused to supply food to the queens army which was looting the surrounding counties of hertfordshire and middlesex yorkist triumphedit edward iv edward of march having joined with warwicks surviving forces advanced towards london from the west at the same time that the queen retreated northwards to dunstable as a result edward and warwick were able to enter london with their army they found considerable support there as the city was largely yorkistsupporting it was clear that edward was no longer simply trying to free the king from bad councillors but that his goal was to take the crown thomas kempe the bishop of london asked the people of london their opinion and they replied with shouts of king edward the request was quickly approved by parliament and edward was unofficially crowned in an impromptu ceremony at westminster abbey edward vowed that he would not have a formal coronation until henry vi and his wife were removed from the scene edward claimed henry had forfeited his right to the crown by allowing his queen to take up arms against his rightful heirs under the act of accord parliament had already accepted that edwards victory was simply a restoration of the rightful heir to the throne edward and warwick marched north gathering a large army as they went and met an equally impressive lancastrian army at towton the battle of towton near york was the biggest battle of the wars of the roses both sides agreed beforehand that the issue would be settled that day with no quarter asked or given an estimated – men took part with over  men being killed during and after the battle an enormous number for the time and the greatest recorded single days loss of life on english soil edward and his army won a decisive victory and the lancastrians were routed with most of their leaders slain henry and margaret who were waiting in york with their son edward fled north when they heard the outcome many of the surviving lancastrian nobles switched allegiance to king edward and those who did not were driven back to the northern border areas and a few castles in wales edward advanced to take york where he replaced the rotting heads of his father his brother and salisbury with those of defeated lancastrian lords such as the notorious john clifford th baron de clifford of skiptoncraven who was blamed for the execution of edwards brother edmund earl of rutland after the battle of wakefield edward ivedit harlech castle gwynedd wales the official coronation of edward iv took place in june  in london where he received a rapturous welcome from his supporters after the battle of towton henry vi and margaret had fled to scotland where they stayed with the court of james iii and followed through on their promise to cede berwick to scotland later in the year they mounted an attack on carlisle but lacking money they were easily repulsed by edwards men who were rooting out the remaining lancastrian forces in the northern counties several castles under lancastrian commanders held out for years dunstanburgh alnwick the percy family seat and bamburgh were some of the last to fall there was also some fighting in ireland at the battle of piltown in  the yorkish supporter thomas fitzgerald th earl of desmond defeated the lancastrian butlers of kilkenny the butlers suffered more than  casualties local folklore claims that the battle was so violent that the local river ran red with blood hence the names pill river and piltown baile an phuill meaning town of the blood there were lancastrian revolts in the north of england in  several lancastrian nobles including the third duke of somerset who had apparently been reconciled to edward readily led the rebellion the revolt was put down by warwicks brother john neville a small lancastrian army was destroyed at the battle of hedgeley moor on  april but because neville was escorting scottish commissioners for a treaty to york he could not immediately follow up this victory then on  may he routed somersets army at the battle of hexham somerset was captured and executed the deposed king henry was later captured for the third time at clitheroe in lancashire in  he was taken to london and held prisoner at the tower of london where for the time being he was reasonably well treated about the same time once england under edward iv and scotland had come to terms margaret and her son were forced to leave scotland and sail to france where they maintained an impoverished court in exile for several years the last remaining lancastrian stronghold was harlech castle in wales which surrendered in  after a sevenyearlong siege warwicks rebellion and the death of henry viedit middleham castle the powerful earl of warwick the kingmaker had meanwhile become the greatest landowner in england already a great magnate through his wifes property he had also inherited his fathers estates and had been granted much forfeited lancastrian property he also held many of the offices of state he was convinced of the need for an alliance with france and had been negotiating a match between edward and a french bride however edward had married elizabeth woodville the widow of a lancastrian knight in secret in  he later announced the news of his marriage as fait accompli to warwicks considerable embarrassment this embarrassment turned to bitterness when the woodvilles came to be favoured over the nevilles at court many of queen elizabeths relatives were married into noble families and others were granted peerages or royal offices other factors compounded warwicks disillusionment edwards preference for an alliance with burgundy rather than france and reluctance to allow his brothers george duke of clarence and richard duke of gloucester to marry warwicks daughters isabel and anne furthermore edwards general popularity was on the wane in this period with higher taxes and persistent disruptions of law and order louis xi of france by  warwick had formed an alliance with edwards jealous and treacherous brother george who married isabel neville in defiance of edwards wishes in calais they raised an army that defeated the kings forces at the battle of edgecote moor edward was captured at olney buckinghamshire and imprisoned at middleham castle in yorkshire warwick briefly had two kings of england in his custody warwick had the queens father richard woodville st earl rivers and her brother john executed however he made no immediate move to have edward declared illegitimate and place george on the throne the country was in turmoil with nobles once again settling scores with private armies in episodes such as the battle of nibley green and lancastrians being encouraged to rebel few of the nobles were prepared to support warwicks seizure of power edward was escorted to london by warwicks brother george neville the archbishop of york where he and warwick were reconciled to outward appearances when further rebellions broke out in lincolnshire edward easily suppressed them at the battle of losecoat field from the testimony of the captured leaders he declared that warwick and george duke of clarence had instigated them they were declared traitors and forced to flee to france where margaret of anjou was already in exile louis xi of france who wished to forestall a hostile alliance between edward and edwards brotherinlaw charles the bold duke of burgundy suggested the idea of an alliance between warwick and margaret neither of those two formerly mortal enemies entertained the notion at first but eventually they were brought round to realise the potential benefits however both were undoubtedly hoping for different outcomes warwick for a puppet king in the form of henry vi or his young son margaret to be able to reclaim her familys realm in any case a marriage was arranged between warwicks daughter anne and margarets son edward of westminster and warwick invaded england in the autumn of  battle of tewkesbury edward iv had already marched north to suppress another uprising in yorkshire warwick with help from a fleet under his nephew the bastard of fauconberg landed at dartmouth and rapidly secured support from the southern counties and ports he occupied london in october and paraded henry vi through the streets as the restored king warwicks brother john neville who had recently received the empty title marquess of montagu and who led large armies in the scottish marches suddenly defected to warwick edward was unprepared for this event and had to order his army to scatter he and richard duke of gloucester fled from doncaster to the coast and thence to holland and exile in burgundy they were proclaimed traitors and many exiled lancastrians returned to reclaim their estates warwicks success was shortlived however he overreached himself with his plan to invade burgundy in alliance with the king of france tempted by king louis promise of territory in the netherlands as a reward this led edwards brotherinlaw charles of burgundy to provide funds and troops to edward to enable him to launch an invasion of england in  edward landed with a small force at ravenspur on the yorkshire coast initially claiming to support henry and to be seeking only to have his title of duke of york restored he soon gained the city of york and rallied several supporters his brother george turned traitor again abandoning warwick having outmaneuvered warwick and montagu edward captured london his army then met warwicks at the battle of barnet the battle was fought in thick fog and some of warwicks men attacked each other by mistake it was believed by all that they had been betrayed and warwicks army fled warwick was cut down trying to reach his horse montagu was also killed in the battle margaret and her son edward had landed in the west country only a few days before the battle of barnet rather than return to france margaret sought to join the lancastrian supporters in wales and marched to cross the severn but was thwarted when the city of gloucester refused her passage across the river her army commanded by the fourth successive duke of somerset was brought to battle and destroyed at the battle of tewkesbury her son prince edward the lancastrian heir to the throne was killed with no heirs to succeed him henry vi was murdered shortly afterwards on  may  to strengthen the yorkist hold on the throne richard iiiedit richard iii the restoration of edward iv in  is sometimes seen as marking the end of the wars of the roses proper peace was restored for the remainder of edwards reign his youngest brother richard duke of gloucester and edwards lifelong companion and supporter william hastings were generously rewarded for their loyalty becoming effectively governors of the north and midlands respectively george of clarence became increasingly estranged from edward and was executed in  for association with convicted traitors when edward died suddenly in  political and dynastic turmoil erupted again many of the nobles still resented the influence of the queens woodville relatives her brother anthony woodville nd earl rivers and her son by her first marriage thomas grey st marquess of dorset and regarded them as powerhungry upstarts parvenus at the time of edwards premature death his heir edward v was only  years old and had been brought up under the stewardship of earl rivers at ludlow castle on his deathbed edward had named his surviving brother richard of gloucester as protector of england richard had been in the north when edward died hastings who also held the office of lord chamberlain sent word to him to bring a strong force to london to counter any force the woodvilles might muster the duke of buckingham also declared his support for richard richard and buckingham overtook earl rivers who was escorting the young edward v to london at stony stratford in buckinghamshire on  april although they dined with rivers amicably they took him prisoner the next day and declared to edward that they had done so to forestall a conspiracy by the woodvilles against his life rivers and his nephew richard grey were sent to pontefract castle in yorkshire and executed there at the end of june princes in the tower painted by john everett millais edward entered london in the custody of richard on  may and was lodged in the tower of london elizabeth woodville had already gone hastily into sanctuary at westminster with her remaining children although preparations were being made for edward v to be crowned on  june at which point richards authority as protector would end on  june richard held a full meeting of the council at which he accused hastings and others of conspiracy against him hastings was executed without trial later in the day thomas bourchier the archbishop of canterbury then persuaded elizabeth woodville to allow her younger son the yearold richard duke of york to join edward in the tower having secured the boys robert stillington bishop of bath and wells then alleged that edward ivs marriage to elizabeth woodville had been illegal and that the two boys were therefore illegitimate parliament agreed and enacted the titulus regius which officially named gloucester as king richard iii the two imprisoned boys known as the princes in the tower disappeared and were possibly murdered by whom and under whose orders remains controversial there was never a trial or judicial inquest on the matter perkin warbeck claimed he was the younger of the princes from  and was recognised as such in international diplomacy outside england having been crowned in a lavish ceremony on  july richard then proceeded on a tour of the midlands and the north of england dispensing generous bounties and charters and naming his own son as the prince of wales buckinghams revoltedit for more details on this topic see buckinghams rebellion opposition to richards rule had already begun in the south when on  october the duke of buckingham who had been instrumental in placing richard on the throne and who himself had a distant claim to the crown led a revolt aimed at installing the lancastrian henry tudor it has been argued that his supporting tudor rather than either edward v or his younger brother showed buckingham was aware that both were already dead the lancastrian claim to the throne had descended to henry tudor on the death of henry vi and his son in  henrys father edmund tudor st earl of richmond had been a halfbrother of henry vi but henrys claim to royalty was through his mother margaret beaufort she was descended from john beaufort who was a son of john of gaunt and thus a grandson of edward iii john beaufort had been illegitimate at birth though later legitimised by the marriage of his parents it had supposedly been a condition of the legitimation that the beaufort descendants forfeited their rights to the crown henry had spent much of his childhood under siege in harlech castle or in exile in brittany after  edward iv had preferred to belittle henrys pretensions to the crown and made only sporadic attempts to secure him however his mother margaret beaufort had been twice remarried first to buckinghams uncle and then to thomas lord stanley one of edwards principal officers and continually promoted her sons rights buckinghams rebellion failed some of his supporters in the south rose up prematurely thus allowing richards lieutenant in the south the duke of norfolk to prevent many rebels from joining forces buckingham himself raised a force at brecon in midwales he was prevented from crossing the river severn to join other rebels in the south of england by storms and floods which also prevented henry tudor landing in the west country buckinghams starving forces deserted and he was betrayed and executed the failure of buckinghams revolt was clearly not the end of the plots against richard who could never again feel secure and who also suffered the loss of his wife and elevenyearold son putting the future of the yorkist dynasty in doubt henry viiedit henry vii many of buckinghams defeated supporters and other disaffected nobles fled to join henry tudor in exile richard made an attempt to bribe the duke of brittanys chief minister pierre landais to betray henry but henry was warned and escaped to france where he was again given sanctuary and aid confident that many magnates and even many of richards officers would join him henry set sail from harfleur on  august  with a force of exiles and french mercenaries with fair winds he landed in pembrokeshire six days later the officers richard had appointed in wales either joined henry or stood aside henry gathered supporters on his march through wales and the welsh marches and defeated richard at the battle of bosworth field richard was slain during the battle supposedly by the major welsh landowner rhys ap thomas with a blow to the head from his poleaxe rhys was knighted three days later by henry vii henry having been acclaimed king henry vii then strengthened his position by marrying elizabeth of york daughter of edward iv and the best surviving yorkist claimant he thus reunited the two royal houses merging the rival symbols of the red rose of lancaster and the white rose of york into the new emblem of the red and white tudor rose henry shored up his position by executing all other possible claimants whenever any excuse was offered a policy his son henry viii continued many historians consider the accession of henry vii to mark the end of the wars of the roses others argue that they continued to the end of the fifteenth century as there were several plots to overthrow henry and restore yorkist claimants only two years after the battle of bosworth yorkists rebelled led by john de la pole earl of lincoln who had been named by richard iii as his heir but had been reconciled with henry after bosworth the conspirators produced a pretender to the throne a boy named lambert simnel who bore a close physical resemblance to the young edward earl of warwick son of george of clarence the best surviving male claimant of the house of york this plan was on very shaky ground because the young earl was still alive and in king henrys custody and was paraded through london to expose the impersonation at the battle of stoke field henry defeated lincolns army lincoln died in the battle simnel was pardoned for his part in the rebellion and was sent to work in the royal kitchens henrys throne was again challenged in  with the appearance of the pretender perkin warbeck who claimed he was richard duke of york the younger of the two princes in the tower warbeck made repeated attempts to incite revolts with support at various times from the court of burgundy and james iv of scotland he was captured after the failed second cornish uprising of  and executed in  after attempting to escape from prison during the reign of henry viis son henry viii the possibility of yorkist challenges to the throne remained until as late as  in the persons of edward stafford rd duke of buckingham edmund de la pole rd duke of suffolk and his brother richard de la pole all of whom had blood ties to the yorkist dynasty but were excluded by the prowoodville tudor settlement to an extent englands break with rome was prompted by henrys fears of a disputed succession should he leave only a female heir to the throne or an infant who would be as vulnerable as henry vi had been to antagonistic or rapacious regents aftermathedit historians debate the extent of impact the wars had on medieval english life the classical view is that the many casualties among the nobility continued the changes in feudal english society caused by the effects of the black death these included a weakening of the feudal power of the nobles and an increase in the power of the merchant classes and the growth of a centralised monarchy under the tudors the wars heralded the end of the medieval period in england and the movement towards the renaissance after the wars the large standing baronial armies that had helped fuel the conflict were suppressed henry vii wary of any further fighting kept the barons on a very tight leash removing their right to raise arm and supply armies of retainers so that they could not make war on each other or the king the military power of individual barons declined and the tudor court became a place where baronial squabbles were decided with the influence of the monarch revisionists such as the oxford historian k b mcfarlane suggest that the effects of the conflicts have been greatly exaggerated and that there were no wars of the roses many places were unaffected by the wars particularly in the eastern part of england such as east anglia it has also been suggested that the traumatic impact of the wars was exaggerated by henry vii to magnify his achievement in quelling them and bringing peace the effect of the wars on the merchant and labouring classes was far less than in the long drawnout wars of siege and pillage in europe which were carried out by mercenaries who profited from long wars although there were some lengthy sieges such as those of harlech castle and bamburgh castle these were in comparatively remote and less populous regions in the populated areas both factions had much to lose by the ruin of the country and sought quick resolution of the conflict by pitched battle philippe de commines observed in  the realm of england enjoys one favour above all other realms that neither the countryside nor the people are destroyed nor are buildings burnt or demolished misfortune falls on soldiers and nobles in particular exceptions to this claimed general rule were the lancastrian looting of ludlow after the largely bloodless yorkist defeat at ludford bridge in  and the widespread pillaging carried out by queen margarets unpaid army as it advanced south in early  both events inspired widespread opposition to the queen and support for the yorkists many areas did little or nothing to change their city defences perhaps an indication that they were left untouched by the wars city walls were either left in their ruinous state or only partially rebuilt in the case of london the city was able to avoid being devastated by convincing the york and lancaster armies to stay out after the inability to recreate the defensive city walls few noble houses were extinguished during the wars in the period from  to  before the outbreak of the wars there were as many extinctions of noble lines from natural causes  as occurred during the fighting  from  to  the most ambitious nobles died and by the later period of the wars fewer nobles were prepared to risk their lives and titles in an uncertain strugglecitation needed the kings of france and scotland and the dukes of burgundy played the two factions off against each other pledging military and financial aid and offering asylum to defeated nobles and pretenders to prevent a strong and unified england from making war on them

unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message following defeat in the hundred years war english landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings this is often considered a contributory cause of the wars of the roses the wars were fought largely by the landed aristocracy and armies of feudal retainers with some mercenaries at the end of the hundred years war large numbers of unemployed soldiery returned to england seeking employment in the growing armies of local nobility england drifted toward misrule and violence under the weak governance as local noble families like the nevilles and percies increasingly relied on their feudal retainers to settle disputes it became common practice for landowners to bind their mesnie knights to their service with annual payments half of an indenture contract the randomly cut or indented edge proves a match to the counterpart document edward iii had developed the contract system where the monarch entered into formal written contracts called indenture with experienced captains who were contractually obligated to provide an agreed upon number of men at established rates for a given period frequently the landed nobility acted the principal or main contractor knights men at arms and archers were often subcontracted in addition to professional retainers a lord could find men amongst his tenantry these included landless men and others who would crave the security of maintenance and livery skilled archers could command as high a wage as knights as baronial armies grew in size the rule of law was weakened support for each house largely depended upon dynastic factors such as blood relationships marriages within the nobility and the grants or confiscations of feudal titles and lands given the conflicting loyalties of blood marriage and ambition it was not uncommon for nobles to switch sides several battles such as northampton and bosworth were decided by treacherycitation needed the armies consisted of nobles contingents of menatarms with companies of archers and footsoldiers such as billmen there were also sometimes contingents of foreign mercenaries armed with cannon or handguns the horsemen were generally restricted to prickers and scourers ie scouting and foraging parties the rules of military engagement changed as civil war succeeded overseas campaigns it was customary for the heavy cavalry to fight entirely on foot in several cases noblemen dismounted and fought among the common footsoldiers to inspire them and to dispel the notion that in the case of defeat they might be ransomed while the common soldiers being of little value faced death it was often claimed however that the nobles faced greater risks than the ordinary soldiers as there was little incentive for anyone to take prisoner any highranking noble during or immediately after a battle during the hundred years war against france a captured noble would be able to ransom himself for a large sum but in the wars of the roses a captured noble who belonged to a defeated faction had a high chance of being executed as a traitor for example fortytwo captured knights were executed after the battle of towton the burgundian observer philippe de commines who met edward iv in  reported king edward told me in all the battles which he had won as soon as he had gained victory he mounted his horse and shouted to his men that they must spare the common soldiers and kill the lords of whom none or few escaped even those who escaped execution might be declared attainted and therefore possessing no property and of no value to a captorref chronological list of battlesedit first battle of st albans

based on these descents that they claimed the english crown compared with the house of lancaster it had a senior claim to the throne of england according to cognatic primogeniture but junior claim according to the agnatic primogeniture the reign of this dynasty ended with the death of richard iii of england in  it became extinct in the male line with the death of edward plantagenet th earl of

cambridge kg  june  –  august  was a younger son of king edward iii of england and philippa of hainault the fourth of their five sons who lived to adulthood he was the founder of the house of york but it was through the marriage of his younger son richard to anne mortimer that the yorkist faction in the wars of the roses made its claim on the throne the other party in the wars of the roses the lancasters were descendants of edmunds elder brother john of gaunt whose son henry usurped the throne of richard ii in  edmund had two sons edward and richard of conisburgh edward succeeded to the dukedom in  but was killed at the battle of agincourt in  with no issue richard married anne mortimer a greatgranddaughter of lionel of antwerp the second son cadet line of edward iii furthermore annes son richard also became heir general to the earldom of march after her only brother edmund th earl died without issue in  their father roger mortimer th earl of march had been named heir presumptive of richard ii before henry ivs accession although it had been passed over at the time annes son richard also inherited this claim to the throne richard of conisburgh was executed following his involvement in the southampton plot to depose henry v of england in favour of the earl of march the dukedom of york therefore passed to his son richard plantagenet through his mother richard plantagenet also inherited the lands of the earldom of march as well as the mortimer claim to the throne key house of york edward iii king of england – lionel st duke of clarence – philippa th

main article wars of the roses despite his elevated status richard plantagenet was denied a position in government by the advisers of the weak henry vi particularly john beaufort st duke of somerset and the queen consort margaret of anjou although he served as protector of the realm during henry vis period of incapacity in  his reforms were reversed by somersets party once the king had recovered the wars of the roses began the following year with the first battle of st albans initially richard aimed only to purge his lancastrian political opponents from positions of influence over the king it was not until october  that he claimed the throne for the house of york in that year the yorkists had captured the king at the battle of northampton but victory was shortlived richard and his second son edmund were killed at the battle of wakefield on  december richards claim to the throne was inherited by his son edward with the support of richard neville th earl of warwick the kingmaker edward already showing great promise as a leader of men defeated the lancastrians in a succession of battles while henry vi and margaret of anjou were campaigning in the north warwick gained control of the capital and had edward declared king in london in  edward strengthened his claim with a decisive victory at the battle of towton in the same year in the course of which the lancastrian army was virtually wiped out reigns of the yorkist kingsedit the early reign of edward iv was marred by lancastrian plotting and uprisings in favour of henry vi warwick himself changed sides and supported margaret of anjou and the kings jealous brother george duke of clarence in briefly restoring henry in  however edward regained his throne and the house of lancaster was wiped out with the death of henry vi himself in the tower of london in  in  the continued trouble caused by clarence led to his execution in the tower of london popularly he is thought to have been drowned in a butt of malmsey wine on edwards death in  the crown passed to his twelveyearold son edward edward ivs younger brother richard duke of gloucester was appointed protector and escorted the young king and his brother richard to the tower of london the famous princes in the tower were never seen again however it is unknown whether they were killed or who killed them if it happened parliament declared in the document titulus regius that the two boys were illegitimate on the grounds that edward ivs marriage was invalid and as such richard was heir to the throne he was crowned richard iii in july  defeat of the house of yorkedit richard iii had many enemies though the house of lancaster had been extinguished the lancastrian sympathisers survived who now rallied behind henry tudor a descendant of the beauforts a legitimized branch of the house of lancaster moreover the family of edward iv and the edwardian loyalists were naturally opposed to him essentially dividing his yorkist power base a coup attempt failed in late  but in  richard met henry tudor at the battle of bosworth field during the battle some of richards important supporters switched sides or withheld their retainers from the field richard himself was killed he was the last of the plantagenet kings as well as the last english king to die in battle henry tudor declared himself king took elizabeth of york eldest child of edward iv as his wife symbolically uniting the surviving houses of york and lancaster and acceded to the throne as henry vii founder of the tudor dynasty which reigned until  later claimantsedit see also alternative successions of the english crown the de la pole family were sometimes suggested as heirs to the yorkist cause but henry tudor and his son henry viii of england efficiently suppressed all such opposition another yorkist branch descends from george plantagenet st duke of clarence and younger brother of edward iv the heir to this branch is the earl of loudoun currently simon abneyhastings there was in edward ivs reign a suspicion that this king was illegitimate in  the british station channel  revived the george branchs claim as britains real monarch the earls of loudoun would then at least be the heirs to the yorkists legacyedit upon henry tudors uniting the rival houses of lancaster and york the title duke of york became a royal prerogative and is traditionally accorded to the second son of the reigning monarch beginning with richard of shrewsbury son of edward iv one of the princes in the tower none of its holders were able to transmit it they either died without a male heir or succeeded to the throne the title is held today by prince andrew second son of queen elizabeth ii and her consort prince philip duke of edinburgh the symbol of the house of york was a white rose still used as the badge of yorkshire and jacobitism york pennsylvania is known as the white rose city after the symbol of the house of york the rivalry between york and lancaster in

see also royal badges of england the most popular symbol of the house of york was the white rose of york the yorkist rose is white in colour because in christian liturgical symbolism white is the symbol of light typifying innocence and purity joy and glory during the civil wars of the fifteenth century the white rose was the symbol of yorkist forces opposed to the rival house of lancaster the red rose of lancaster would be a later invention used to represent the house of lancaster but was not in use during the actual conflict the opposition of the two roses gave the wars their name the

surviving son it is based on these descents that they claimed the english crown compared with the house of lancaster it had a senior claim to the throne of england according to cognatic primogeniture

york st earl of cambridge kg  june  –  august  was a younger son of king edward iii of england and philippa of hainault the fourth of their five sons who lived to adulthood he was the founder of the house of york but it was through the marriage of his younger son richard to anne mortimer that the yorkist faction in the wars of the roses made its claim on the throne the other party in the wars of the roses the lancasters were descendants of edmunds elder brother john of gaunt whose son henry usurped the throne of richard ii in  edmund had two sons edward and richard of conisburgh edward succeeded to the dukedom in  but was killed at the battle of agincourt in  with no issue richard married anne mortimer a greatgranddaughter of lionel of antwerp the second son cadet line of edward iii furthermore annes son richard also became heir general to the earldom of march after her only brother edmund th earl died without issue in  their father roger mortimer th earl of march had been named heir presumptive of richard ii before henry ivs accession although it had been passed over at the time annes son richard also inherited this claim to the throne richard of conisburgh was executed following his involvement in the southampton plot to depose henry v of england in favour of the earl of march the dukedom of york therefore passed to his son richard plantagenet through his mother

main article wars of the roses despite his elevated status richard plantagenet was denied a position in government by the advisers of the weak henry vi particularly john beaufort st duke of somerset and the queen consort margaret of anjou although he served as protector of the realm during henry vis period of incapacity in  his reforms were reversed by somersets party once the king had recovered the wars of the roses began the following year with the first battle of st albans initially richard aimed only to purge his lancastrian political opponents from positions of influence over the king it was not until october  that he claimed the throne for the house of york in that year the yorkists had captured the king at the battle of northampton but victory was shortlived richard and his second son edmund were killed at the battle of wakefield on  december richards claim to the throne was inherited by his son edward with the support of richard neville th earl of warwick the kingmaker edward already showing great promise as a leader of men defeated the lancastrians in a succession of battles while henry vi and margaret of anjou were campaigning in the north warwick gained control of the capital and had edward declared king in london in  edward strengthened his claim with a decisive victory at the battle of towton in the same year in the course of which the lancastrian army was virtually wiped out reigns of the yorkist kingsedit the early reign of edward iv was marred by lancastrian plotting and uprisings in favour of henry vi warwick himself changed sides and supported margaret of anjou and the kings jealous brother george duke of clarence in briefly restoring henry in  however edward regained his throne and the house of lancaster was wiped out with the death of henry vi himself in the tower of london in  in  the continued trouble caused by clarence led to his execution in the tower of london popularly he is thought to have been drowned in a butt of malmsey wine on edwards death in  the crown passed to his twelveyearold son edward edward ivs younger brother richard duke of gloucester was appointed protector and escorted the young king and his brother richard to the tower of london the famous princes in the tower were never seen again however it is unknown whether they were killed or who killed them if it happened parliament declared in the document titulus regius that the two boys were illegitimate on the grounds that edward ivs marriage was invalid and as such richard was heir to the throne he was crowned richard iii in july  defeat of the house of yorkedit richard iii had many enemies though the house of lancaster had been extinguished the lancastrian sympathisers survived who now rallied behind henry tudor a descendant of the beauforts a legitimized branch of the house of lancaster moreover the family of edward iv and the edwardian loyalists were naturally opposed to him essentially dividing his yorkist power base a coup attempt failed in late  but in  richard met henry tudor at the battle of bosworth field during the battle some of richards important supporters switched sides or withheld their retainers from the field richard himself was killed he was the last of the plantagenet kings as well as the last english king to die in battle henry tudor declared himself king took elizabeth of york eldest child of edward iv as his wife symbolically uniting the surviving houses of york and lancaster and acceded to the throne as henry vii founder of the tudor dynasty which reigned until  later claimantsedit see also alternative successions of the english crown the de la pole family were sometimes suggested as heirs to the yorkist cause but henry tudor and his son henry viii of england efficiently suppressed all such opposition another yorkist branch descends from george plantagenet st duke of clarence and younger brother of edward iv the heir to this branch is the earl of loudoun currently simon abneyhastings there was in edward ivs reign a suspicion that this king was illegitimate in  the british station channel  revived the george branchs claim as britains real monarch the earls of loudoun would then at least be the heirs to the yorkists legacyedit upon henry tudors uniting the rival houses of lancaster and york the title duke of york became a royal prerogative and is traditionally accorded to the second son of the reigning monarch beginning with richard of shrewsbury son of edward iv one of the princes in the tower none of its holders were able to transmit it they either died without a male heir or succeeded to the throne the title is held today by prince andrew second son of queen elizabeth ii and her consort prince philip duke of edinburgh the symbol of the house of york was a white rose still used as the badge of yorkshire and jacobitism york pennsylvania is known as the white rose city after the symbol of the house of york the rivalry between york and lancaster in

see also royal badges of england the most popular symbol of the house of york was the white rose of york the yorkist rose is white in colour because in christian liturgical symbolism white is the symbol of light typifying innocence and purity joy and glory during the civil wars of the fifteenth century the white rose was the symbol of yorkist forces opposed to the rival house of lancaster the red rose of lancaster would be a later invention used to represent the house of lancaster but was not in use during the actual conflict the opposition of the two roses gave the wars their name the

losecoat field barnet tewkesbury bosworth field stoke field the wars of the roses were a series of wars for control of the throne of england fought between supporters of two rival branches of the royal house of plantagenet the house of lancaster associated with a red rose and the house of york whose symbol was a white rose the conflict lasted through many sporadic episodes between  and  however there was fighting before and after this period between the houses the power struggle ignited around social and financial troubles following the hundred years war combined with the mental infirmity and weak rule of henry vi which revived interest in richard of yorks claim to the throne historians disagree about whether the wars of the roses were caused by the structural problems of bastard feudalism or henry vis ineffectiveness as king with the duke of yorks death the claim transferred to his heir edward who later became the first yorkist king of england as edward iv his son reigned for  days as edward v but parliament then decided that edward and his brother richard were illegitimate and offered the crown to edward ivs younger brother who became richard iii the two young princes disappeared within the confines of the tower of london the final victory went to a claimant of the lancastrian party henry tudor earl of richmond who defeated the last yorkist king richard iii at the battle of bosworth field after assuming the throne as henry vii he married elizabeth of york the eldest daughter and heir of edward iv thereby uniting the two claims the house of tudor ruled

associated with the two royal houses the white rose of york and the red rose of lancaster wars of the roses came into common use in the nineteenth century after the publication in  of anne of geierstein by sir walter scott scott based the name on a scene in william shakespeares play henry vi part  set in the gardens of the temple church where a number of noblemen and a lawyer pick red or white roses to show their loyalty to the lancastrian or yorkist faction respectively the yorkist faction used the symbol of the white rose from early in the conflict but the lancastrian red rose was apparently introduced only after the victory of henry tudor at the battle of bosworth when it was combined with the yorkist white rose to form the tudor rose which symbolised the union of the two houses the origins of the rose as a cognizance itself stem from edward is use of a golden rose stalked proper often owing to nobles holding multiple titles more than one badge was used edward iv for example used both his sun in splendour as earl of march but also his fathers falcon and fetterlock as duke of york badges were not always distinct at the battle of barnet edwards sun was very similar to the earl of oxfords vere star which caused fateful confusion most but not all of the participants in the wars wore livery badges associated with their immediate lords or patrons under the prevailing system of bastard feudalism the wearing of livery was by now confined to those in continuous employ of a lord thus excluding for example mercenaries another example henry tudors forces at bosworth fought under the banner of a red dragon while the yorkist army used richard iiis personal device of a white boar although the names of the rival houses derive from the cities of york and lancaster the corresponding duchies had little to do with these cities the lands and offices attached to the duchy of lancaster were mainly in gloucestershire north wales and cheshire while the estates and castles that were part of the duchy of york were spread throughout england and wales although many were in the welsh marches summary of eventsedit this section does not cite any sources

in the wars of the roses although minor armed clashes had occurred previously between supporters of york and lancaster the first open fighting broke out in  at the first battle of st albans several prominent lancastrians died at the hands of the yorkists although peace was temporarily restored the lancastrians were inspired by margaret of anjou to contest yorks influence and a deadly feud between the two branches of the royal family ensued fighting resumed more violently in  york and his supporters were forced to flee the country but one of his most prominent supporters the earl of warwick invaded england from calais and captured henry vi at the battle of northampton york returned to the country and became protector of england but was dissuaded from claiming the throne margaret and the remaining lancastrian nobles gathered their army in the north of england when york moved north to engage them he and his second son edmund were killed at the battle of wakefield in december  the lancastrian army advanced south and released henry at the second battle of st albans but failed to occupy london and subsequently retreated to the north yorks eldest son edward earl of march was proclaimed king edward iv he gathered the yorkist armies and won a crushing victory at the battle of towton in march  after lancastrian revolts in the north were suppressed in  and henry was captured once again and placed in the tower of london edward fell out with his chief supporter and adviser the earl of warwick known as the kingmaker after edwards unpopular and secretly conducted marriage with the widow of a lancastrian supporter elizabeth woodville within a few years it became clear that edward was favoring his wifes family and alienating a number of friends closely aligned with warwick as well a nearcontemporary flemish picture of the battle of barnet in  furious warwick tried first to supplant edward with his younger brother george duke of clarence establishing the alliance by marriage to his daughter isabel neville when that plan failed due to lack of support from parliament warwick sailed to france with his family and made an alliance with the lancastrian queen margaret of anjou to restore henry vi to the throne this resulted in two years of rapid changes of fortune before edward iv once again won complete victories at barnet april  where warwick was killed and tewkesbury may  where the lancastrian heir edward of westminster prince of wales was killed or perhaps executed after the battle queen margaret was escorted to london as a prisoner and henry was murdered in the tower of london several days later ending the direct lancastrian line of succession a period of comparative peace followed ending with the unexpected death of king edward in  his surviving brother richard duke of gloucester first moved to prevent the unpopular woodville family of edwards widow from participating in the government during the minority of edwards son edward v and then seized the throne for himself using the suspect legitimacy of edward ivs marriage as pretext henry tudor a distant relative of the lancastrian kings who had inherited their claim defeated richard iii at bosworth in  he was crowned henry vii and married elizabeth of york daughter of edward iv to unite and reconcile the two houses yorkist revolts directed by john de la pole st earl of lincoln and others flared up in  under the banner of the pretender lambert simnel—who claimed he was edward earl of warwick son of george of clarence resulting in the last pitched battles though most surviving descendants of richard of york were imprisoned sporadic rebellions continued until  when perkin warbeck who claimed he was the younger brother of edward v one of the two disappeared princes in the tower was imprisoned and later executed origins of the conflictedit disputed successionedit william the conquerors son king henry i of england died in  after his only male heir was killed aboard the white ship following the white ship disaster england entered a period of prolonged instability known as the anarchy however following the ascension of henry ii plantagenet to the throne in  the crown passed from father to son or brother to brother with little difficulty until  henry iv the question of succession after edward iiis death in  is said to be the cause of the wars of roses although edward iii had five legitimate sons there was a sudden narrowing in the direct line of descent near the end of his reign edwards eldest son edward the black prince had died the year before the black princes own eldest son edward of angoulême had died in  edward iii was succeeded on the throne by the black princes younger son richard ii who was only  years old richards claim to the throne was based on the principle that the son of an elder brother had priority in the succession over his uncles since richard was a minor and had three living uncles at the time of edward iiis death there was considerable uncertainty about who was next in line for the succession by custom roger mortimer who claimed descent from king edward through his mother philippa of clarence edward iiis eldest grandchild had the best claim to succeed however a legal decree issued by edward iii in  had introduced some complexity into the question of who would ultimately take the throne the letters patent issued by edward iii limited the right of succession to male heirs which placed richards uncle john of gaunt duke of lancaster and his male descendants ahead of philippas male children in the succession richard iis reign was marked by increasing dissension between the king and several of the most powerful nobles in  he exiled gaunts son henry of bolingbroke richards government had become highly unpopular beyond his strongholds in cheshire and wales and when bolingbroke returned from exile in  initially to reclaim his rights as duke of lancaster he took advantage of the support of most of the nobles to depose richard and was crowned king henry iv establishing the house of lancaster on the throne house of lancasteredit henry v henry ivs claim to the throne was through his father john of gaunt third surviving son of edward iii the childless richard ii had nominated edmund mortimer th earl of march as his successor but there was little support at the time for the counterclaim of the young mortimer as henrys initial popularity waned the mortimer familys claim to the throne was a pretext for the major rebellion of owain glyndŵr in wales and other less successful revolts in cheshire and northumberland there were uprisings in support of the mortimers claim throughout henry ivs reign which lasted until  an important branch of the house of lancaster were the beauforts who were descended from gaunt by his mistress katherine swynford when gaunt and katherine later married their descendants were made legitimate by an act of parliament however henry iv excluded them from the line of succession to the throne henry ivs son and successor henry v inherited a temporarily pacified nation and his military success against france in the hundred years war bolstered his popularity enabling him to strengthen the lancastrian hold on the throne nevertheless one notable conspiracy against henry the southampton plot took place during his nineyear reign this was led by richard earl of cambridge who was executed for treason in  at the start of the campaign that led to the battle of agincourt house of yorkedit the founder of the house of york was edmund of langley the fourth son of edward iii and the younger brother of john of gaunt his son richard earl of cambridge had married anne de mortimer the mortimers were members of the most powerful marcher family of the fourteenth century gm trevelyan has written that the wars of the roses were to a large extent a quarrel between welsh marcer lords who were also great english nobles closely related to the english throne anne herself was descended from edward iii through her mother philippa of clarence daughter of lionel of antwerp edwards second son anne mortimers husband richard earl of cambridge anne had died in  when her brother edmund earl of march who had loyally supported henry died childless in  the title and extensive estates of the earldom of march and the mortimer claim to the throne thus passed to annes descendants richard of york the son of cambridge and anne mortimer was four years old at the time of his fathers execution although cambridge was attainted henry v later allowed richard to inherit the title and lands of cambridges elder brother edward duke of york who had died fighting alongside henry at agincourt and had no issue henry who had three younger brothers and was himself in his prime and recently married to the french princess catherine of valois had no doubt that the lancastrian right to the crown was secure henrys premature death in  at the age of  led to his only son henry vi coming to the throne as an infant and the country being ruled by regents henry vs younger brothers produced no surviving legitimate issue leaving only distant cousins the beauforts as alternative lancaster heirs as richard of york grew into maturity and questions were raised over henry vis fitness to rule richards claim to the throne thus became more significant the revenue from the york and march estates also made him the wealthiest magnate in the land henry viedit from early childhood henry vi was surrounded by quarrelsome councillors and advisors his younger surviving paternal uncle humphrey duke of gloucester sought to be named protector and deliberately courted the popularity of the common people for his own ends but was opposed by cardinal beaufort on several occasions beaufort called on john duke of bedford humphreys older brother to return from his post as regent in france either to mediate or to defend him against humphreys accusations of treason some time after bedford died in  cardinal beaufort withdrew from public affairs partly due to old age and partly because william de la pole st duke of suffolk rose to become the dominant personality at court suffolk was widely held to be enriching himself through his influence on henry and was blamed for mismanaging the government and poorly executing the continuing hundred years war with france under henry vi all the land in france won by henry v and even the provinces of guienne and gascony which had been held since the reign of henry ii three centuries previously were lost henry vi suffolk eventually succeeded in having humphrey of gloucester arrested for treason humphrey died while awaiting trial in prison at bury st edmunds in  some authorities date the start of the war of the roses from the death of humphrey however with severe reverses in france suffolk was stripped of office and was murdered on his way to exile edmund beaufort nd duke of somerset succeeded him as leader of the party seeking peace with france the duke of york who had succeeded bedford as lieutenant in france meanwhile represented those who wished to prosecute the war more vigorously and criticised the court and somerset in particular for starving him of funds and men during his campaigns in france in all these quarrels henry vi had taken little part he was seen as a weak ineffectual king in addition he displayed several symptoms of mental illness that he may have inherited from his maternal grandfather charles vi of france by  many considered henry incapable of carrying out the duties and responsibilities of a king in  there was a violent popular revolt in kent jack cades rebellion which is often seen as the prelude to the wars of the roses the rebel manifesto the complaint of the poor commons of kent was written under cades leadership it accused the crown of extortion perversion of justice and election fraud the rebels occupied parts of london and executed james fiennes st baron saye and sele the unpopular lord high treasurer after a hasty trial after some of them fell to looting they were driven out of london by the citizens they dispersed after they were supposedly pardoned but several including cade were later executed after the rebellion the rebels grievances formed the basis of richard of yorks opposition of a royal government from which he felt excluded two years later in  richard of york returned to england from his new post as lieutenant of ireland and marched on london demanding somersets removal and reform of the government at this stage few of the nobles supported such drastic action and york was forced to submit to superior force at blackheath he was imprisoned for much of  and  but was released after swearing not to take arms against the court the increasing discord at court was mirrored in the country as a whole where noble families engaged in private feuds and showed increasing disrespect for the royal authority and for the courts of law in many cases feuds were fought between oldestablished families and formerly minor nobility raised in power and influence by henry iv in the aftermath of the rebellions against him the quarrel between the percys—long the earls of northumberland—and the comparatively upstart nevilles was the bestknown of these private wars and followed this pattern as did the bonville–courtenay feud in cornwall and devon a factor in these feuds was the presence of large numbers of soldiers discharged from the english armies that had been defeated in france nobles engaged many of these to mount raids or to pack courts of justice with their supporters intimidating suitors witnesses and judges this growing civil discontent the abundance of feuding nobles with private armies and corruption in henry vis court formed a political climate ripe for civil war with the king so easily manipulated power rested with those closest to him at court in other words somerset and the lancastrian faction richard and the yorkist faction who tended to be physically placed further away from the seat of power found their power slowly being stripped away royal power and finances also started to slip as henry was persuaded to grant many royal lands and estates to the lancastrians thereby losing their revenue in  henry suffered the first of several bouts of complete mental collapse during which he failed even to recognise his newborn son edward of westminster on  march  cardinal john kemp the chancellor died henry was incapable of nominating a successor to ensure that the country could be governed a council of regency was set up headed by the duke of york who still remained popular with the people as lord protector york soon asserted his power with evergreater boldness although there is no proof that he had aspirations to the throne at this early stage he imprisoned somerset and backed his neville allies his brotherinlaw the earl of salisbury and salisburys son the earl of warwick in their continuing feud with the earl of northumberland a powerful supporter of henry henry recovered in  and once again fell under the influence of those closest to him at court directed by henrys queen the powerful and aggressive margaret of anjou who emerged as the de facto leader of the lancastrians richard was forced out of court margaret built up an alliance against richard and conspired with other nobles to reduce his influence an increasingly thwarted richard who feared arrest for treason finally resorted to armed hostilities in  start of the waredit the lancastrian siege of london in  is attacked by a yorkist sally richard duke of york led a small force toward london and was met by henrys forces at st albans north of london on  may  the relatively small first battle of st albans was the first open conflict of the civil war richards aim was ostensibly to remove poor advisors from king henrys side the result was a lancastrian defeat several prominent lancastrian leaders including somerset and northumberland were killed after the battle the yorkists found henry hiding in a local tanners shop abandoned by his advisers and servants apparently having suffered another bout of mental illness he had also been slightly wounded in the neck by an arrow york and his allies regained their position of influence with the king indisposed york was again appointed protector and margaret was shunted aside charged with the kings care for a while both sides seemed shocked that an actual battle had been fought and did their best to reconcile their differences but the problems that caused conflict soon reemerged particularly the issue of whether the duke of york or henry and margarets infant son edward would succeed to the throne margaret refused to accept any solution that would disinherit her son and it became clear that she would only tolerate the situation for as long as the duke of york and his allies retained the military ascendancy henry recovered and in february  he relieved york of his office of protector in the autumn of that year henry went on royal progress in the midlands where the king and queen were popular margaret did not allow him to return to london where the merchants were angry at the decline in trade and the widespread disorder the kings court was set up at coventry by then the new duke of somerset was emerging as a favourite of the royal court margaret persuaded henry to revoke the appointments york had made as protector while york was made to return to his post as lieutenant in ireland disorder in the capital and the north of england where fighting between the nevilles and percys had resumed  and piracy by french fleets on the south coast were growing but the king and queen remained intent on protecting their own positions with the queen introducing conscription for the first time in england meanwhile yorks ally warwick later dubbed the kingmaker was growing in popularity in london as the champion of the merchants as captain of calais he had fought piracy in the channel in the spring of  thomas bourchier the archbishop of canterbury attempted to arrange a reconciliation the lords had gathered in london for a grand council and the city was full of armed retainers the archbishop negotiated complex settlements to resolve the bloodfeuds that had persisted since the battle of st albans then on lady day  march the king led a love day procession to st pauls cathedral with lancastrian and yorkist nobles following him hand in hand no sooner had the procession and the council dispersed than plotting resumed act of accordedit ludlow castle south shropshire the next outbreak of fighting was prompted by warwicks highhanded actions as captain of calais he led his ships in attacks on neutral hanseatic league and spanish ships in the channel on flimsy grounds of sovereignty he was summoned to london to face enquiries but he claimed that attempts had been made on his life and returned to calais york salisbury and warwick were summoned to a royal council at coventry but they refused fearing arrest when they were isolated from their own supporters york summoned the nevilles to join him at his stronghold at ludlow castle in the welsh marches on  september  at the battle of blore heath in staffordshire a lancastrian army failed to prevent salisbury from marching from middleham castle in yorkshire to ludlow shortly afterwards the combined yorkist armies confronted the much larger lancastrian force at the battle of ludford bridge warwicks contingent from the garrison of calais under andrew trollope defected to the lancastrians and the yorkist leaders fled york returned to ireland and his eldest son edward earl of march salisbury and warwick fled to calais the lancastrians were back in total control york and his supporters were attainted at the parliament of devils as traitors somerset was appointed governor of calais and was dispatched to take over the vital fortress on the french coast but his attempts to evict warwick were easily repulsed warwick and his supporters even began to launch raids on the english coast from calais adding to the sense of chaos and disorder being attainted only by a successful invasion could the yorkists recover their lands and titles warwick travelled to ireland to concert plans with york evading the royal ships commanded by the duke of exeter in late june  warwick salisbury and edward of march crossed the channel and rapidly established themselves in kent and london where they enjoyed wide support backed by a papal emissary who had taken their side they marched north king henry led an army south to meet them while margaret remained in the north with prince edward at the battle of northampton on  july the yorkist army under warwick defeated the lancastrians aided by treachery in the kings ranks for the second time in the war king henry was found by the yorkists in a tent abandoned by his retinue having apparently suffered another breakdown with the king in their possession the yorkists returned to london in the light of this military success richard of york moved to press his claim to the throne based on the illegitimacy of the lancastrian line landing in north wales he and his wife cecily entered london with all the ceremony usually reserved for a monarch parliament was assembled and when york entered he made straight for the throne which he may have been expecting the lords to encourage him to take for himself as they had acclaimed henry iv in  instead there was stunned silence york announced his claim to the throne but the lords even warwick and salisbury were shocked by his presumption they had no desire at this stage to overthrow king henry their ambition was still limited to the removal of his councillors the next day york produced detailed genealogies to support his claim based on his descent from lionel of antwerp duke of clarence yorks claim was through a daughter of a second son henrys through the son of a third son the judges felt that common law principles could not determine who had priority in the royal succession and declared the matter above the law and passed ther lernyng parliament agreed to consider the matter and accepted that yorks claim was better but by a majority of five they voted that henry vi should remain as king a compromise was struck in october  with the act of accord which recognised york as henrys successor disinheriting henrys sixyearold son edward york accepted this compromise as the best offer it gave him much of what he wanted particularly since he was also made protector of the realm and was able to govern in henrys name death of richard duke of yorkedit ruins of sandal castle near wakefield west yorkshire queen margaret and her son had fled to north wales parts of which were still in lancastrian hands they later travelled by sea to scotland to negotiate for scottish assistance mary of gueldres queen consort to james ii of scotland agreed to give margaret an army on condition that she cede the town of berwick to scotland and marys daughter be betrothed to prince edward margaret agreed although she had no funds to pay her army and could only promise booty from the riches of southern england as long as no looting took place north of the river trent the duke of york left london later that year with the earl of salisbury to consolidate his position in the north against the lancastrians who were reported to be massing near the city of york he took up a defensive position at sandal castle near wakefield over christmas  then on  december his forces left the castle and attacked the lancastrians in the open although outnumbered the ensuing battle of wakefield was a complete lancastrian victory richard of york was slain in the battle and both salisbury and yorks yearold second son edmund earl of rutland were captured and executed margaret ordered the heads of all three placed on the gates of york edwards claim to the throneedit parhelion at sunset the act of accord and the events of wakefield left the yearold edward earl of march yorks eldest son as duke of york and heir to his claim to the throne with an army from the proyorkist marches the border area between england and wales he met jasper tudors lancastrian army arriving from wales and he defeated them soundly at the battle of mortimers cross in herefordshire he inspired his men with a vision of three suns at dawn a phenomenon known as parhelion telling them that it was a portent of victory and represented the three surviving york sons himself george and richard this led to edwards later adoption of the sign of the sunne in splendour as his personal device margarets army was moving south supporting itself by looting as it passed through the prosperous south of england in london warwick used this as propaganda to reinforce yorkist support throughout the south – the town of coventry switched allegiance to the yorkists warwicks army established fortified positions north of the town of st albans to block the main road from the north but was outmanoeuvred by margarets army which swerved to the west and then attacked warwicks positions from behind at the second battle of st albans the lancastrians won another big victory as the yorkist forces fled they left behind king henry who was found unharmed sitting quietly beneath a tree henry knighted thirty lancastrian soldiers immediately after the battle in an illustration of the increasing bitterness of the war queen margaret instructed her sevenyearold son edward of westminster to determine the manner of execution of the yorkist knights who had been charged with keeping henry safe and had stayed at his side throughout the battle as the lancastrian army advanced southwards a wave of dread swept london where rumours were rife about savage northerners intent on plundering the city the people of london shut the city gates and refused to supply food to the queens army which was looting the surrounding counties of hertfordshire and middlesex yorkist triumphedit edward iv edward of march having joined with warwicks surviving forces advanced towards london from the west at the same time that the queen retreated northwards to dunstable as a result edward and warwick were able to enter london with their army they found considerable support there as the city was largely yorkistsupporting it was clear that edward was no longer simply trying to free the king from bad councillors but that his goal was to take the crown thomas kempe the bishop of london asked the people of london their opinion and they replied with shouts of king edward the request was quickly approved by parliament and edward was unofficially crowned in an impromptu ceremony at westminster abbey edward vowed that he would not have a formal coronation until henry vi and his wife were removed from the scene edward claimed henry had forfeited his right to the crown by allowing his queen to take up arms against his rightful heirs under the act of accord parliament had already accepted that edwards victory was simply a restoration of the rightful heir to the throne edward and warwick marched north gathering a large army as they went and met an equally impressive lancastrian army at towton the battle of towton near york was the biggest battle of the wars of the roses both sides agreed beforehand that the issue would be settled that day with no quarter asked or given an estimated – men took part with over  men being killed during and after the battle an enormous number for the time and the greatest recorded single days loss of life on english soil edward and his army won a decisive victory and the lancastrians were routed with most of their leaders slain henry and margaret who were waiting in york with their son edward fled north when they heard the outcome many of the surviving lancastrian nobles switched allegiance to king edward and those who did not were driven back to the northern border areas and a few castles in wales edward advanced to take york where he replaced the rotting heads of his father his brother and salisbury with those of defeated lancastrian lords such as the notorious john clifford th baron de clifford of skiptoncraven who was blamed for the execution of edwards brother edmund earl of rutland after the battle of wakefield edward ivedit harlech castle gwynedd wales the official coronation of edward iv took place in june  in london where he received a rapturous welcome from his supporters after the battle of towton henry vi and margaret had fled to scotland where they stayed with the court of james iii and followed through on their promise to cede berwick to scotland later in the year they mounted an attack on carlisle but lacking money they were easily repulsed by edwards men who were rooting out the remaining lancastrian forces in the northern counties several castles under lancastrian commanders held out for years dunstanburgh alnwick the percy family seat and bamburgh were some of the last to fall there was also some fighting in ireland at the battle of piltown in  the yorkish supporter thomas fitzgerald th earl of desmond defeated the lancastrian butlers of kilkenny the butlers suffered more than  casualties local folklore claims that the battle was so violent that the local river ran red with blood hence the names pill river and piltown baile an phuill meaning town of the blood there were lancastrian revolts in the north of england in  several lancastrian nobles including the third duke of somerset who had apparently been reconciled to edward readily led the rebellion the revolt was put down by warwicks brother john neville a small lancastrian army was destroyed at the battle of hedgeley moor on  april but because neville was escorting scottish commissioners for a treaty to york he could not immediately follow up this victory then on  may he routed somersets army at the battle of hexham somerset was captured and executed the deposed king henry was later captured for the third time at clitheroe in lancashire in  he was taken to london and held prisoner at the tower of london where for the time being he was reasonably well treated about the same time once england under edward iv and scotland had come to terms margaret and her son were forced to leave scotland and sail to france where they maintained an impoverished court in exile for several years the last remaining lancastrian stronghold was harlech castle in wales which surrendered in  after a sevenyearlong siege warwicks rebellion and the death of henry viedit middleham castle the powerful earl of warwick the kingmaker had meanwhile become the greatest landowner in england already a great magnate through his wifes property he had also inherited his fathers estates and had been granted much forfeited lancastrian property he also held many of the offices of state he was convinced of the need for an alliance with france and had been negotiating a match between edward and a french bride however edward had married elizabeth woodville the widow of a lancastrian knight in secret in  he later announced the news of his marriage as fait accompli to warwicks considerable embarrassment this embarrassment turned to bitterness when the woodvilles came to be favoured over the nevilles at court many of queen elizabeths relatives were married into noble families and others were granted peerages or royal offices other factors compounded warwicks disillusionment edwards preference for an alliance with burgundy rather than france and reluctance to allow his brothers george duke of clarence and richard duke of gloucester to marry warwicks daughters isabel and anne furthermore edwards general popularity was on the wane in this period with higher taxes and persistent disruptions of law and order louis xi of france by  warwick had formed an alliance with edwards jealous and treacherous brother george who married isabel neville in defiance of edwards wishes in calais they raised an army that defeated the kings forces at the battle of edgecote moor edward was captured at olney buckinghamshire and imprisoned at middleham castle in yorkshire warwick briefly had two kings of england in his custody warwick had the queens father richard woodville st earl rivers and her brother john executed however he made no immediate move to have edward declared illegitimate and place george on the throne the country was in turmoil with nobles once again settling scores with private armies in episodes such as the battle of nibley green and lancastrians being encouraged to rebel few of the nobles were prepared to support warwicks seizure of power edward was escorted to london by warwicks brother george neville the archbishop of york where he and warwick were reconciled to outward appearances when further rebellions broke out in lincolnshire edward easily suppressed them at the battle of losecoat field from the testimony of the captured leaders he declared that warwick and george duke of clarence had instigated them they were declared traitors and forced to flee to france where margaret of anjou was already in exile louis xi of france who wished to forestall a hostile alliance between edward and edwards brotherinlaw charles the bold duke of burgundy suggested the idea of an alliance between warwick and margaret neither of those two formerly mortal enemies entertained the notion at first but eventually they were brought round to realise the potential benefits however both were undoubtedly hoping for different outcomes warwick for a puppet king in the form of henry vi or his young son margaret to be able to reclaim her familys realm in any case a marriage was arranged between warwicks daughter anne and margarets son edward of westminster and warwick invaded england in the autumn of  battle of tewkesbury edward iv had already marched north to suppress another uprising in yorkshire warwick with help from a fleet under his nephew the bastard of fauconberg landed at dartmouth and rapidly secured support from the southern counties and ports he occupied london in october and paraded henry vi through the streets as the restored king warwicks brother john neville who had recently received the empty title marquess of montagu and who led large armies in the scottish marches suddenly defected to warwick edward was unprepared for this event and had to order his army to scatter he and richard duke of gloucester fled from doncaster to the coast and thence to holland and exile in burgundy they were proclaimed traitors and many exiled lancastrians returned to reclaim their estates warwicks success was shortlived however he overreached himself with his plan to invade burgundy in alliance with the king of france tempted by king louis promise of territory in the netherlands as a reward this led edwards brotherinlaw charles of burgundy to provide funds and troops to edward to enable him to launch an invasion of england in  edward landed with a small force at ravenspur on the yorkshire coast initially claiming to support henry and to be seeking only to have his title of duke of york restored he soon gained the city of york and rallied several supporters his brother george turned traitor again abandoning warwick having outmaneuvered warwick and montagu edward captured london his army then met warwicks at the battle of barnet the battle was fought in thick fog and some of warwicks men attacked each other by mistake it was believed by all that they had been betrayed and warwicks army fled warwick was cut down trying to reach his horse montagu was also killed in the battle margaret and her son edward had landed in the west country only a few days before the battle of barnet rather than return to france margaret sought to join the lancastrian supporters in wales and marched to cross the severn but was thwarted when the city of gloucester refused her passage across the river her army commanded by the fourth successive duke of somerset was brought to battle and destroyed at the battle of tewkesbury her son prince edward the lancastrian heir to the throne was killed with no heirs to succeed him henry vi was murdered shortly afterwards on  may  to strengthen the yorkist hold on the throne richard iiiedit richard iii the restoration of edward iv in  is sometimes seen as marking the end of the wars of the roses proper peace was restored for the remainder of edwards reign his youngest brother richard duke of gloucester and edwards lifelong companion and supporter william hastings were generously rewarded for their loyalty becoming effectively governors of the north and midlands respectively george of clarence became increasingly estranged from edward and was executed in  for association with convicted traitors when edward died suddenly in  political and dynastic turmoil erupted again many of the nobles still resented the influence of the queens woodville relatives her brother anthony woodville nd earl rivers and her son by her first marriage thomas grey st marquess of dorset and regarded them as powerhungry upstarts parvenus at the time of edwards premature death his heir edward v was only  years old and had been brought up under the stewardship of earl rivers at ludlow castle on his deathbed edward had named his surviving brother richard of gloucester as protector of england richard had been in the north when edward died hastings who also held the office of lord chamberlain sent word to him to bring a strong force to london to counter any force the woodvilles might muster the duke of buckingham also declared his support for richard richard and buckingham overtook earl rivers who was escorting the young edward v to london at stony stratford in buckinghamshire on  april although they dined with rivers amicably they took him prisoner the next day and declared to edward that they had done so to forestall a conspiracy by the woodvilles against his life rivers and his nephew richard grey were sent to pontefract castle in yorkshire and executed there at the end of june princes in the tower painted by john everett millais edward entered london in the custody of richard on  may and was lodged in the tower of london elizabeth woodville had already gone hastily into sanctuary at westminster with her remaining children although preparations were being made for edward v to be crowned on  june at which point richards authority as protector would end on  june richard held a full meeting of the council at which he accused hastings and others of conspiracy against him hastings was executed without trial later in the day thomas bourchier the archbishop of canterbury then persuaded elizabeth woodville to allow her younger son the yearold richard duke of york to join edward in the tower having secured the boys robert stillington bishop of bath and wells then alleged that edward ivs marriage to elizabeth woodville had been illegal and that the two boys were therefore illegitimate parliament agreed and enacted the titulus regius which officially named gloucester as king richard iii the two imprisoned boys known as the princes in the tower disappeared and were possibly murdered by whom and under whose orders remains controversial there was never a trial or judicial inquest on the matter perkin warbeck claimed he was the younger of the princes from  and was recognised as such in international diplomacy outside england having been crowned in a lavish ceremony on  july richard then proceeded on a tour of the midlands and the north of england dispensing generous bounties and charters and naming his own son as the prince of wales buckinghams revoltedit for more details on this topic see buckinghams rebellion opposition to richards rule had already begun in the south when on  october the duke of buckingham who had been instrumental in placing richard on the throne and who himself had a distant claim to the crown led a revolt aimed at installing the lancastrian henry tudor it has been argued that his supporting tudor rather than either edward v or his younger brother showed buckingham was aware that both were already dead the lancastrian claim to the throne had descended to henry tudor on the death of henry vi and his son in  henrys father edmund tudor st earl of richmond had been a halfbrother of henry vi but henrys claim to royalty was through his mother margaret beaufort she was descended from john beaufort who was a son of john of gaunt and thus a grandson of edward iii john beaufort had been illegitimate at birth though later legitimised by the marriage of his parents it had supposedly been a condition of the legitimation that the beaufort descendants forfeited their rights to the crown henry had spent much of his childhood under siege in harlech castle or in exile in brittany after  edward iv had preferred to belittle henrys pretensions to the crown and made only sporadic attempts to secure him however his mother margaret beaufort had been twice remarried first to buckinghams uncle and then to thomas lord stanley one of edwards principal officers and continually promoted her sons rights buckinghams rebellion failed some of his supporters in the south rose up prematurely thus allowing richards lieutenant in the south the duke of norfolk to prevent many rebels from joining forces buckingham himself raised a force at brecon in midwales he was prevented from crossing the river severn to join other rebels in the south of england by storms and floods which also prevented henry tudor landing in the west country buckinghams starving forces deserted and he was betrayed and executed the failure of buckinghams revolt was clearly not the end of the plots against richard who could never again feel secure and who also suffered the loss of his wife and elevenyearold son putting the future of the yorkist dynasty in doubt henry viiedit henry vii many of buckinghams defeated supporters and other disaffected nobles fled to join henry tudor in exile richard made an attempt to bribe the duke of brittanys chief minister pierre landais to betray henry but henry was warned and escaped to france where he was again given sanctuary and aid confident that many magnates and even many of richards officers would join him henry set sail from harfleur on  august  with a force of exiles and french mercenaries with fair winds he landed in pembrokeshire six days later the officers richard had appointed in wales either joined henry or stood aside henry gathered supporters on his march through wales and the welsh marches and defeated richard at the battle of bosworth field richard was slain during the battle supposedly by the major welsh landowner rhys ap thomas with a blow to the head from his poleaxe rhys was knighted three days later by henry vii henry having been acclaimed king henry vii then strengthened his position by marrying elizabeth of york daughter of edward iv and the best surviving yorkist claimant he thus reunited the two royal houses merging the rival symbols of the red rose of lancaster and the white rose of york into the new emblem of the red and white tudor rose henry shored up his position by executing all other possible claimants whenever any excuse was offered a policy his son henry viii continued many historians consider the accession of henry vii to mark the end of the wars of the roses others argue that they continued to the end of the fifteenth century as there were several plots to overthrow henry and restore yorkist claimants only two years after the battle of bosworth yorkists rebelled led by john de la pole earl of lincoln who had been named by richard iii as his heir but had been reconciled with henry after bosworth the conspirators produced a pretender to the throne a boy named lambert simnel who bore a close physical resemblance to the young edward earl of warwick son of george of clarence the best surviving male claimant of the house of york this plan was on very shaky ground because the young earl was still alive and in king henrys custody and was paraded through london to expose the impersonation at the battle of stoke field henry defeated lincolns army lincoln died in the battle simnel was pardoned for his part in the rebellion and was sent to work in the royal kitchens henrys throne was again challenged in  with the appearance of the pretender perkin warbeck who claimed he was richard duke of york the younger of the two princes in the tower warbeck made repeated attempts to incite revolts with support at various times from the court of burgundy and james iv of scotland he was captured after the failed second cornish uprising of  and executed in  after attempting to escape from prison during the reign of henry viis son henry viii the possibility of yorkist challenges to the throne remained until as late as  in the persons of edward stafford rd duke of buckingham edmund de la pole rd duke of suffolk and his brother richard de la pole all of whom had blood ties to the yorkist dynasty but were excluded by the prowoodville tudor settlement to an extent englands break with rome was prompted by henrys fears of a disputed succession should he leave only a female heir to the throne or an infant who would be as vulnerable as henry vi had been to antagonistic or rapacious regents aftermathedit historians debate the extent of impact the wars had on medieval english life the classical view is that the many casualties among the nobility continued the changes in feudal english society caused by the effects of the black death these included a weakening of the feudal power of the nobles and an increase in the power of the merchant classes and the growth of a centralised monarchy under the tudors the wars heralded the end of the medieval period in england and the movement towards the renaissance after the wars the large standing baronial armies that had helped fuel the conflict were suppressed henry vii wary of any further fighting kept the barons on a very tight leash removing their right to raise arm and supply armies of retainers so that they could not make war on each other or the king the military power of individual barons declined and the tudor court became a place where baronial squabbles were decided with the influence of the monarch revisionists such as the oxford historian k b mcfarlane suggest that the effects of the conflicts have been greatly exaggerated and that there were no wars of the roses many places were unaffected by the wars particularly in the eastern part of england such as east anglia it has also been suggested that the traumatic impact of the wars was exaggerated by henry vii to magnify his achievement in quelling them and bringing peace the effect of the wars on the merchant and labouring classes was far less than in the long drawnout wars of siege and pillage in europe which were carried out by mercenaries who profited from long wars although there were some lengthy sieges such as those of harlech castle and bamburgh castle these were in comparatively remote and less populous regions in the populated areas both factions had much to lose by the ruin of the country and sought quick resolution of the conflict by pitched battle philippe de commines observed in  the realm of england enjoys one favour above all other realms that neither the countryside nor the people are destroyed nor are buildings burnt or demolished misfortune falls on soldiers and nobles in particular exceptions to this claimed general rule were the lancastrian looting of ludlow after the largely bloodless yorkist defeat at ludford bridge in  and the widespread pillaging carried out by queen margarets unpaid army as it advanced south in early  both events inspired widespread opposition to the queen and support for the yorkists many areas did little or nothing to change their city defences perhaps an indication that they were left untouched by the wars city walls were either left in their ruinous state or only partially rebuilt in the case of london the city was able to avoid being devastated by convincing the york and lancaster armies to stay out after the inability to recreate the defensive city walls few noble houses were extinguished during the wars in the period from  to  before the outbreak of the wars there were as many extinctions of noble lines from natural causes  as occurred during the fighting  from  to  the most ambitious nobles died and by the later period of the wars fewer nobles were prepared to risk their lives and titles in an uncertain strugglecitation needed the kings of france and scotland and the dukes of burgundy played the two factions off against each other pledging military and financial aid and offering asylum to defeated nobles and pretenders to prevent a strong and unified england from making war on them

unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message following defeat in the hundred years war english landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings this is often considered a contributory cause of the wars of the roses the wars were fought largely by the landed aristocracy and armies of feudal retainers with some mercenaries at the end of the hundred years war large numbers of unemployed soldiery returned to england seeking employment in the growing armies of local nobility england drifted toward misrule and violence under the weak governance as local noble families like the nevilles and percies increasingly relied on their feudal retainers to settle disputes it became common practice for landowners to bind their mesnie knights to their service with annual payments half of an indenture contract the randomly cut or indented edge proves a match to the counterpart document edward iii had developed the contract system where the monarch entered into formal written contracts called indenture with experienced captains who were contractually obligated to provide an agreed upon number of men at established rates for a given period frequently the landed nobility acted the principal or main contractor knights men at arms and archers were often subcontracted in addition to professional retainers a lord could find men amongst his tenantry these included landless men and others who would crave the security of maintenance and livery skilled archers could command as high a wage as knights as baronial armies grew in size the rule of law was weakened support for each house largely depended upon dynastic factors such as blood relationships marriages within the nobility and the grants or confiscations of feudal titles and lands given the conflicting loyalties of blood marriage and ambition it was not uncommon for nobles to switch sides several battles such as northampton and bosworth were decided by treacherycitation needed the armies consisted of nobles contingents of menatarms with companies of archers and footsoldiers such as billmen there were also sometimes contingents of foreign mercenaries armed with cannon or handguns the horsemen were generally restricted to prickers and scourers ie scouting and foraging parties the rules of military engagement changed as civil war succeeded overseas campaigns it was customary for the heavy cavalry to fight entirely on foot in several cases noblemen dismounted and fought among the common footsoldiers to inspire them and to dispel the notion that in the case of defeat they might be ransomed while the common soldiers being of little value faced death it was often claimed however that the nobles faced greater risks than the ordinary soldiers as there was little incentive for anyone to take prisoner any highranking noble during or immediately after a battle during the hundred years war against france a captured noble would be able to ransom himself for a large sum but in the wars of the roses a captured noble who belonged to a defeated faction had a high chance of being executed as a traitor for example fortytwo captured knights were executed after the battle of towton the burgundian observer philippe de commines who met edward iv in  reported king edward told me in all the battles which he had won as soon as he had gained victory he mounted his horse and shouted to his men that they must spare the common soldiers and kill the lords of whom none or few escaped even those who escaped execution might be declared attainted and therefore possessing no property and of no value to a captorref chronological list of battlesedit first battle of st albans

losecoat field barnet tewkesbury bosworth field stoke field the wars of the roses were a series of wars for control of the throne of england fought between supporters of two rival branches of the royal house of plantagenet the house of lancaster associated with a red rose and the house of york whose symbol was a white rose the conflict lasted through many sporadic episodes between  and  however there was fighting before and after this period between the houses the power struggle ignited around social and financial troubles following the hundred years war combined with the mental infirmity and weak rule of henry vi which revived interest in richard of yorks claim to the throne historians disagree about whether the wars of the roses were caused by the structural problems of bastard feudalism or henry vis ineffectiveness as king with the duke of yorks death the claim transferred to his heir edward who later became the first yorkist king of england as edward iv his son reigned for  days as edward v but parliament then decided that edward and his brother richard were illegitimate and offered the crown to edward ivs younger brother who became richard iii the two young princes disappeared within the confines of the tower of london the final victory went to a claimant of the lancastrian party henry tudor earl of richmond who defeated the last yorkist king richard iii

associated with the two royal houses the white rose of york and the red rose of lancaster wars of the roses came into common use in the nineteenth century after the publication in  of anne of geierstein by sir walter scott scott based the name on a scene in william shakespeares play henry vi part  set in the gardens of the temple church where a number of noblemen and a lawyer pick red or white roses to show their loyalty to the lancastrian or yorkist faction respectively the yorkist faction used the symbol of the white rose from early in the conflict but the lancastrian red rose was apparently introduced only after the victory of henry tudor at the battle of bosworth when it was combined with the yorkist white rose to form the tudor rose which symbolised the union of the two houses the origins of the rose as a cognizance itself stem from edward is use of a golden rose stalked proper often owing to nobles holding multiple titles more than one badge was used edward iv for example used both his sun in splendour as earl of march but also his fathers falcon and fetterlock as duke of york badges were not always distinct at the battle of barnet edwards sun was very similar to the earl of oxfords vere star which caused fateful confusion most but not all of the participants in the wars wore livery badges associated with their immediate lords or patrons under the prevailing system of bastard feudalism the wearing of livery was by now confined to those in continuous employ of a lord thus excluding for example mercenaries another example henry tudors forces at bosworth fought under the banner of a red dragon while the yorkist army used richard iiis personal device of a white boar although the names of the rival houses derive from the cities of york and lancaster the corresponding duchies had little to do with these cities the lands and offices attached to the duchy of lancaster were mainly in gloucestershire north wales and cheshire while the estates and castles that were part of the duchy of york were spread throughout england and wales although many were in the welsh marches summary of eventsedit this section does not cite any sources

in the wars of the roses although minor armed clashes had occurred previously between supporters of york and lancaster the first open fighting broke out in  at the first battle of st albans several prominent lancastrians died at the hands of the yorkists although peace was temporarily restored the lancastrians were inspired by margaret of anjou to contest yorks influence and a deadly feud between the two branches of the royal family ensued fighting resumed more violently in  york and his supporters were forced to flee the country but one of his most prominent supporters the earl of warwick invaded england from calais and captured henry vi at the battle of northampton york returned to the country and became protector of england but was dissuaded from claiming the throne margaret and the remaining lancastrian nobles gathered their army in the north of england when york moved north to engage them he and his second son edmund were killed at the battle of wakefield in december  the lancastrian army advanced south and released henry at the second battle of st albans but failed to occupy london and subsequently retreated to the north yorks eldest son edward earl of march was proclaimed king edward iv he gathered the yorkist armies and won a crushing victory at the battle of towton in march  after lancastrian revolts in the north were suppressed in  and henry was captured once again and placed in the tower of london edward fell out with his chief supporter and adviser the earl of warwick known as the kingmaker after edwards unpopular and secretly conducted marriage with the widow of a lancastrian supporter elizabeth woodville within a few years it became clear that edward was favoring his wifes family and alienating a number of friends closely aligned with warwick as well a nearcontemporary flemish picture of the battle of barnet in  furious warwick tried first to supplant edward with his younger brother george duke of clarence establishing the alliance by marriage to his daughter isabel neville when that plan failed due to lack of support from parliament warwick sailed to france with his family and made an alliance with the lancastrian queen margaret of anjou to restore henry vi to the throne this resulted in two years of rapid changes of fortune before edward iv once again won complete victories at barnet april  where warwick was killed and tewkesbury may  where the lancastrian heir edward of westminster prince of wales was killed or perhaps executed after the battle queen margaret was escorted to london as a prisoner and henry was murdered in the tower of london several days later ending the direct lancastrian line of succession a period of comparative peace followed ending with the unexpected death of king edward in  his surviving brother richard duke of gloucester first moved to prevent the unpopular woodville family of edwards widow from participating in the government during the minority of edwards son edward v and then seized the throne for himself using the suspect legitimacy of edward ivs marriage as pretext henry tudor a distant relative of the lancastrian kings who had inherited their claim defeated richard iii at bosworth in  he was crowned henry vii and married elizabeth of york daughter of edward iv to unite and reconcile the two houses yorkist revolts directed by john de la pole st earl of lincoln and others flared up in  under the banner of the pretender lambert simnel—who claimed he was edward earl of warwick son of george of clarence resulting in the last pitched battles though most surviving descendants of richard of york were imprisoned sporadic rebellions continued until  when perkin warbeck who claimed he was the younger brother of edward v one of the two disappeared princes in the tower was imprisoned and later executed origins of the conflictedit disputed successionedit william the conquerors son king henry i of england died in  after his only male heir was killed aboard the white ship following the white ship disaster england entered a period of prolonged instability known as the anarchy however following the ascension of henry ii plantagenet to the throne in  the crown passed from father to son or brother to brother with little difficulty until  henry iv the question of succession after edward iiis death in  is said to be the cause of the wars of roses although edward iii had five legitimate sons there was a sudden narrowing in the direct line of descent near the end of his reign edwards eldest son edward the black prince had died the year before the black princes own eldest son edward of angoulême had died in  edward iii was succeeded on the throne by the black princes younger son richard ii who was only  years old richards claim to the throne was based on the principle that the son of an elder brother had priority in the succession over his uncles since richard was a minor and had three living uncles at the time of edward iiis death there was considerable uncertainty about who was next in line for the succession by custom roger mortimer who claimed descent from king edward through his mother philippa of clarence edward iiis eldest grandchild had the best claim to succeed however a legal decree issued by edward iii in  had introduced some complexity into the question of who would ultimately take the throne the letters patent issued by edward iii limited the right of succession to male heirs which placed richards uncle john of gaunt duke of lancaster and his male descendants ahead of philippas male children in the succession richard iis reign was marked by increasing dissension between the king and several of the most powerful nobles in  he exiled gaunts son henry of bolingbroke richards government had become highly unpopular beyond his strongholds in cheshire and wales and when bolingbroke returned from exile in  initially to reclaim his rights as duke of lancaster he took advantage of the support of most of the nobles to depose richard and was crowned king henry iv establishing the house of lancaster on the throne house of lancasteredit henry v henry ivs claim to the throne was through his father john of gaunt third surviving son of edward iii the childless richard ii had nominated edmund mortimer th earl of march as his successor but there was little support at the time for the counterclaim of the young mortimer as henrys initial popularity waned the mortimer familys claim to the throne was a pretext for the major rebellion of owain glyndŵr in wales and other less successful revolts in cheshire and northumberland there were uprisings in support of the mortimers claim throughout henry ivs reign which lasted until  an important branch of the house of lancaster were the beauforts who were descended from gaunt by his mistress katherine swynford when gaunt and katherine later married their descendants were made legitimate by an act of parliament however henry iv excluded them from the line of succession to the throne henry ivs son and successor henry v inherited a temporarily pacified nation and his military success against france in the hundred years war bolstered his popularity enabling him to strengthen the lancastrian hold on the throne nevertheless one notable conspiracy against henry the southampton plot took place during his nineyear reign this was led by richard earl of cambridge who was executed for treason in  at the start of the campaign that led to the battle of agincourt house of yorkedit the founder of the house of york was edmund of langley the fourth son of edward iii and the younger brother of john of gaunt his son richard earl of cambridge had married anne de mortimer the mortimers were members of the most powerful marcher family of the fourteenth century gm trevelyan has written that the wars of the roses were to a large extent a quarrel between welsh marcer lords who were also great english nobles closely related to the english throne anne herself was descended from edward iii through her mother philippa of clarence daughter of lionel of antwerp edwards second son anne mortimers husband richard earl of cambridge anne had died in  when her brother edmund earl of march who had loyally supported henry died childless in  the title and extensive estates of the earldom of march and the mortimer claim to the throne thus passed to annes descendants richard of york the son of cambridge and anne mortimer was four years old at the time of his fathers execution although cambridge was attainted henry v later allowed richard to inherit the title and lands of cambridges elder brother edward duke of york who had died fighting alongside henry at agincourt and had no issue henry who had three younger brothers and was himself in his prime and recently married to the french princess catherine of valois had no doubt that the lancastrian right to the crown was secure henrys premature death in  at the age of  led to his only son henry vi coming to the throne as an infant and the country being ruled by regents henry vs younger brothers produced no surviving legitimate issue leaving only distant cousins the beauforts as alternative lancaster heirs as richard of york grew into maturity and questions were raised over henry vis fitness to rule richards claim to the throne thus became more significant the revenue from the york and march estates also made him the wealthiest magnate in the land henry viedit from early childhood henry vi was surrounded by quarrelsome councillors and advisors his younger surviving paternal uncle humphrey duke of gloucester sought to be named protector and deliberately courted the popularity of the common people for his own ends but was opposed by cardinal beaufort on several occasions beaufort called on john duke of bedford humphreys older brother to return from his post as regent in france either to mediate or to defend him against humphreys accusations of treason some time after bedford died in  cardinal beaufort withdrew from public affairs partly due to old age and partly because william de la pole st duke of suffolk rose to become the dominant personality at court suffolk was widely held to be enriching himself through his influence on henry and was blamed for mismanaging the government and poorly executing the continuing hundred years war with france under henry vi all the land in france won by henry v and even the provinces of guienne and gascony which had been held since the reign of henry ii three centuries previously were lost henry vi suffolk eventually succeeded in having humphrey of gloucester arrested for treason humphrey died while awaiting trial in prison at bury st edmunds in  some authorities date the start of the war of the roses from the death of humphrey however with severe reverses in france suffolk was stripped of office and was murdered on his way to exile edmund beaufort nd duke of somerset succeeded him as leader of the party seeking peace with france the duke of york who had succeeded bedford as lieutenant in france meanwhile represented those who wished to prosecute the war more vigorously and criticised the court and somerset in particular for starving him of funds and men during his campaigns in france in all these quarrels henry vi had taken little part he was seen as a weak ineffectual king in addition he displayed several symptoms of mental illness that he may have inherited from his maternal grandfather charles vi of france by  many considered henry incapable of carrying out the duties and responsibilities of a king in  there was a violent popular revolt in kent jack cades rebellion which is often seen as the prelude to the wars of the roses the rebel manifesto the complaint of the poor commons of kent was written under cades leadership it accused the crown of extortion perversion of justice and election fraud the rebels occupied parts of london and executed james fiennes st baron saye and sele the unpopular lord high treasurer after a hasty trial after some of them fell to looting they were driven out of london by the citizens they dispersed after they were supposedly pardoned but several including cade were later executed after the rebellion the rebels grievances formed the basis of richard of yorks opposition of a royal government from which he felt excluded two years later in  richard of york returned to england from his new post as lieutenant of ireland and marched on london demanding somersets removal and reform of the government at this stage few of the nobles supported such drastic action and york was forced to submit to superior force at blackheath he was imprisoned for much of  and  but was released after swearing not to take arms against the court the increasing discord at court was mirrored in the country as a whole where noble families engaged in private feuds and showed increasing disrespect for the royal authority and for the courts of law in many cases feuds were fought between oldestablished families and formerly minor nobility raised in power and influence by henry iv in the aftermath of the rebellions against him the quarrel between the percys—long the earls of northumberland—and the comparatively upstart nevilles was the bestknown of these private wars and followed this pattern as did the bonville–courtenay feud in cornwall and devon a factor in these feuds was the presence of large numbers of soldiers discharged from the english armies that had been defeated in france nobles engaged many of these to mount raids or to pack courts of justice with their supporters intimidating suitors witnesses and judges this growing civil discontent the abundance of feuding nobles with private armies and corruption in henry vis court formed a political climate ripe for civil war with the king so easily manipulated power rested with those closest to him at court in other words somerset and the lancastrian faction richard and the yorkist faction who tended to be physically placed further away from the seat of power found their power slowly being stripped away royal power and finances also started to slip as henry was persuaded to grant many royal lands and estates to the lancastrians thereby losing their revenue in  henry suffered the first of several bouts of complete mental collapse during which he failed even to recognise his newborn son edward of westminster on  march  cardinal john kemp the chancellor died henry was incapable of nominating a successor to ensure that the country could be governed a council of regency was set up headed by the duke of york who still remained popular with the people as lord protector york soon asserted his power with evergreater boldness although there is no proof that he had aspirations to the throne at this early stage he imprisoned somerset and backed his neville allies his brotherinlaw the earl of salisbury and salisburys son the earl of warwick in their continuing feud with the earl of northumberland a powerful supporter of henry henry recovered in  and once again fell under the influence of those closest to him at court directed by henrys queen the powerful and aggressive margaret of anjou who emerged as the de facto leader of the lancastrians richard was forced out of court margaret built up an alliance against richard and conspired with other nobles to reduce his influence an increasingly thwarted richard who feared arrest for treason finally resorted to armed hostilities in  start of the waredit the lancastrian siege of london in  is attacked by a yorkist sally richard duke of york led a small force toward london and was met by henrys forces at st albans north of london on  may  the relatively small first battle of st albans was the first open conflict of the civil war richards aim was ostensibly to remove poor advisors from king henrys side the result was a lancastrian defeat several prominent lancastrian leaders including somerset and northumberland were killed after the battle the yorkists found henry hiding in a local tanners shop abandoned by his advisers and servants apparently having suffered another bout of mental illness he had also been slightly wounded in the neck by an arrow york and his allies regained their position of influence with the king indisposed york was again appointed protector and margaret was shunted aside charged with the kings care for a while both sides seemed shocked that an actual battle had been fought and did their best to reconcile their differences but the problems that caused conflict soon reemerged particularly the issue of whether the duke of york or henry and margarets infant son edward would succeed to the throne margaret refused to accept any solution that would disinherit her son and it became clear that she would only tolerate the situation for as long as the duke of york and his allies retained the military ascendancy henry recovered and in february  he relieved york of his office of protector in the autumn of that year henry went on royal progress in the midlands where the king and queen were popular margaret did not allow him to return to london where the merchants were angry at the decline in trade and the widespread disorder the kings court was set up at coventry by then the new duke of somerset was emerging as a favourite of the royal court margaret persuaded henry to revoke the appointments york had made as protector while york was made to return to his post as lieutenant in ireland disorder in the capital and the north of england where fighting between the nevilles and percys had resumed  and piracy by french fleets on the south coast were growing but the king and queen remained intent on protecting their own positions with the queen introducing conscription for the first time in england meanwhile yorks ally warwick later dubbed the kingmaker was growing in popularity in london as the champion of the merchants as captain of calais he had fought piracy in the channel in the spring of  thomas bourchier the archbishop of canterbury attempted to arrange a reconciliation the lords had gathered in london for a grand council and the city was full of armed retainers the archbishop negotiated complex settlements to resolve the bloodfeuds that had persisted since the battle of st albans then on lady day  march the king led a love day procession to st pauls cathedral with lancastrian and yorkist nobles following him hand in hand no sooner had the procession and the council dispersed than plotting resumed act of accordedit ludlow castle south shropshire the next outbreak of fighting was prompted by warwicks highhanded actions as captain of calais he led his ships in attacks on neutral hanseatic league and spanish ships in the channel on flimsy grounds of sovereignty he was summoned to london to face enquiries but he claimed that attempts had been made on his life and returned to calais york salisbury and warwick were summoned to a royal council at coventry but they refused fearing arrest when they were isolated from their own supporters york summoned the nevilles to join him at his stronghold at ludlow castle in the welsh marches on  september  at the battle of blore heath in staffordshire a lancastrian army failed to prevent salisbury from marching from middleham castle in yorkshire to ludlow shortly afterwards the combined yorkist armies confronted the much larger lancastrian force at the battle of ludford bridge warwicks contingent from the garrison of calais under andrew trollope defected to the lancastrians and the yorkist leaders fled york returned to ireland and his eldest son edward earl of march salisbury and warwick fled to calais the lancastrians were back in total control york and his supporters were attainted at the parliament of devils as traitors somerset was appointed governor of calais and was dispatched to take over the vital fortress on the french coast but his attempts to evict warwick were easily repulsed warwick and his supporters even began to launch raids on the english coast from calais adding to the sense of chaos and disorder being attainted only by a successful invasion could the yorkists recover their lands and titles warwick travelled to ireland to concert plans with york evading the royal ships commanded by the duke of exeter in late june  warwick salisbury and edward of march crossed the channel and rapidly established themselves in kent and london where they enjoyed wide support backed by a papal emissary who had taken their side they marched north king henry led an army south to meet them while margaret remained in the north with prince edward at the battle of northampton on  july the yorkist army under warwick defeated the lancastrians aided by treachery in the kings ranks for the second time in the war king henry was found by the yorkists in a tent abandoned by his retinue having apparently suffered another breakdown with the king in their possession the yorkists returned to london in the light of this military success richard of york moved to press his claim to the throne based on the illegitimacy of the lancastrian line landing in north wales he and his wife cecily entered london with all the ceremony usually reserved for a monarch parliament was assembled and when york entered he made straight for the throne which he may have been expecting the lords to encourage him to take for himself as they had acclaimed henry iv in  instead there was stunned silence york announced his claim to the throne but the lords even warwick and salisbury were shocked by his presumption they had no desire at this stage to overthrow king henry their ambition was still limited to the removal of his councillors the next day york produced detailed genealogies to support his claim based on his descent from lionel of antwerp duke of clarence yorks claim was through a daughter of a second son henrys through the son of a third son the judges felt that common law principles could not determine who had priority in the royal succession and declared the matter above the law and passed ther lernyng parliament agreed to consider the matter and accepted that yorks claim was better but by a majority of five they voted that henry vi should remain as king a compromise was struck in october  with the act of accord which recognised york as henrys successor disinheriting henrys sixyearold son edward york accepted this compromise as the best offer it gave him much of what he wanted particularly since he was also made protector of the realm and was able to govern in henrys name death of richard duke of yorkedit ruins of sandal castle near wakefield west yorkshire queen margaret and her son had fled to north wales parts of which were still in lancastrian hands they later travelled by sea to scotland to negotiate for scottish assistance mary of gueldres queen consort to james ii of scotland agreed to give margaret an army on condition that she cede the town of berwick to scotland and marys daughter be betrothed to prince edward margaret agreed although she had no funds to pay her army and could only promise booty from the riches of southern england as long as no looting took place north of the river trent the duke of york left london later that year with the earl of salisbury to consolidate his position in the north against the lancastrians who were reported to be massing near the city of york he took up a defensive position at sandal castle near wakefield over christmas  then on  december his forces left the castle and attacked the lancastrians in the open although outnumbered the ensuing battle of wakefield was a complete lancastrian victory richard of york was slain in the battle and both salisbury and yorks yearold second son edmund earl of rutland were captured and executed margaret ordered the heads of all three placed on the gates of york edwards claim to the throneedit parhelion at sunset the act of accord and the events of wakefield left the yearold edward earl of march yorks eldest son as duke of york and heir to his claim to the throne with an army from the proyorkist marches the border area between england and wales he met jasper tudors lancastrian army arriving from wales and he defeated them soundly at the battle of mortimers cross in herefordshire he inspired his men with a vision of three suns at dawn a phenomenon known as parhelion telling them that it was a portent of victory and represented the three surviving york sons himself george and richard this led to edwards later adoption of the sign of the sunne in splendour as his personal device margarets army was moving south supporting itself by looting as it passed through the prosperous south of england in london warwick used this as propaganda to reinforce yorkist support throughout the south – the town of coventry switched allegiance to the yorkists warwicks army established fortified positions north of the town of st albans to block the main road from the north but was outmanoeuvred by margarets army which swerved to the west and then attacked warwicks positions from behind at the second battle of st albans the lancastrians won another big victory as the yorkist forces fled they left behind king henry who was found unharmed sitting quietly beneath a tree henry knighted thirty lancastrian soldiers immediately after the battle in an illustration of the increasing bitterness of the war queen margaret instructed her sevenyearold son edward of westminster to determine the manner of execution of the yorkist knights who had been charged with keeping henry safe and had stayed at his side throughout the battle as the lancastrian army advanced southwards a wave of dread swept london where rumours were rife about savage northerners intent on plundering the city the people of london shut the city gates and refused to supply food to the queens army which was looting the surrounding counties of hertfordshire and middlesex yorkist triumphedit edward iv edward of march having joined with warwicks surviving forces advanced towards london from the west at the same time that the queen retreated northwards to dunstable as a result edward and warwick were able to enter london with their army they found considerable support there as the city was largely yorkistsupporting it was clear that edward was no longer simply trying to free the king from bad councillors but that his goal was to take the crown thomas kempe the bishop of london asked the people of london their opinion and they replied with shouts of king edward the request was quickly approved by parliament and edward was unofficially crowned in an impromptu ceremony at westminster abbey edward vowed that he would not have a formal coronation until henry vi and his wife were removed from the scene edward claimed henry had forfeited his right to the crown by allowing his queen to take up arms against his rightful heirs under the act of accord parliament had already accepted that edwards victory was simply a restoration of the rightful heir to the throne edward and warwick marched north gathering a large army as they went and met an equally impressive lancastrian army at towton the battle of towton near york was the biggest battle of the wars of the roses both sides agreed beforehand that the issue would be settled that day with no quarter asked or given an estimated – men took part with over  men being killed during and after the battle an enormous number for the time and the greatest recorded single days loss of life on english soil edward and his army won a decisive victory and the lancastrians were routed with most of their leaders slain henry and margaret who were waiting in york with their son edward fled north when they heard the outcome many of the surviving lancastrian nobles switched allegiance to king edward and those who did not were driven back to the northern border areas and a few castles in wales edward advanced to take york where he replaced the rotting heads of his father his brother and salisbury with those of defeated lancastrian lords such as the notorious john clifford th baron de clifford of skiptoncraven who was blamed for the execution of edwards brother edmund earl of rutland after the battle of wakefield edward ivedit harlech castle gwynedd wales the official coronation of edward iv took place in june  in london where he received a rapturous welcome from his supporters after the battle of towton henry vi and margaret had fled to scotland where they stayed with the court of james iii and followed through on their promise to cede berwick to scotland later in the year they mounted an attack on carlisle but lacking money they were easily repulsed by edwards men who were rooting out the remaining lancastrian forces in the northern counties several castles under lancastrian commanders held out for years dunstanburgh alnwick the percy family seat and bamburgh were some of the last to fall there was also some fighting in ireland at the battle of piltown in  the yorkish supporter thomas fitzgerald th earl of desmond defeated the lancastrian butlers of kilkenny the butlers suffered more than  casualties local folklore claims that the battle was so violent that the local river ran red with blood hence the names pill river and piltown baile an phuill meaning town of the blood there were lancastrian revolts in the north of england in  several lancastrian nobles including the third duke of somerset who had apparently been reconciled to edward readily led the rebellion the revolt was put down by warwicks brother john neville a small lancastrian army was destroyed at the battle of hedgeley moor on  april but because neville was escorting scottish commissioners for a treaty to york he could not immediately follow up this victory then on  may he routed somersets army at the battle of hexham somerset was captured and executed the deposed king henry was later captured for the third time at clitheroe in lancashire in  he was taken to london and held prisoner at the tower of london where for the time being he was reasonably well treated about the same time once england under edward iv and scotland had come to terms margaret and her son were forced to leave scotland and sail to france where they maintained an impoverished court in exile for several years the last remaining lancastrian stronghold was harlech castle in wales which surrendered in  after a sevenyearlong siege warwicks rebellion and the death of henry viedit middleham castle the powerful earl of warwick the kingmaker had meanwhile become the greatest landowner in england already a great magnate through his wifes property he had also inherited his fathers estates and had been granted much forfeited lancastrian property he also held many of the offices of state he was convinced of the need for an alliance with france and had been negotiating a match between edward and a french bride however edward had married elizabeth woodville the widow of a lancastrian knight in secret in  he later announced the news of his marriage as fait accompli to warwicks considerable embarrassment this embarrassment turned to bitterness when the woodvilles came to be favoured over the nevilles at court many of queen elizabeths relatives were married into noble families and others were granted peerages or royal offices other factors compounded warwicks disillusionment edwards preference for an alliance with burgundy rather than france and reluctance to allow his brothers george duke of clarence and richard duke of gloucester to marry warwicks daughters isabel and anne furthermore edwards general popularity was on the wane in this period with higher taxes and persistent disruptions of law and order louis xi of france by  warwick had formed an alliance with edwards jealous and treacherous brother george who married isabel neville in defiance of edwards wishes in calais they raised an army that defeated the kings forces at the battle of edgecote moor edward was captured at olney buckinghamshire and imprisoned at middleham castle in yorkshire warwick briefly had two kings of england in his custody warwick had the queens father richard woodville st earl rivers and her brother john executed however he made no immediate move to have edward declared illegitimate and place george on the throne the country was in turmoil with nobles once again settling scores with private armies in episodes such as the battle of nibley green and lancastrians being encouraged to rebel few of the nobles were prepared to support warwicks seizure of power edward was escorted to london by warwicks brother george neville the archbishop of york where he and warwick were reconciled to outward appearances when further rebellions broke out in lincolnshire edward easily suppressed them at the battle of losecoat field from the testimony of the captured leaders he declared that warwick and george duke of clarence had instigated them they were declared traitors and forced to flee to france where margaret of anjou was already in exile louis xi of france who wished to forestall a hostile alliance between edward and edwards brotherinlaw charles the bold duke of burgundy suggested the idea of an alliance between warwick and margaret neither of those two formerly mortal enemies entertained the notion at first but eventually they were brought round to realise the potential benefits however both were undoubtedly hoping for different outcomes warwick for a puppet king in the form of henry vi or his young son margaret to be able to reclaim her familys realm in any case a marriage was arranged between warwicks daughter anne and margarets son edward of westminster and warwick invaded england in the autumn of  battle of tewkesbury edward iv had already marched north to suppress another uprising in yorkshire warwick with help from a fleet under his nephew the bastard of fauconberg landed at dartmouth and rapidly secured support from the southern counties and ports he occupied london in october and paraded henry vi through the streets as the restored king warwicks brother john neville who had recently received the empty title marquess of montagu and who led large armies in the scottish marches suddenly defected to warwick edward was unprepared for this event and had to order his army to scatter he and richard duke of gloucester fled from doncaster to the coast and thence to holland and exile in burgundy they were proclaimed traitors and many exiled lancastrians returned to reclaim their estates warwicks success was shortlived however he overreached himself with his plan to invade burgundy in alliance with the king of france tempted by king louis promise of territory in the netherlands as a reward this led edwards brotherinlaw charles of burgundy to provide funds and troops to edward to enable him to launch an invasion of england in  edward landed with a small force at ravenspur on the yorkshire coast initially claiming to support henry and to be seeking only to have his title of duke of york restored he soon gained the city of york and rallied several supporters his brother george turned traitor again abandoning warwick having outmaneuvered warwick and montagu edward captured london his army then met warwicks at the battle of barnet the battle was fought in thick fog and some of warwicks men attacked each other by mistake it was believed by all that they had been betrayed and warwicks army fled warwick was cut down trying to reach his horse montagu was also killed in the battle margaret and her son edward had landed in the west country only a few days before the battle of barnet rather than return to france margaret sought to join the lancastrian supporters in wales and marched to cross the severn but was thwarted when the city of gloucester refused her passage across the river her army commanded by the fourth successive duke of somerset was brought to battle and destroyed at the battle of tewkesbury her son prince edward the lancastrian heir to the throne was killed with no heirs to succeed him henry vi was murdered shortly afterwards on  may  to strengthen the yorkist hold on the throne richard iiiedit richard iii the restoration of edward iv in  is sometimes seen as marking the end of the wars of the roses proper peace was restored for the remainder of edwards reign his youngest brother richard duke of gloucester and edwards lifelong companion and supporter william hastings were generously rewarded for their loyalty becoming effectively governors of the north and midlands respectively george of clarence became increasingly estranged from edward and was executed in  for association with convicted traitors when edward died suddenly in  political and dynastic turmoil erupted again many of the nobles still resented the influence of the queens woodville relatives her brother anthony woodville nd earl rivers and her son by her first marriage thomas grey st marquess of dorset and regarded them as powerhungry upstarts parvenus at the time of edwards premature death his heir edward v was only  years old and had been brought up under the stewardship of earl rivers at ludlow castle on his deathbed edward had named his surviving brother richard of gloucester as protector of england richard had been in the north when edward died hastings who also held the office of lord chamberlain sent word to him to bring a strong force to london to counter any force the woodvilles might muster the duke of buckingham also declared his support for richard richard and buckingham overtook earl rivers who was escorting the young edward v to london at stony stratford in buckinghamshire on  april although they dined with rivers amicably they took him prisoner the next day and declared to edward that they had done so to forestall a conspiracy by the woodvilles against his life rivers and his nephew richard grey were sent to pontefract castle in yorkshire and executed there at the end of june princes in the tower painted by john everett millais edward entered london in the custody of richard on  may and was lodged in the tower of london elizabeth woodville had already gone hastily into sanctuary at westminster with her remaining children although preparations were being made for edward v to be crowned on  june at which point richards authority as protector would end on  june richard held a full meeting of the council at which he accused hastings and others of conspiracy against him hastings was executed without trial later in the day thomas bourchier the archbishop of canterbury then persuaded elizabeth woodville to allow her younger son the yearold richard duke of york to join edward in the tower having secured the boys robert stillington bishop of bath and wells then alleged that edward ivs marriage to elizabeth woodville had been illegal and that the two boys were therefore illegitimate parliament agreed and enacted the titulus regius which officially named gloucester as king richard iii the two imprisoned boys known as the princes in the tower disappeared and were possibly murdered by whom and under whose orders remains controversial there was never a trial or judicial inquest on the matter perkin warbeck claimed he was the younger of the princes from  and was recognised as such in international diplomacy outside england having been crowned in a lavish ceremony on  july richard then proceeded on a tour of the midlands and the north of england dispensing generous bounties and charters and naming his own son as the prince of wales buckinghams revoltedit for more details on this topic see buckinghams rebellion opposition to richards rule had already begun in the south when on  october the duke of buckingham who had been instrumental in placing richard on the throne and who himself had a distant claim to the crown led a revolt aimed at installing the lancastrian henry tudor it has been argued that his supporting tudor rather than either edward v or his younger brother showed buckingham was aware that both were already dead the lancastrian claim to the throne had descended to henry tudor on the death of henry vi and his son in  henrys father edmund tudor st earl of richmond had been a halfbrother of henry vi but henrys claim to royalty was through his mother margaret beaufort she was descended from john beaufort who was a son of john of gaunt and thus a grandson of edward iii john beaufort had been illegitimate at birth though later legitimised by the marriage of his parents it had supposedly been a condition of the legitimation that the beaufort descendants forfeited their rights to the crown henry had spent much of his childhood under siege in harlech castle or in exile in brittany after  edward iv had preferred to belittle henrys pretensions to the crown and made only sporadic attempts to secure him however his mother margaret beaufort had been twice remarried first to buckinghams uncle and then to thomas lord stanley one of edwards principal officers and continually promoted her sons rights buckinghams rebellion failed some of his supporters in the south rose up prematurely thus allowing richards lieutenant in the south the duke of norfolk to prevent many rebels from joining forces buckingham himself raised a force at brecon in midwales he was prevented from crossing the river severn to join other rebels in the south of england by storms and floods which also prevented henry tudor landing in the west country buckinghams starving forces deserted and he was betrayed and executed the failure of buckinghams revolt was clearly not the end of the plots against richard who could never again feel secure and who also suffered the loss of his wife and elevenyearold son putting the future of the yorkist dynasty in doubt henry viiedit henry vii many of buckinghams defeated supporters and other disaffected nobles fled to join henry tudor in exile richard made an attempt to bribe the duke of brittanys chief minister pierre landais to betray henry but henry was warned and escaped to france where he was again given sanctuary and aid confident that many magnates and even many of richards officers would join him henry set sail from harfleur on  august  with a force of exiles and french mercenaries with fair winds he landed in pembrokeshire six days later the officers richard had appointed in wales either joined henry or stood aside henry gathered supporters on his march through wales and the welsh marches and defeated richard at the battle of bosworth field richard was slain during the battle supposedly by the major welsh landowner rhys ap thomas with a blow to the head from his poleaxe rhys was knighted three days later by henry vii henry having been acclaimed king henry vii then strengthened his position by marrying elizabeth of york daughter of edward iv and the best surviving yorkist claimant he thus reunited the two royal houses merging the rival symbols of the red rose of lancaster and the white rose of york into the new emblem of the red and white tudor rose henry shored up his position by executing all other possible claimants whenever any excuse was offered a policy his son henry viii continued many historians consider the accession of henry vii to mark the end of the wars of the roses others argue that they continued to the end of the fifteenth century as there were several plots to overthrow henry and restore yorkist claimants only two years after the battle of bosworth yorkists rebelled led by john de la pole earl of lincoln who had been named by richard iii as his heir but had been reconciled with henry after bosworth the conspirators produced a pretender to the throne a boy named lambert simnel who bore a close physical resemblance to the young edward earl of warwick son of george of clarence the best surviving male claimant of the house of york this plan was on very shaky ground because the young earl was still alive and in king henrys custody and was paraded through london to expose the impersonation at the battle of stoke field henry defeated lincolns army lincoln died in the battle simnel was pardoned for his part in the rebellion and was sent to work in the royal kitchens henrys throne was again challenged in  with the appearance of the pretender perkin warbeck who claimed he was richard duke of york the younger of the two princes in the tower warbeck made repeated attempts to incite revolts with support at various times from the court of burgundy and james iv of scotland he was captured after the failed second cornish uprising of  and executed in  after attempting to escape from prison during the reign of henry viis son henry viii the possibility of yorkist challenges to the throne remained until as late as  in the persons of edward stafford rd duke of buckingham edmund de la pole rd duke of suffolk and his brother richard de la pole all of whom had blood ties to the yorkist dynasty but were excluded by the prowoodville tudor settlement to an extent englands break with rome was prompted by henrys fears of a disputed succession should he leave only a female heir to the throne or an infant who would be as vulnerable as henry vi had been to antagonistic or rapacious regents aftermathedit historians debate the extent of impact the wars had on medieval english life the classical view is that the many casualties among the nobility continued the changes in feudal english society caused by the effects of the black death these included a weakening of the feudal power of the nobles and an increase in the power of the merchant classes and the growth of a centralised monarchy under the tudors the wars heralded the end of the medieval period in england and the movement towards the renaissance after the wars the large standing baronial armies that had helped fuel the conflict were suppressed henry vii wary of any further fighting kept the barons on a very tight leash removing their right to raise arm and supply armies of retainers so that they could not make war on each other or the king the military power of individual barons declined and the tudor court became a place where baronial squabbles were decided with the influence of the monarch revisionists such as the oxford historian k b mcfarlane suggest that the effects of the conflicts have been greatly exaggerated and that there were no wars of the roses many places were unaffected by the wars particularly in the eastern part of england such as east anglia it has also been suggested that the traumatic impact of the wars was exaggerated by henry vii to magnify his achievement in quelling them and bringing peace the effect of the wars on the merchant and labouring classes was far less than in the long drawnout wars of siege and pillage in europe which were carried out by mercenaries who profited from long wars although there were some lengthy sieges such as those of harlech castle and bamburgh castle these were in comparatively remote and less populous regions in the populated areas both factions had much to lose by the ruin of the country and sought quick resolution of the conflict by pitched battle philippe de commines observed in  the realm of england enjoys one favour above all other realms that neither the countryside nor the people are destroyed nor are buildings burnt or demolished misfortune falls on soldiers and nobles in particular exceptions to this claimed general rule were the lancastrian looting of ludlow after the largely bloodless yorkist defeat at ludford bridge in  and the widespread pillaging carried out by queen margarets unpaid army as it advanced south in early  both events inspired widespread opposition to the queen and support for the yorkists many areas did little or nothing to change their city defences perhaps an indication that they were left untouched by the wars city walls were either left in their ruinous state or only partially rebuilt in the case of london the city was able to avoid being devastated by convincing the york and lancaster armies to stay out after the inability to recreate the defensive city walls few noble houses were extinguished during the wars in the period from  to  before the outbreak of the wars there were as many extinctions of noble lines from natural causes  as occurred during the fighting  from  to  the most ambitious nobles died and by the later period of the wars fewer nobles were prepared to risk their lives and titles in an uncertain strugglecitation needed the kings of france and scotland and the dukes of burgundy played the two factions off against each other pledging military and financial aid and offering asylum to defeated nobles and pretenders to prevent a strong and unified england from making war on them

unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message following defeat in the hundred years war english landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings this is often considered a contributory cause of the wars of the roses the wars were fought largely by the landed aristocracy and armies of feudal retainers with some mercenaries at the end of the hundred years war large numbers of unemployed soldiery returned to england seeking employment in the growing armies of local nobility england drifted toward misrule and violence under the weak governance as local noble families like the nevilles and percies increasingly relied on their feudal retainers to settle disputes it became common practice for landowners to bind their mesnie knights to their service with annual payments half of an indenture contract the randomly cut or indented edge proves a match to the counterpart document edward iii had developed the contract system where the monarch entered into formal written contracts called indenture with experienced captains who were contractually obligated to provide an agreed upon number of men at established rates for a given period frequently the landed nobility acted the principal or main contractor knights men at arms and archers were often subcontracted in addition to professional retainers a lord could find men amongst his tenantry these included landless men and others who would crave the security of maintenance and livery skilled archers could command as high a wage as knights as baronial armies grew in size the rule of law was weakened support for each house largely depended upon dynastic factors such as blood relationships marriages within the nobility and the grants or confiscations of feudal titles and lands given the conflicting loyalties of blood marriage and ambition it was not uncommon for nobles to switch sides several battles such as northampton and bosworth were decided by treacherycitation needed the armies consisted of nobles contingents of menatarms with companies of archers and footsoldiers such as billmen there were also sometimes contingents of foreign mercenaries armed with cannon or handguns the horsemen were generally restricted to prickers and scourers ie scouting and foraging parties the rules of military engagement changed as civil war succeeded overseas campaigns it was customary for the heavy cavalry to fight entirely on foot in several cases noblemen dismounted and fought among the common footsoldiers to inspire them and to dispel the notion that in the case of defeat they might be ransomed while the common soldiers being of little value faced death it was often claimed however that the nobles faced greater risks than the ordinary soldiers as there was little incentive for anyone to take prisoner any highranking noble during or immediately after a battle during the hundred years war against france a captured noble would be able to ransom himself for a large sum but in the wars of the roses a captured noble who belonged to a defeated faction had a high chance of being executed as a traitor for example fortytwo captured knights were executed after the battle of towton the burgundian observer philippe de commines who met edward iv in  reported king edward told me in all the battles which he had won as soon as he had gained victory he mounted his horse and shouted to his men that they must spare the common soldiers and kill the lords of whom none or few escaped even those who escaped execution might be declared attainted and therefore possessing no property and of no value to a captorref chronological list of battlesedit first battle of st albans

main article wars of the roses despite his elevated status richard plantagenet was denied a position in government by the advisers of the weak henry vi particularly john beaufort st duke of somerset and the queen consort margaret of anjou although he served as protector of the realm during henry vis period of incapacity in  his reforms were reversed by somersets party once the king had recovered the wars of the roses began the following year with the first battle of st albans initially richard aimed only to purge his lancastrian political opponents from positions of influence over the king it was not until october  that he claimed the throne for the house of york in that year the yorkists had captured the king at the battle of northampton but victory was shortlived richard and his second son edmund were killed at the battle of wakefield on  december richards claim to the throne was inherited by his son edward with the support of richard neville th earl of warwick the kingmaker edward already showing great promise as a leader of men defeated the lancastrians in a succession of battles while henry vi and margaret of anjou were campaigning in the north warwick gained control of the capital and had edward declared king in london in  edward strengthened his claim with a decisive victory at the battle of towton in the same year in the course of which the lancastrian army was virtually wiped out reigns of the yorkist kingsedit the early reign of edward iv was marred by lancastrian plotting and uprisings in favour of henry vi warwick himself changed sides and supported margaret of anjou and the kings jealous brother george duke of clarence in briefly restoring henry in  however edward regained his throne and the house of lancaster was wiped out with the death of henry vi himself in the tower of london in  in  the continued trouble caused by clarence led to his execution in the tower of london popularly he is thought to have been drowned in a butt of malmsey wine on edwards death in  the crown passed to his twelveyearold son edward edward ivs younger brother richard duke of gloucester was appointed protector and escorted the young king and his brother richard to the tower of london the famous princes in the tower were never seen again however it is unknown whether they were killed or who killed them if it happened parliament declared in the document titulus regius that the two boys were illegitimate on the grounds that edward ivs marriage was invalid and as such richard was heir to the throne he was crowned richard iii in july  defeat of the house of yorkedit richard iii had many enemies though the house of lancaster had been extinguished the lancastrian sympathisers survived who now rallied behind henry tudor a descendant of the beauforts a legitimized branch of the house of lancaster moreover the family of edward iv and the edwardian loyalists were naturally opposed to him essentially dividing his yorkist power base a coup attempt failed in late  but in  richard met henry tudor at the battle of bosworth field during the battle some of richards important supporters switched sides or withheld their retainers from the field richard himself was killed he was the last of the plantagenet kings as well as the last english king to die in battle henry tudor declared himself king took elizabeth of york eldest child of edward iv as his wife symbolically uniting the surviving houses of york and lancaster and acceded to the throne as henry vii founder of the tudor dynasty which reigned until  later claimantsedit see also alternative successions of the english crown the de la pole family were sometimes suggested as heirs to the yorkist cause but henry tudor and his son henry viii of england efficiently suppressed all such opposition another yorkist branch descends from george plantagenet st duke of clarence and younger brother of edward iv the heir to this branch is the earl of loudoun currently simon abneyhastings there was in edward ivs reign a suspicion that this king was illegitimate in  the british station channel  revived the george branchs claim as britains real monarch the earls of loudoun would then at least be the heirs to the yorkists legacyedit upon henry tudors uniting the rival houses of lancaster and york the title duke of york became a royal prerogative and is traditionally accorded to the second son of the reigning monarch beginning with richard of shrewsbury son of edward iv one of the princes in the tower none of its holders were able to transmit it they either died without a male heir or succeeded to the throne the title is held today by prince andrew second son of queen elizabeth ii and her consort prince philip duke of edinburgh the symbol of the house of york was a white rose still used as the badge of yorkshire and jacobitism york pennsylvania is known as the white rose city after the symbol of the house of york the rivalry between york and lancaster in

see also royal badges of england the most popular symbol of the house of york was the white rose of york the yorkist rose is white in colour because in christian liturgical symbolism white is the symbol of light typifying innocence and purity joy and glory during the civil wars of the fifteenth century the white rose was the symbol of yorkist forces opposed to the rival house of lancaster the red rose of lancaster would be a later invention used to represent the house of lancaster but was not in use during the actual conflict the opposition of the two roses gave the wars their name the

infirmity and weak rule of henry vi which revived interest in richard of yorks claim to the throne historians disagree about whether the wars of the roses were caused by the structural problems of bastard feudalism or henry vis ineffectiveness as king with the duke of yorks death the claim transferred to his heir edward who later became the first yorkist king of england as edward iv his son reigned for  days as edward v but parliament then decided that edward and his brother richard were illegitimate and offered the crown to edward ivs younger brother who became richard iii the two young princes disappeared within the confines of the tower of london the final victory went to a claimant of the lancastrian party henry tudor earl of richmond who defeated the last yorkist king richard iii at the battle of bosworth field after assuming the throne as henry vii he married elizabeth of york the eldest daughter and heir of edward iv thereby uniting the two claims the house of tudor ruled

associated with the two royal houses the white rose of york and the red rose of lancaster wars of the roses came into common use in the nineteenth century after the publication in  of anne of geierstein by sir walter scott scott based the name on a scene in william shakespeares play henry vi part  set in the gardens of the temple church where a number of noblemen and a lawyer pick red or white roses to show their loyalty to the lancastrian or yorkist faction respectively the yorkist faction used the symbol of the white rose from early in the conflict but the lancastrian red rose was apparently introduced only after the victory of henry tudor at the battle of bosworth when it was combined with the yorkist white rose to form the tudor rose which symbolised the union of the two houses the origins of the rose as a cognizance itself stem from edward is use of a golden rose stalked proper often owing to nobles holding multiple titles more than one badge was used edward iv for example used both his sun in splendour as earl of march but also his fathers falcon and fetterlock as duke of york badges were not always distinct at the battle of barnet edwards sun was very similar to the earl of oxfords vere star which caused fateful confusion most but not all of the participants in the wars wore livery badges associated with their immediate lords or patrons under the prevailing system of bastard feudalism the wearing of livery was by now confined to those in continuous employ of a lord thus excluding for example mercenaries another example henry tudors forces at bosworth fought under the banner of a red dragon while the yorkist army used richard iiis personal device of a white boar although the names of the rival houses derive from the cities of york and lancaster the corresponding duchies had little to do with these cities the lands and offices attached to the duchy of lancaster were mainly in gloucestershire north wales and cheshire while the estates and castles that were part of the duchy of york were spread throughout england and wales although many were in the welsh marches summary of eventsedit this section does not cite any sources

in the wars of the roses although minor armed clashes had occurred previously between supporters of york and lancaster the first open fighting broke out in  at the first battle of st albans several prominent lancastrians died at the hands of the yorkists although peace was temporarily restored the lancastrians were inspired by margaret of anjou to contest yorks influence and a deadly feud between the two branches of the royal family ensued fighting resumed more violently in  york and his supporters were forced to flee the country but one of his most prominent supporters the earl of warwick invaded england from calais and captured henry vi at the battle of northampton york returned to the country and became protector of england but was dissuaded from claiming the throne margaret and the remaining lancastrian nobles gathered their army in the north of england when york moved north to engage them he and his second son edmund were killed at the battle of wakefield in december  the lancastrian army advanced south and released henry at the second battle of st albans but failed to occupy london and subsequently retreated to the north yorks eldest son edward earl of march was proclaimed king edward iv he gathered the yorkist armies and won a crushing victory at the battle of towton in march  after lancastrian revolts in the north were suppressed in  and henry was captured once again and placed in the tower of london edward fell out with his chief supporter and adviser the earl of warwick known as the kingmaker after edwards unpopular and secretly conducted marriage with the widow of a lancastrian supporter elizabeth woodville within a few years it became clear that edward was favoring his wifes family and alienating a number of friends closely aligned with warwick as well a nearcontemporary flemish picture of the battle of barnet in  furious warwick tried first to supplant edward with his younger brother george duke of clarence establishing the alliance by marriage to his daughter isabel neville when that plan failed due to lack of support from parliament warwick sailed to france with his family and made an alliance with the lancastrian queen margaret of anjou to restore henry vi to the throne this resulted in two years of rapid changes of fortune before edward iv once again won complete victories at barnet april  where warwick was killed and tewkesbury may  where the lancastrian heir edward of westminster prince of wales was killed or perhaps executed after the battle queen margaret was escorted to london as a prisoner and henry was murdered in the tower of london several days later ending the direct lancastrian line of succession a period of comparative peace followed ending with the unexpected death of king edward in  his surviving brother richard duke of gloucester first moved to prevent the unpopular woodville family of edwards widow from participating in the government during the minority of edwards son edward v and then seized the throne for himself using the suspect legitimacy of edward ivs marriage as pretext henry tudor a distant relative of the lancastrian kings who had inherited their claim defeated richard iii at bosworth in  he was crowned henry vii and married elizabeth of york daughter of edward iv to unite and reconcile the two houses yorkist revolts directed by john de la pole st earl of lincoln and others flared up in  under the banner of the pretender lambert simnel—who claimed he was edward earl of warwick son of george of clarence resulting in the last pitched battles though most surviving descendants of richard of york were imprisoned sporadic rebellions continued until  when perkin warbeck who claimed he was the younger brother of edward v one of the two disappeared princes in the tower was imprisoned and later executed origins of the conflictedit disputed successionedit william the conquerors son king henry i of england died in  after his only male heir was killed aboard the white ship following the white ship disaster england entered a period of prolonged instability known as the anarchy however following the ascension of henry ii plantagenet to the throne in  the crown passed from father to son or brother to brother with little difficulty until  henry iv the question of succession after edward iiis death in  is said to be the cause of the wars of roses although edward iii had five legitimate sons there was a sudden narrowing in the direct line of descent near the end of his reign edwards eldest son edward the black prince had died the year before the black princes own eldest son edward of angoulême had died in  edward iii was succeeded on the throne by the black princes younger son richard ii who was only  years old richards claim to the throne was based on the principle that the son of an elder brother had priority in the succession over his uncles since richard was a minor and had three living uncles at the time of edward iiis death there was considerable uncertainty about who was next in line for the succession by custom roger mortimer who claimed descent from king edward through his mother philippa of clarence edward iiis eldest grandchild had the best claim to succeed however a legal decree issued by edward iii in  had introduced some complexity into the question of who would ultimately take the throne the letters patent issued by edward iii limited the right of succession to male heirs which placed richards uncle john of gaunt duke of lancaster and his male descendants ahead of philippas male children in the succession richard iis reign was marked by increasing dissension between the king and several of the most powerful nobles in  he exiled gaunts son henry of bolingbroke richards government had become highly unpopular beyond his strongholds in cheshire and wales and when bolingbroke returned from exile in  initially to reclaim his rights as duke of lancaster he took advantage of the support of most of the nobles to depose richard and was crowned king henry iv establishing the house of lancaster on the throne house of lancasteredit henry v henry ivs claim to the throne was through his father john of gaunt third surviving son of edward iii the childless richard ii had nominated edmund mortimer th earl of march as his successor but there was little support at the time for the counterclaim of the young mortimer as henrys initial popularity waned the mortimer familys claim to the throne was a pretext for the major rebellion of owain glyndŵr in wales and other less successful revolts in cheshire and northumberland there were uprisings in support of the mortimers claim throughout henry ivs reign which lasted until  an important branch of the house of lancaster were the beauforts who were descended from gaunt by his mistress katherine swynford when gaunt and katherine later married their descendants were made legitimate by an act of parliament however henry iv excluded them from the line of succession to the throne henry ivs son and successor henry v inherited a temporarily pacified nation and his military success against france in the hundred years war bolstered his popularity enabling him to strengthen the lancastrian hold on the throne nevertheless one notable conspiracy against henry the southampton plot took place during his nineyear reign this was led by richard earl of cambridge who was executed for treason in  at the start of the campaign that led to the battle of agincourt house of yorkedit the founder of the house of york was edmund of langley the fourth son of edward iii and the younger brother of john of gaunt his son richard earl of cambridge had married anne de mortimer the mortimers were members of the most powerful marcher family of the fourteenth century gm trevelyan has written that the wars of the roses were to a large extent a quarrel between welsh marcer lords who were also great english nobles closely related to the english throne anne herself was descended from edward iii through her mother philippa of clarence daughter of lionel of antwerp edwards second son anne mortimers husband richard earl of cambridge anne had died in  when her brother edmund earl of march who had loyally supported henry died childless in  the title and extensive estates of the earldom of march and the mortimer claim to the throne thus passed to annes descendants richard of york the son of cambridge and anne mortimer was four years old at the time of his fathers execution although cambridge was attainted henry v later allowed richard to inherit the title and lands of cambridges elder brother edward duke of york who had died fighting alongside henry at agincourt and had no issue henry who had three younger brothers and was himself in his prime and recently married to the french princess catherine of valois had no doubt that the lancastrian right to the crown was secure henrys premature death in  at the age of  led to his only son henry vi coming to the throne as an infant and the country being ruled by regents henry vs younger brothers produced no surviving legitimate issue leaving only distant cousins the beauforts as alternative lancaster heirs as richard of york grew into maturity and questions were raised over henry vis fitness to rule richards claim to the throne thus became more significant the revenue from the york and march estates also made him the wealthiest magnate in the land henry viedit from early childhood henry vi was surrounded by quarrelsome councillors and advisors his younger surviving paternal uncle humphrey duke of gloucester sought to be named protector and deliberately courted the popularity of the common people for his own ends but was opposed by cardinal beaufort on several occasions beaufort called on john duke of bedford humphreys older brother to return from his post as regent in france either to mediate or to defend him against humphreys accusations of treason some time after bedford died in  cardinal beaufort withdrew from public affairs partly due to old age and partly because william de la pole st duke of suffolk rose to become the dominant personality at court suffolk was widely held to be enriching himself through his influence on henry and was blamed for mismanaging the government and poorly executing the continuing hundred years war with france under henry vi all the land in france won by henry v and even the provinces of guienne and gascony which had been held since the reign of henry ii three centuries previously were lost henry vi suffolk eventually succeeded in having humphrey of gloucester arrested for treason humphrey died while awaiting trial in prison at bury st edmunds in  some authorities date the start of the war of the roses from the death of humphrey however with severe reverses in france suffolk was stripped of office and was murdered on his way to exile edmund beaufort nd duke of somerset succeeded him as leader of the party seeking peace with france the duke of york who had succeeded bedford as lieutenant in france meanwhile represented those who wished to prosecute the war more vigorously and criticised the court and somerset in particular for starving him of funds and men during his campaigns in france in all these quarrels henry vi had taken little part he was seen as a weak ineffectual king in addition he displayed several symptoms of mental illness that he may have inherited from his maternal grandfather charles vi of france by  many considered henry incapable of carrying out the duties and responsibilities of a king in  there was a violent popular revolt in kent jack cades rebellion which is often seen as the prelude to the wars of the roses the rebel manifesto the complaint of the poor commons of kent was written under cades leadership it accused the crown of extortion perversion of justice and election fraud the rebels occupied parts of london and executed james fiennes st baron saye and sele the unpopular lord high treasurer after a hasty trial after some of them fell to looting they were driven out of london by the citizens they dispersed after they were supposedly pardoned but several including cade were later executed after the rebellion the rebels grievances formed the basis of richard of yorks opposition of a royal government from which he felt excluded two years later in  richard of york returned to england from his new post as lieutenant of ireland and marched on london demanding somersets removal and reform of the government at this stage few of the nobles supported such drastic action and york was forced to submit to superior force at blackheath he was imprisoned for much of  and  but was released after swearing not to take arms against the court the increasing discord at court was mirrored in the country as a whole where noble families engaged in private feuds and showed increasing disrespect for the royal authority and for the courts of law in many cases feuds were fought between oldestablished families and formerly minor nobility raised in power and influence by henry iv in the aftermath of the rebellions against him the quarrel between the percys—long the earls of northumberland—and the comparatively upstart nevilles was the bestknown of these private wars and followed this pattern as did the bonville–courtenay feud in cornwall and devon a factor in these feuds was the presence of large numbers of soldiers discharged from the english armies that had been defeated in france nobles engaged many of these to mount raids or to pack courts of justice with their supporters intimidating suitors witnesses and judges this growing civil discontent the abundance of feuding nobles with private armies and corruption in henry vis court formed a political climate ripe for civil war with the king so easily manipulated power rested with those closest to him at court in other words somerset and the lancastrian faction richard and the yorkist faction who tended to be physically placed further away from the seat of power found their power slowly being stripped away royal power and finances also started to slip as henry was persuaded to grant many royal lands and estates to the lancastrians thereby losing their revenue in  henry suffered the first of several bouts of complete mental collapse during which he failed even to recognise his newborn son edward of westminster on  march  cardinal john kemp the chancellor died henry was incapable of nominating a successor to ensure that the country could be governed a council of regency was set up headed by the duke of york who still remained popular with the people as lord protector york soon asserted his power with evergreater boldness although there is no proof that he had aspirations to the throne at this early stage he imprisoned somerset and backed his neville allies his brotherinlaw the earl of salisbury and salisburys son the earl of warwick in their continuing feud with the earl of northumberland a powerful supporter of henry henry recovered in  and once again fell under the influence of those closest to him at court directed by henrys queen the powerful and aggressive margaret of anjou who emerged as the de facto leader of the lancastrians richard was forced out of court margaret built up an alliance against richard and conspired with other nobles to reduce his influence an increasingly thwarted richard who feared arrest for treason finally resorted to armed hostilities in  start of the waredit the lancastrian siege of london in  is attacked by a yorkist sally richard duke of york led a small force toward london and was met by henrys forces at st albans north of london on  may  the relatively small first battle of st albans was the first open conflict of the civil war richards aim was ostensibly to remove poor advisors from king henrys side the result was a lancastrian defeat several prominent lancastrian leaders including somerset and northumberland were killed after the battle the yorkists found henry hiding in a local tanners shop abandoned by his advisers and servants apparently having suffered another bout of mental illness he had also been slightly wounded in the neck by an arrow york and his allies regained their position of influence with the king indisposed york was again appointed protector and margaret was shunted aside charged with the kings care for a while both sides seemed shocked that an actual battle had been fought and did their best to reconcile their differences but the problems that caused conflict soon reemerged particularly the issue of whether the duke of york or henry and margarets infant son edward would succeed to the throne margaret refused to accept any solution that would disinherit her son and it became clear that she would only tolerate the situation for as long as the duke of york and his allies retained the military ascendancy henry recovered and in february  he relieved york of his office of protector in the autumn of that year henry went on royal progress in the midlands where the king and queen were popular margaret did not allow him to return to london where the merchants were angry at the decline in trade and the widespread disorder the kings court was set up at coventry by then the new duke of somerset was emerging as a favourite of the royal court margaret persuaded henry to revoke the appointments york had made as protector while york was made to return to his post as lieutenant in ireland disorder in the capital and the north of england where fighting between the nevilles and percys had resumed  and piracy by french fleets on the south coast were growing but the king and queen remained intent on protecting their own positions with the queen introducing conscription for the first time in england meanwhile yorks ally warwick later dubbed the kingmaker was growing in popularity in london as the champion of the merchants as captain of calais he had fought piracy in the channel in the spring of  thomas bourchier the archbishop of canterbury attempted to arrange a reconciliation the lords had gathered in london for a grand council and the city was full of armed retainers the archbishop negotiated complex settlements to resolve the bloodfeuds that had persisted since the battle of st albans then on lady day  march the king led a love day procession to st pauls cathedral with lancastrian and yorkist nobles following him hand in hand no sooner had the procession and the council dispersed than plotting resumed act of accordedit ludlow castle south shropshire the next outbreak of fighting was prompted by warwicks highhanded actions as captain of calais he led his ships in attacks on neutral hanseatic league and spanish ships in the channel on flimsy grounds of sovereignty he was summoned to london to face enquiries but he claimed that attempts had been made on his life and returned to calais york salisbury and warwick were summoned to a royal council at coventry but they refused fearing arrest when they were isolated from their own supporters york summoned the nevilles to join him at his stronghold at ludlow castle in the welsh marches on  september  at the battle of blore heath in staffordshire a lancastrian army failed to prevent salisbury from marching from middleham castle in yorkshire to ludlow shortly afterwards the combined yorkist armies confronted the much larger lancastrian force at the battle of ludford bridge warwicks contingent from the garrison of calais under andrew trollope defected to the lancastrians and the yorkist leaders fled york returned to ireland and his eldest son edward earl of march salisbury and warwick fled to calais the lancastrians were back in total control york and his supporters were attainted at the parliament of devils as traitors somerset was appointed governor of calais and was dispatched to take over the vital fortress on the french coast but his attempts to evict warwick were easily repulsed warwick and his supporters even began to launch raids on the english coast from calais adding to the sense of chaos and disorder being attainted only by a successful invasion could the yorkists recover their lands and titles warwick travelled to ireland to concert plans with york evading the royal ships commanded by the duke of exeter in late june  warwick salisbury and edward of march crossed the channel and rapidly established themselves in kent and london where they enjoyed wide support backed by a papal emissary who had taken their side they marched north king henry led an army south to meet them while margaret remained in the north with prince edward at the battle of northampton on  july the yorkist army under warwick defeated the lancastrians aided by treachery in the kings ranks for the second time in the war king henry was found by the yorkists in a tent abandoned by his retinue having apparently suffered another breakdown with the king in their possession the yorkists returned to london in the light of this military success richard of york moved to press his claim to the throne based on the illegitimacy of the lancastrian line landing in north wales he and his wife cecily entered london with all the ceremony usually reserved for a monarch parliament was assembled and when york entered he made straight for the throne which he may have been expecting the lords to encourage him to take for himself as they had acclaimed henry iv in  instead there was stunned silence york announced his claim to the throne but the lords even warwick and salisbury were shocked by his presumption they had no desire at this stage to overthrow king henry their ambition was still limited to the removal of his councillors the next day york produced detailed genealogies to support his claim based on his descent from lionel of antwerp duke of clarence yorks claim was through a daughter of a second son henrys through the son of a third son the judges felt that common law principles could not determine who had priority in the royal succession and declared the matter above the law and passed ther lernyng parliament agreed to consider the matter and accepted that yorks claim was better but by a majority of five they voted that henry vi should remain as king a compromise was struck in october  with the act of accord which recognised york as henrys successor disinheriting henrys sixyearold son edward york accepted this compromise as the best offer it gave him much of what he wanted particularly since he was also made protector of the realm and was able to govern in henrys name death of richard duke of yorkedit ruins of sandal castle near wakefield west yorkshire queen margaret and her son had fled to north wales parts of which were still in lancastrian hands they later travelled by sea to scotland to negotiate for scottish assistance mary of gueldres queen consort to james ii of scotland agreed to give margaret an army on condition that she cede the town of berwick to scotland and marys daughter be betrothed to prince edward margaret agreed although she had no funds to pay her army and could only promise booty from the riches of southern england as long as no looting took place north of the river trent the duke of york left london later that year with the earl of salisbury to consolidate his position in the north against the lancastrians who were reported to be massing near the city of york he took up a defensive position at sandal castle near wakefield over christmas  then on  december his forces left the castle and attacked the lancastrians in the open although outnumbered the ensuing battle of wakefield was a complete lancastrian victory richard of york was slain in the battle and both salisbury and yorks yearold second son edmund earl of rutland were captured and executed margaret ordered the heads of all three placed on the gates of york edwards claim to the throneedit parhelion at sunset the act of accord and the events of wakefield left the yearold edward earl of march yorks eldest son as duke of york and heir to his claim to the throne with an army from the proyorkist marches the border area between england and wales he met jasper tudors lancastrian army arriving from wales and he defeated them soundly at the battle of mortimers cross in herefordshire he inspired his men with a vision of three suns at dawn a phenomenon known as parhelion telling them that it was a portent of victory and represented the three surviving york sons himself george and richard this led to edwards later adoption of the sign of the sunne in splendour as his personal device margarets army was moving south supporting itself by looting as it passed through the prosperous south of england in london warwick used this as propaganda to reinforce yorkist support throughout the south – the town of coventry switched allegiance to the yorkists warwicks army established fortified positions north of the town of st albans to block the main road from the north but was outmanoeuvred by margarets army which swerved to the west and then attacked warwicks positions from behind at the second battle of st albans the lancastrians won another big victory as the yorkist forces fled they left behind king henry who was found unharmed sitting quietly beneath a tree henry knighted thirty lancastrian soldiers immediately after the battle in an illustration of the increasing bitterness of the war queen margaret instructed her sevenyearold son edward of westminster to determine the manner of execution of the yorkist knights who had been charged with keeping henry safe and had stayed at his side throughout the battle as the lancastrian army advanced southwards a wave of dread swept london where rumours were rife about savage northerners intent on plundering the city the people of london shut the city gates and refused to supply food to the queens army which was looting the surrounding counties of hertfordshire and middlesex yorkist triumphedit edward iv edward of march having joined with warwicks surviving forces advanced towards london from the west at the same time that the queen retreated northwards to dunstable as a result edward and warwick were able to enter london with their army they found considerable support there as the city was largely yorkistsupporting it was clear that edward was no longer simply trying to free the king from bad councillors but that his goal was to take the crown thomas kempe the bishop of london asked the people of london their opinion and they replied with shouts of king edward the request was quickly approved by parliament and edward was unofficially crowned in an impromptu ceremony at westminster abbey edward vowed that he would not have a formal coronation until henry vi and his wife were removed from the scene edward claimed henry had forfeited his right to the crown by allowing his queen to take up arms against his rightful heirs under the act of accord parliament had already accepted that edwards victory was simply a restoration of the rightful heir to the throne edward and warwick marched north gathering a large army as they went and met an equally impressive lancastrian army at towton the battle of towton near york was the biggest battle of the wars of the roses both sides agreed beforehand that the issue would be settled that day with no quarter asked or given an estimated – men took part with over  men being killed during and after the battle an enormous number for the time and the greatest recorded single days loss of life on english soil edward and his army won a decisive victory and the lancastrians were routed with most of their leaders slain henry and margaret who were waiting in york with their son edward fled north when they heard the outcome many of the surviving lancastrian nobles switched allegiance to king edward and those who did not were driven back to the northern border areas and a few castles in wales edward advanced to take york where he replaced the rotting heads of his father his brother and salisbury with those of defeated lancastrian lords such as the notorious john clifford th baron de clifford of skiptoncraven who was blamed for the execution of edwards brother edmund earl of rutland after the battle of wakefield edward ivedit harlech castle gwynedd wales the official coronation of edward iv took place in june  in london where he received a rapturous welcome from his supporters after the battle of towton henry vi and margaret had fled to scotland where they stayed with the court of james iii and followed through on their promise to cede berwick to scotland later in the year they mounted an attack on carlisle but lacking money they were easily repulsed by edwards men who were rooting out the remaining lancastrian forces in the northern counties several castles under lancastrian commanders held out for years dunstanburgh alnwick the percy family seat and bamburgh were some of the last to fall there was also some fighting in ireland at the battle of piltown in  the yorkish supporter thomas fitzgerald th earl of desmond defeated the lancastrian butlers of kilkenny the butlers suffered more than  casualties local folklore claims that the battle was so violent that the local river ran red with blood hence the names pill river and piltown baile an phuill meaning town of the blood there were lancastrian revolts in the north of england in  several lancastrian nobles including the third duke of somerset who had apparently been reconciled to edward readily led the rebellion the revolt was put down by warwicks brother john neville a small lancastrian army was destroyed at the battle of hedgeley moor on  april but because neville was escorting scottish commissioners for a treaty to york he could not immediately follow up this victory then on  may he routed somersets army at the battle of hexham somerset was captured and executed the deposed king henry was later captured for the third time at clitheroe in lancashire in  he was taken to london and held prisoner at the tower of london where for the time being he was reasonably well treated about the same time once england under edward iv and scotland had come to terms margaret and her son were forced to leave scotland and sail to france where they maintained an impoverished court in exile for several years the last remaining lancastrian stronghold was harlech castle in wales which surrendered in  after a sevenyearlong siege warwicks rebellion and the death of henry viedit middleham castle the powerful earl of warwick the kingmaker had meanwhile become the greatest landowner in england already a great magnate through his wifes property he had also inherited his fathers estates and had been granted much forfeited lancastrian property he also held many of the offices of state he was convinced of the need for an alliance with france and had been negotiating a match between edward and a french bride however edward had married elizabeth woodville the widow of a lancastrian knight in secret in  he later announced the news of his marriage as fait accompli to warwicks considerable embarrassment this embarrassment turned to bitterness when the woodvilles came to be favoured over the nevilles at court many of queen elizabeths relatives were married into noble families and others were granted peerages or royal offices other factors compounded warwicks disillusionment edwards preference for an alliance with burgundy rather than france and reluctance to allow his brothers george duke of clarence and richard duke of gloucester to marry warwicks daughters isabel and anne furthermore edwards general popularity was on the wane in this period with higher taxes and persistent disruptions of law and order louis xi of france by  warwick had formed an alliance with edwards jealous and treacherous brother george who married isabel neville in defiance of edwards wishes in calais they raised an army that defeated the kings forces at the battle of edgecote moor edward was captured at olney buckinghamshire and imprisoned at middleham castle in yorkshire warwick briefly had two kings of england in his custody warwick had the queens father richard woodville st earl rivers and her brother john executed however he made no immediate move to have edward declared illegitimate and place george on the throne the country was in turmoil with nobles once again settling scores with private armies in episodes such as the battle of nibley green and lancastrians being encouraged to rebel few of the nobles were prepared to support warwicks seizure of power edward was escorted to london by warwicks brother george neville the archbishop of york where he and warwick were reconciled to outward appearances when further rebellions broke out in lincolnshire edward easily suppressed them at the battle of losecoat field from the testimony of the captured leaders he declared that warwick and george duke of clarence had instigated them they were declared traitors and forced to flee to france where margaret of anjou was already in exile louis xi of france who wished to forestall a hostile alliance between edward and edwards brotherinlaw charles the bold duke of burgundy suggested the idea of an alliance between warwick and margaret neither of those two formerly mortal enemies entertained the notion at first but eventually they were brought round to realise the potential benefits however both were undoubtedly hoping for different outcomes warwick for a puppet king in the form of henry vi or his young son margaret to be able to reclaim her familys realm in any case a marriage was arranged between warwicks daughter anne and margarets son edward of westminster and warwick invaded england in the autumn of  battle of tewkesbury edward iv had already marched north to suppress another uprising in yorkshire warwick with help from a fleet under his nephew the bastard of fauconberg landed at dartmouth and rapidly secured support from the southern counties and ports he occupied london in october and paraded henry vi through the streets as the restored king warwicks brother john neville who had recently received the empty title marquess of montagu and who led large armies in the scottish marches suddenly defected to warwick edward was unprepared for this event and had to order his army to scatter he and richard duke of gloucester fled from doncaster to the coast and thence to holland and exile in burgundy they were proclaimed traitors and many exiled lancastrians returned to reclaim their estates warwicks success was shortlived however he overreached himself with his plan to invade burgundy in alliance with the king of france tempted by king louis promise of territory in the netherlands as a reward this led edwards brotherinlaw charles of burgundy to provide funds and troops to edward to enable him to launch an invasion of england in  edward landed with a small force at ravenspur on the yorkshire coast initially claiming to support henry and to be seeking only to have his title of duke of york restored he soon gained the city of york and rallied several supporters his brother george turned traitor again abandoning warwick having outmaneuvered warwick and montagu edward captured london his army then met warwicks at the battle of barnet the battle was fought in thick fog and some of warwicks men attacked each other by mistake it was believed by all that they had been betrayed and warwicks army fled warwick was cut down trying to reach his horse montagu was also killed in the battle margaret and her son edward had landed in the west country only a few days before the battle of barnet rather than return to france margaret sought to join the lancastrian supporters in wales and marched to cross the severn but was thwarted when the city of gloucester refused her passage across the river her army commanded by the fourth successive duke of somerset was brought to battle and destroyed at the battle of tewkesbury her son prince edward the lancastrian heir to the throne was killed with no heirs to succeed him henry vi was murdered shortly afterwards on  may  to strengthen the yorkist hold on the throne richard iiiedit richard iii the restoration of edward iv in  is sometimes seen as marking the end of the wars of the roses proper peace was restored for the remainder of edwards reign his youngest brother richard duke of gloucester and edwards lifelong companion and supporter william hastings were generously rewarded for their loyalty becoming effectively governors of the north and midlands respectively george of clarence became increasingly estranged from edward and was executed in  for association with convicted traitors when edward died suddenly in  political and dynastic turmoil erupted again many of the nobles still resented the influence of the queens woodville relatives her brother anthony woodville nd earl rivers and her son by her first marriage thomas grey st marquess of dorset and regarded them as powerhungry upstarts parvenus at the time of edwards premature death his heir edward v was only  years old and had been brought up under the stewardship of earl rivers at ludlow castle on his deathbed edward had named his surviving brother richard of gloucester as protector of england richard had been in the north when edward died hastings who also held the office of lord chamberlain sent word to him to bring a strong force to london to counter any force the woodvilles might muster the duke of buckingham also declared his support for richard richard and buckingham overtook earl rivers who was escorting the young edward v to london at stony stratford in buckinghamshire on  april although they dined with rivers amicably they took him prisoner the next day and declared to edward that they had done so to forestall a conspiracy by the woodvilles against his life rivers and his nephew richard grey were sent to pontefract castle in yorkshire and executed there at the end of june princes in the tower painted by john everett millais edward entered london in the custody of richard on  may and was lodged in the tower of london elizabeth woodville had already gone hastily into sanctuary at westminster with her remaining children although preparations were being made for edward v to be crowned on  june at which point richards authority as protector would end on  june richard held a full meeting of the council at which he accused hastings and others of conspiracy against him hastings was executed without trial later in the day thomas bourchier the archbishop of canterbury then persuaded elizabeth woodville to allow her younger son the yearold richard duke of york to join edward in the tower having secured the boys robert stillington bishop of bath and wells then alleged that edward ivs marriage to elizabeth woodville had been illegal and that the two boys were therefore illegitimate parliament agreed and enacted the titulus regius which officially named gloucester as king richard iii the two imprisoned boys known as the princes in the tower disappeared and were possibly murdered by whom and under whose orders remains controversial there was never a trial or judicial inquest on the matter perkin warbeck claimed he was the younger of the princes from  and was recognised as such in international diplomacy outside england having been crowned in a lavish ceremony on  july richard then proceeded on a tour of the midlands and the north of england dispensing generous bounties and charters and naming his own son as the prince of wales buckinghams revoltedit for more details on this topic see buckinghams rebellion opposition to richards rule had already begun in the south when on  october the duke of buckingham who had been instrumental in placing richard on the throne and who himself had a distant claim to the crown led a revolt aimed at installing the lancastrian henry tudor it has been argued that his supporting tudor rather than either edward v or his younger brother showed buckingham was aware that both were already dead the lancastrian claim to the throne had descended to henry tudor on the death of henry vi and his son in  henrys father edmund tudor st earl of richmond had been a halfbrother of henry vi but henrys claim to royalty was through his mother margaret beaufort she was descended from john beaufort who was a son of john of gaunt and thus a grandson of edward iii john beaufort had been illegitimate at birth though later legitimised by the marriage of his parents it had supposedly been a condition of the legitimation that the beaufort descendants forfeited their rights to the crown henry had spent much of his childhood under siege in harlech castle or in exile in brittany after  edward iv had preferred to belittle henrys pretensions to the crown and made only sporadic attempts to secure him however his mother margaret beaufort had been twice remarried first to buckinghams uncle and then to thomas lord stanley one of edwards principal officers and continually promoted her sons rights buckinghams rebellion failed some of his supporters in the south rose up prematurely thus allowing richards lieutenant in the south the duke of norfolk to prevent many rebels from joining forces buckingham himself raised a force at brecon in midwales he was prevented from crossing the river severn to join other rebels in the south of england by storms and floods which also prevented henry tudor landing in the west country buckinghams starving forces deserted and he was betrayed and executed the failure of buckinghams revolt was clearly not the end of the plots against richard who could never again feel secure and who also suffered the loss of his wife and elevenyearold son putting the future of the yorkist dynasty in doubt henry viiedit henry vii many of buckinghams defeated supporters and other disaffected nobles fled to join henry tudor in exile richard made an attempt to bribe the duke of brittanys chief minister pierre landais to betray henry but henry was warned and escaped to france where he was again given sanctuary and aid confident that many magnates and even many of richards officers would join him henry set sail from harfleur on  august  with a force of exiles and french mercenaries with fair winds he landed in pembrokeshire six days later the officers richard had appointed in wales either joined henry or stood aside henry gathered supporters on his march through wales and the welsh marches and defeated richard at the battle of bosworth field richard was slain during the battle supposedly by the major welsh landowner rhys ap thomas with a blow to the head from his poleaxe rhys was knighted three days later by henry vii henry having been acclaimed king henry vii then strengthened his position by marrying elizabeth of york daughter of edward iv and the best surviving yorkist claimant he thus reunited the two royal houses merging the rival symbols of the red rose of lancaster and the white rose of york into the new emblem of the red and white tudor rose henry shored up his position by executing all other possible claimants whenever any excuse was offered a policy his son henry viii continued many historians consider the accession of henry vii to mark the end of the wars of the roses others argue that they continued to the end of the fifteenth century as there were several plots to overthrow henry and restore yorkist claimants only two years after the battle of bosworth yorkists rebelled led by john de la pole earl of lincoln who had been named by richard iii as his heir but had been reconciled with henry after bosworth the conspirators produced a pretender to the throne a boy named lambert simnel who bore a close physical resemblance to the young edward earl of warwick son of george of clarence the best surviving male claimant of the house of york this plan was on very shaky ground because the young earl was still alive and in king henrys custody and was paraded through london to expose the impersonation at the battle of stoke field henry defeated lincolns army lincoln died in the battle simnel was pardoned for his part in the rebellion and was sent to work in the royal kitchens henrys throne was again challenged in  with the appearance of the pretender perkin warbeck who claimed he was richard duke of york the younger of the two princes in the tower warbeck made repeated attempts to incite revolts with support at various times from the court of burgundy and james iv of scotland he was captured after the failed second cornish uprising of  and executed in  after attempting to escape from prison during the reign of henry viis son henry viii the possibility of yorkist challenges to the throne remained until as late as  in the persons of edward stafford rd duke of buckingham edmund de la pole rd duke of suffolk and his brother richard de la pole all of whom had blood ties to the yorkist dynasty but were excluded by the prowoodville tudor settlement to an extent englands break with rome was prompted by henrys fears of a disputed succession should he leave only a female heir to the throne or an infant who would be as vulnerable as henry vi had been to antagonistic or rapacious regents aftermathedit historians debate the extent of impact the wars had on medieval english life the classical view is that the many casualties among the nobility continued the changes in feudal english society caused by the effects of the black death these included a weakening of the feudal power of the nobles and an increase in the power of the merchant classes and the growth of a centralised monarchy under the tudors the wars heralded the end of the medieval period in england and the movement towards the renaissance after the wars the large standing baronial armies that had helped fuel the conflict were suppressed henry vii wary of any further fighting kept the barons on a very tight leash removing their right to raise arm and supply armies of retainers so that they could not make war on each other or the king the military power of individual barons declined and the tudor court became a place where baronial squabbles were decided with the influence of the monarch revisionists such as the oxford historian k b mcfarlane suggest that the effects of the conflicts have been greatly exaggerated and that there were no wars of the roses many places were unaffected by the wars particularly in the eastern part of england such as east anglia it has also been suggested that the traumatic impact of the wars was exaggerated by henry vii to magnify his achievement in quelling them and bringing peace the effect of the wars on the merchant and labouring classes was far less than in the long drawnout wars of siege and pillage in europe which were carried out by mercenaries who profited from long wars although there were some lengthy sieges such as those of harlech castle and bamburgh castle these were in comparatively remote and less populous regions in the populated areas both factions had much to lose by the ruin of the country and sought quick resolution of the conflict by pitched battle philippe de commines observed in  the realm of england enjoys one favour above all other realms that neither the countryside nor the people are destroyed nor are buildings burnt or demolished misfortune falls on soldiers and nobles in particular exceptions to this claimed general rule were the lancastrian looting of ludlow after the largely bloodless yorkist defeat at ludford bridge in  and the widespread pillaging carried out by queen margarets unpaid army as it advanced south in early  both events inspired widespread opposition to the queen and support for the yorkists many areas did little or nothing to change their city defences perhaps an indication that they were left untouched by the wars city walls were either left in their ruinous state or only partially rebuilt in the case of london the city was able to avoid being devastated by convincing the york and lancaster armies to stay out after the inability to recreate the defensive city walls few noble houses were extinguished during the wars in the period from  to  before the outbreak of the wars there were as many extinctions of noble lines from natural causes  as occurred during the fighting  from  to  the most ambitious nobles died and by the later period of the wars fewer nobles were prepared to risk their lives and titles in an uncertain strugglecitation needed the kings of france and scotland and the dukes of burgundy played the two factions off against each other pledging military and financial aid and offering asylum to defeated nobles and pretenders to prevent a strong and unified england from making war on them

unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message following defeat in the hundred years war english landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings this is often considered a contributory cause of the wars of the roses the wars were fought largely by the landed aristocracy and armies of feudal retainers with some mercenaries at the end of the hundred years war large numbers of unemployed soldiery returned to england seeking employment in the growing armies of local nobility england drifted toward misrule and violence under the weak governance as local noble families like the nevilles and percies increasingly relied on their feudal retainers to settle disputes it became common practice for landowners to bind their mesnie knights to their service with annual payments half of an indenture contract the randomly cut or indented edge proves a match to the counterpart document edward iii had developed the contract system where the monarch entered into formal written contracts called indenture with experienced captains who were contractually obligated to provide an agreed upon number of men at established rates for a given period frequently the landed nobility acted the principal or main contractor knights men at arms and archers were often subcontracted in addition to professional retainers a lord could find men amongst his tenantry these included landless men and others who would crave the security of maintenance and livery skilled archers could command as high a wage as knights as baronial armies grew in size the rule of law was weakened support for each house largely depended upon dynastic factors such as blood relationships marriages within the nobility and the grants or confiscations of feudal titles and lands given the conflicting loyalties of blood marriage and ambition it was not uncommon for nobles to switch sides several battles such as northampton and bosworth were decided by treacherycitation needed the armies consisted of nobles contingents of menatarms with companies of archers and footsoldiers such as billmen there were also sometimes contingents of foreign mercenaries armed with cannon or handguns the horsemen were generally restricted to prickers and scourers ie scouting and foraging parties the rules of military engagement changed as civil war succeeded overseas campaigns it was customary for the heavy cavalry to fight entirely on foot in several cases noblemen dismounted and fought among the common footsoldiers to inspire them and to dispel the notion that in the case of defeat they might be ransomed while the common soldiers being of little value faced death it was often claimed however that the nobles faced greater risks than the ordinary soldiers as there was little incentive for anyone to take prisoner any highranking noble during or immediately after a battle during the hundred years war against france a captured noble would be able to ransom himself for a large sum but in the wars of the roses a captured noble who belonged to a defeated faction had a high chance of being executed as a traitor for example fortytwo captured knights were executed after the battle of towton the burgundian observer philippe de commines who met edward iv in  reported king edward told me in all the battles which he had won as soon as he had gained victory he mounted his horse and shouted to his men that they must spare the common soldiers and kill the lords of whom none or few escaped even those who escaped execution might be declared attainted and therefore possessing no property and of no value to a captorref chronological list of battlesedit first battle of st albans

virtually wiped out reigns of the yorkist kingsedit the early reign of edward iv was marred by lancastrian plotting and uprisings in favour of henry vi warwick himself changed sides and supported margaret of anjou and the kings jealous brother george duke of clarence in briefly restoring henry in  however edward regained his throne and the house of lancaster was wiped out with the death of henry vi himself in the tower of london in  in  the continued trouble caused by clarence led to his execution in the tower of london popularly he is thought to have been drowned in a butt of malmsey wine on edwards death in  the crown passed to his twelveyearold son edward edward ivs younger brother richard duke of gloucester was appointed protector and escorted the young king and his brother richard to the tower of london the famous princes in the tower were never seen again however it is unknown whether they were killed or who killed them if it happened parliament declared in the document titulus regius that the two boys were illegitimate on the grounds that edward ivs marriage was invalid and as such richard was heir to the throne he was crowned richard iii in july  defeat of the house of yorkedit richard iii had many enemies though the house of lancaster had been extinguished the lancastrian sympathisers survived who now rallied behind henry tudor a descendant of the beauforts a legitimized branch of the house of lancaster moreover the family of edward iv and the edwardian loyalists were naturally opposed to him essentially dividing his yorkist power base a coup attempt failed in late  but in  richard met henry tudor at the battle of bosworth field during the battle some of richards important supporters switched sides or withheld their retainers from the field richard himself was killed he was the last of the plantagenet kings as well as the last english king to die in battle henry tudor declared himself king took elizabeth of york eldest child of edward iv as his wife symbolically uniting the surviving houses of york and lancaster and acceded to the throne as henry vii founder of the tudor dynasty which reigned until  later claimantsedit see also alternative successions of the english crown the de la pole family were sometimes suggested as heirs to the yorkist cause but henry tudor and his son henry viii of england efficiently suppressed all such opposition another yorkist branch descends from george plantagenet st duke of clarence and younger brother of edward iv the heir to this branch is the earl of loudoun currently simon abneyhastings there was in edward ivs reign a suspicion that this king was illegitimate in  the british station channel  revived the george branchs claim as britains real monarch the earls of loudoun would then at least be the heirs to the yorkists legacyedit upon henry tudors uniting the rival houses of lancaster and york the title duke of york became a royal prerogative and is traditionally accorded to the second son of the reigning monarch beginning with richard of shrewsbury son of edward iv one of the princes in the tower none of its holders were able to transmit it they either died without a male heir or succeeded to the throne the title is held today by prince andrew second son of queen elizabeth ii and her consort prince philip duke of edinburgh the symbol of the house of york was a white rose still used as the badge of yorkshire and jacobitism york pennsylvania is known as the white rose city after the symbol of the house of york the rivalry between york and lancaster in

see also royal badges of england the most popular symbol of the house of york was the white rose of york the yorkist rose is white in colour because in christian liturgical symbolism white is the symbol of light typifying innocence and purity joy and glory during the civil wars of the fifteenth century the white rose was the symbol of yorkist forces opposed to the rival house of lancaster the red rose of lancaster would be a later invention used to represent the house of lancaster but was not in use during the actual conflict the opposition of the two roses gave the wars their name the

losecoat field barnet tewkesbury bosworth field stoke field the wars of the roses were a series of wars for control of the throne of england fought between supporters of two rival branches of the royal house of plantagenet the house of lancaster associated with a red rose and the house of york whose symbol was a white rose the conflict lasted through many sporadic episodes between  and  however there was fighting before and after this period between the houses the power struggle ignited around social and financial troubles following the hundred years war combined with the mental infirmity and weak rule of henry vi which revived interest in richard of yorks claim to the throne historians disagree about whether the wars of the roses were caused by the structural problems of bastard feudalism or henry vis ineffectiveness as king with the duke of yorks death the claim transferred to his heir edward who later became the first yorkist king of england as edward iv his son reigned for  days as edward v but parliament then decided that edward and his brother richard were illegitimate and offered the crown to edward ivs younger brother who became richard iii the two young princes disappeared within the confines of the tower of london the final victory went to a claimant of the lancastrian party henry tudor earl of richmond who defeated the last yorkist king richard iii at the battle of bosworth field after assuming the throne as henry vii he married elizabeth of york the eldest daughter and heir of edward iv thereby uniting the two claims the house of tudor ruled

associated with the two royal houses the white rose of york and the red rose of lancaster wars of the roses came into common use in the nineteenth century after the publication in  of anne of geierstein by sir walter scott scott based the name on a scene in william shakespeares play henry vi part  set in the gardens of the temple church where a number of noblemen and a lawyer pick red or white roses to show their loyalty to the lancastrian or yorkist faction respectively the yorkist faction used the symbol of the white rose from early in the conflict but the lancastrian red rose was apparently introduced only after the victory of henry tudor at the battle of bosworth when it was combined with the yorkist white rose to form the tudor rose which symbolised the union of the two houses the origins of the rose as a cognizance itself stem from edward is use of a golden rose stalked proper often owing to nobles holding multiple titles more than one badge was used edward iv for example used both his sun in splendour as earl of march but also his fathers falcon and fetterlock as duke of york badges were not always distinct at the battle of barnet edwards sun was very similar to the earl of oxfords vere star which caused fateful confusion most but not all of the participants in the wars wore livery badges associated with their immediate lords or patrons under the prevailing system of bastard feudalism the wearing of livery was by now confined to those in continuous employ of a lord thus excluding for example mercenaries another example henry tudors forces at bosworth fought under the banner of a red dragon while the yorkist army used richard iiis personal device of a white boar although the names of the rival houses derive from the cities of york and lancaster the corresponding duchies had little to do with these cities the lands and offices attached to the duchy of lancaster were mainly in gloucestershire north wales and cheshire while the estates and castles that were part of the duchy of york were spread throughout england and wales although many were in the welsh marches summary of eventsedit this section does not cite any sources

in the wars of the roses although minor armed clashes had occurred previously between supporters of york and lancaster the first open fighting broke out in  at the first battle of st albans several prominent lancastrians died at the hands of the yorkists although peace was temporarily restored the lancastrians were inspired by margaret of anjou to contest yorks influence and a deadly feud between the two branches of the royal family ensued fighting resumed more violently in  york and his supporters were forced to flee the country but one of his most prominent supporters the earl of warwick invaded england from calais and captured henry vi at the battle of northampton york returned to the country and became protector of england but was dissuaded from claiming the throne margaret and the remaining lancastrian nobles gathered their army in the north of england when york moved north to engage them he and his second son edmund were killed at the battle of wakefield in december  the lancastrian army advanced south and released henry at the second battle of st albans but failed to occupy london and subsequently retreated to the north yorks eldest son edward earl of march was proclaimed king edward iv he gathered the yorkist armies and won a crushing victory at the battle of towton in march  after lancastrian revolts in the north were suppressed in  and henry was captured once again and placed in the tower of london edward fell out with his chief supporter and adviser the earl of warwick known as the kingmaker after edwards unpopular and secretly conducted marriage with the widow of a lancastrian supporter elizabeth woodville within a few years it became clear that edward was favoring his wifes family and alienating a number of friends closely aligned with warwick as well a nearcontemporary flemish picture of the battle of barnet in  furious warwick tried first to supplant edward with his younger brother george duke of clarence establishing the alliance by marriage to his daughter isabel neville when that plan failed due to lack of support from parliament warwick sailed to france with his family and made an alliance with the lancastrian queen margaret of anjou to restore henry vi to the throne this resulted in two years of rapid changes of fortune before edward iv once again won complete victories at barnet april  where warwick was killed and tewkesbury may  where the lancastrian heir edward of westminster prince of wales was killed or perhaps executed after the battle queen margaret was escorted to london as a prisoner and henry was murdered in the tower of london several days later ending the direct lancastrian line of succession a period of comparative peace followed ending with the unexpected death of king edward in  his surviving brother richard duke of gloucester first moved to prevent the unpopular woodville family of edwards widow from participating in the government during the minority of edwards son edward v and then seized the throne for himself using the suspect legitimacy of edward ivs marriage as pretext henry tudor a distant relative of the lancastrian kings who had inherited their claim defeated richard iii at bosworth in  he was crowned henry vii and married elizabeth of york daughter of edward iv to unite and reconcile the two houses yorkist revolts directed by john de la pole st earl of lincoln and others flared up in  under the banner of the pretender lambert simnel—who claimed he was edward earl of warwick son of george of clarence resulting in the last pitched battles though most surviving descendants of richard of york were imprisoned sporadic rebellions continued until  when perkin warbeck who claimed he was the younger brother of edward v one of the two disappeared princes in the tower was imprisoned and later executed origins of the conflictedit disputed successionedit william the conquerors son king henry i of england died in  after his only male heir was killed aboard the white ship following the white ship disaster england entered a period of prolonged instability known as the anarchy however following the ascension of henry ii plantagenet to the throne in  the crown passed from father to son or brother to brother with little difficulty until  henry iv the question of succession after edward iiis death in  is said to be the cause of the wars of roses although edward iii had five legitimate sons there was a sudden narrowing in the direct line of descent near the end of his reign edwards eldest son edward the black prince had died the year before the black princes own eldest son edward of angoulême had died in  edward iii was succeeded on the throne by the black princes younger son richard ii who was only  years old richards claim to the throne was based on the principle that the son of an elder brother had priority in the succession over his uncles since richard was a minor and had three living uncles at the time of edward iiis death there was considerable uncertainty about who was next in line for the succession by custom roger mortimer who claimed descent from king edward through his mother philippa of clarence edward iiis eldest grandchild had the best claim to succeed however a legal decree issued by edward iii in  had introduced some complexity into the question of who would ultimately take the throne the letters patent issued by edward iii limited the right of succession to male heirs which placed richards uncle john of gaunt duke of lancaster and his male descendants ahead of philippas male children in the succession richard iis reign was marked by increasing dissension between the king and several of the most powerful nobles in  he exiled gaunts son henry of bolingbroke richards government had become highly unpopular beyond his strongholds in cheshire and wales and when bolingbroke returned from exile in  initially to reclaim his rights as duke of lancaster he took advantage of the support of most of the nobles to depose richard and was crowned king henry iv establishing the house of lancaster on the throne house of lancasteredit henry v henry ivs claim to the throne was through his father john of gaunt third surviving son of edward iii the childless richard ii had nominated edmund mortimer th earl of march as his successor but there was little support at the time for the counterclaim of the young mortimer as henrys initial popularity waned the mortimer familys claim to the throne was a pretext for the major rebellion of owain glyndŵr in wales and other less successful revolts in cheshire and northumberland there were uprisings in support of the mortimers claim throughout henry ivs reign which lasted until  an important branch of the house of lancaster were the beauforts who were descended from gaunt by his mistress katherine swynford when gaunt and katherine later married their descendants were made legitimate by an act of parliament however henry iv excluded them from the line of succession to the throne henry ivs son and successor henry v inherited a temporarily pacified nation and his military success against france in the hundred years war bolstered his popularity enabling him to strengthen the lancastrian hold on the throne nevertheless one notable conspiracy against henry the southampton plot took place during his nineyear reign this was led by richard earl of cambridge who was executed for treason in  at the start of the campaign that led to the battle of agincourt house of yorkedit the founder of the house of york was edmund of langley the fourth son of edward iii and the younger brother of john of gaunt his son richard earl of cambridge had married anne de mortimer the mortimers were members of the most powerful marcher family of the fourteenth century gm trevelyan has written that the wars of the roses were to a large extent a quarrel between welsh marcer lords who were also great english nobles closely related to the english throne anne herself was descended from edward iii through her mother philippa of clarence daughter of lionel of antwerp edwards second son anne mortimers husband richard earl of cambridge anne had died in  when her brother edmund earl of march who had loyally supported henry died childless in  the title and extensive estates of the earldom of march and the mortimer claim to the throne thus passed to annes descendants richard of york the son of cambridge and anne mortimer was four years old at the time of his fathers execution although cambridge was attainted henry v later allowed richard to inherit the title and lands of cambridges elder brother edward duke of york who had died fighting alongside henry at agincourt and had no issue henry who had three younger brothers and was himself in his prime and recently married to the french princess catherine of valois had no doubt that the lancastrian right to the crown was secure henrys premature death in  at the age of  led to his only son henry vi coming to the throne as an infant and the country being ruled by regents henry vs younger brothers produced no surviving legitimate issue leaving only distant cousins the beauforts as alternative lancaster heirs as richard of york grew into maturity and questions were raised over henry vis fitness to rule richards claim to the throne thus became more significant the revenue from the york and march estates also made him the wealthiest magnate in the land henry viedit from early childhood henry vi was surrounded by quarrelsome councillors and advisors his younger surviving paternal uncle humphrey duke of gloucester sought to be named protector and deliberately courted the popularity of the common people for his own ends but was opposed by cardinal beaufort on several occasions beaufort called on john duke of bedford humphreys older brother to return from his post as regent in france either to mediate or to defend him against humphreys accusations of treason some time after bedford died in  cardinal beaufort withdrew from public affairs partly due to old age and partly because william de la pole st duke of suffolk rose to become the dominant personality at court suffolk was widely held to be enriching himself through his influence on henry and was blamed for mismanaging the government and poorly executing the continuing hundred years war with france under henry vi all the land in france won by henry v and even the provinces of guienne and gascony which had been held since the reign of henry ii three centuries previously were lost henry vi suffolk eventually succeeded in having humphrey of gloucester arrested for treason humphrey died while awaiting trial in prison at bury st edmunds in  some authorities date the start of the war of the roses from the death of humphrey however with severe reverses in france suffolk was stripped of office and was murdered on his way to exile edmund beaufort nd duke of somerset succeeded him as leader of the party seeking peace with france the duke of york who had succeeded bedford as lieutenant in france meanwhile represented those who wished to prosecute the war more vigorously and criticised the court and somerset in particular for starving him of funds and men during his campaigns in france in all these quarrels henry vi had taken little part he was seen as a weak ineffectual king in addition he displayed several symptoms of mental illness that he may have inherited from his maternal grandfather charles vi of france by  many considered henry incapable of carrying out the duties and responsibilities of a king in  there was a violent popular revolt in kent jack cades rebellion which is often seen as the prelude to the wars of the roses the rebel manifesto the complaint of the poor commons of kent was written under cades leadership it accused the crown of extortion perversion of justice and election fraud the rebels occupied parts of london and executed james fiennes st baron saye and sele the unpopular lord high treasurer after a hasty trial after some of them fell to looting they were driven out of london by the citizens they dispersed after they were supposedly pardoned but several including cade were later executed after the rebellion the rebels grievances formed the basis of richard of yorks opposition of a royal government from which he felt excluded two years later in  richard of york returned to england from his new post as lieutenant of ireland and marched on london demanding somersets removal and reform of the government at this stage few of the nobles supported such drastic action and york was forced to submit to superior force at blackheath he was imprisoned for much of  and  but was released after swearing not to take arms against the court the increasing discord at court was mirrored in the country as a whole where noble families engaged in private feuds and showed increasing disrespect for the royal authority and for the courts of law in many cases feuds were fought between oldestablished families and formerly minor nobility raised in power and influence by henry iv in the aftermath of the rebellions against him the quarrel between the percys—long the earls of northumberland—and the comparatively upstart nevilles was the bestknown of these private wars and followed this pattern as did the bonville–courtenay feud in cornwall and devon a factor in these feuds was the presence of large numbers of soldiers discharged from the english armies that had been defeated in france nobles engaged many of these to mount raids or to pack courts of justice with their supporters intimidating suitors witnesses and judges this growing civil discontent the abundance of feuding nobles with private armies and corruption in henry vis court formed a political climate ripe for civil war with the king so easily manipulated power rested with those closest to him at court in other words somerset and the lancastrian faction richard and the yorkist faction who tended to be physically placed further away from the seat of power found their power slowly being stripped away royal power and finances also started to slip as henry was persuaded to grant many royal lands and estates to the lancastrians thereby losing their revenue in  henry suffered the first of several bouts of complete mental collapse during which he failed even to recognise his newborn son edward of westminster on  march  cardinal john kemp the chancellor died henry was incapable of nominating a successor to ensure that the country could be governed a council of regency was set up headed by the duke of york who still remained popular with the people as lord protector york soon asserted his power with evergreater boldness although there is no proof that he had aspirations to the throne at this early stage he imprisoned somerset and backed his neville allies his brotherinlaw the earl of salisbury and salisburys son the earl of warwick in their continuing feud with the earl of northumberland a powerful supporter of henry henry recovered in  and once again fell under the influence of those closest to him at court directed by henrys queen the powerful and aggressive margaret of anjou who emerged as the de facto leader of the lancastrians richard was forced out of court margaret built up an alliance against richard and conspired with other nobles to reduce his influence an increasingly thwarted richard who feared arrest for treason finally resorted to armed hostilities in  start of the waredit the lancastrian siege of london in  is attacked by a yorkist sally richard duke of york led a small force toward london and was met by henrys forces at st albans north of london on  may  the relatively small first battle of st albans was the first open conflict of the civil war richards aim was ostensibly to remove poor advisors from king henrys side the result was a lancastrian defeat several prominent lancastrian leaders including somerset and northumberland were killed after the battle the yorkists found henry hiding in a local tanners shop abandoned by his advisers and servants apparently having suffered another bout of mental illness he had also been slightly wounded in the neck by an arrow york and his allies regained their position of influence with the king indisposed york was again appointed protector and margaret was shunted aside charged with the kings care for a while both sides seemed shocked that an actual battle had been fought and did their best to reconcile their differences but the problems that caused conflict soon reemerged particularly the issue of whether the duke of york or henry and margarets infant son edward would succeed to the throne margaret refused to accept any solution that would disinherit her son and it became clear that she would only tolerate the situation for as long as the duke of york and his allies retained the military ascendancy henry recovered and in february  he relieved york of his office of protector in the autumn of that year henry went on royal progress in the midlands where the king and queen were popular margaret did not allow him to return to london where the merchants were angry at the decline in trade and the widespread disorder the kings court was set up at coventry by then the new duke of somerset was emerging as a favourite of the royal court margaret persuaded henry to revoke the appointments york had made as protector while york was made to return to his post as lieutenant in ireland disorder in the capital and the north of england where fighting between the nevilles and percys had resumed  and piracy by french fleets on the south coast were growing but the king and queen remained intent on protecting their own positions with the queen introducing conscription for the first time in england meanwhile yorks ally warwick later dubbed the kingmaker was growing in popularity in london as the champion of the merchants as captain of calais he had fought piracy in the channel in the spring of  thomas bourchier the archbishop of canterbury attempted to arrange a reconciliation the lords had gathered in london for a grand council and the city was full of armed retainers the archbishop negotiated complex settlements to resolve the bloodfeuds that had persisted since the battle of st albans then on lady day  march the king led a love day procession to st pauls cathedral with lancastrian and yorkist nobles following him hand in hand no sooner had the procession and the council dispersed than plotting resumed act of accordedit ludlow castle south shropshire the next outbreak of fighting was prompted by warwicks highhanded actions as captain of calais he led his ships in attacks on neutral hanseatic league and spanish ships in the channel on flimsy grounds of sovereignty he was summoned to london to face enquiries but he claimed that attempts had been made on his life and returned to calais york salisbury and warwick were summoned to a royal council at coventry but they refused fearing arrest when they were isolated from their own supporters york summoned the nevilles to join him at his stronghold at ludlow castle in the welsh marches on  september  at the battle of blore heath in staffordshire a lancastrian army failed to prevent salisbury from marching from middleham castle in yorkshire to ludlow shortly afterwards the combined yorkist armies confronted the much larger lancastrian force at the battle of ludford bridge warwicks contingent from the garrison of calais under andrew trollope defected to the lancastrians and the yorkist leaders fled york returned to ireland and his eldest son edward earl of march salisbury and warwick fled to calais the lancastrians were back in total control york and his supporters were attainted at the parliament of devils as traitors somerset was appointed governor of calais and was dispatched to take over the vital fortress on the french coast but his attempts to evict warwick were easily repulsed warwick and his supporters even began to launch raids on the english coast from calais adding to the sense of chaos and disorder being attainted only by a successful invasion could the yorkists recover their lands and titles warwick travelled to ireland to concert plans with york evading the royal ships commanded by the duke of exeter in late june  warwick salisbury and edward of march crossed the channel and rapidly established themselves in kent and london where they enjoyed wide support backed by a papal emissary who had taken their side they marched north king henry led an army south to meet them while margaret remained in the north with prince edward at the battle of northampton on  july the yorkist army under warwick defeated the lancastrians aided by treachery in the kings ranks for the second time in the war king henry was found by the yorkists in a tent abandoned by his retinue having apparently suffered another breakdown with the king in their possession the yorkists returned to london in the light of this military success richard of york moved to press his claim to the throne based on the illegitimacy of the lancastrian line landing in north wales he and his wife cecily entered london with all the ceremony usually reserved for a monarch parliament was assembled and when york entered he made straight for the throne which he may have been expecting the lords to encourage him to take for himself as they had acclaimed henry iv in  instead there was stunned silence york announced his claim to the throne but the lords even warwick and salisbury were shocked by his presumption they had no desire at this stage to overthrow king henry their ambition was still limited to the removal of his councillors the next day york produced detailed genealogies to support his claim based on his descent from lionel of antwerp duke of clarence yorks claim was through a daughter of a second son henrys through the son of a third son the judges felt that common law principles could not determine who had priority in the royal succession and declared the matter above the law and passed ther lernyng parliament agreed to consider the matter and accepted that yorks claim was better but by a majority of five they voted that henry vi should remain as king a compromise was struck in october  with the act of accord which recognised york as henrys successor disinheriting henrys sixyearold son edward york accepted this compromise as the best offer it gave him much of what he wanted particularly since he was also made protector of the realm and was able to govern in henrys name death of richard duke of yorkedit ruins of sandal castle near wakefield west yorkshire queen margaret and her son had fled to north wales parts of which were still in lancastrian hands they later travelled by sea to scotland to negotiate for scottish assistance mary of gueldres queen consort to james ii of scotland agreed to give margaret an army on condition that she cede the town of berwick to scotland and marys daughter be betrothed to prince edward margaret agreed although she had no funds to pay her army and could only promise booty from the riches of southern england as long as no looting took place north of the river trent the duke of york left london later that year with the earl of salisbury to consolidate his position in the north against the lancastrians who were reported to be massing near the city of york he took up a defensive position at sandal castle near wakefield over christmas  then on  december his forces left the castle and attacked the lancastrians in the open although outnumbered the ensuing battle of wakefield was a complete lancastrian victory richard of york was slain in the battle and both salisbury and yorks yearold second son edmund earl of rutland were captured and executed margaret ordered the heads of all three placed on the gates of york edwards claim to the throneedit parhelion at sunset the act of accord and the events of wakefield left the yearold edward earl of march yorks eldest son as duke of york and heir to his claim to the throne with an army from the proyorkist marches the border area between england and wales he met jasper tudors lancastrian army arriving from wales and he defeated them soundly at the battle of mortimers cross in herefordshire he inspired his men with a vision of three suns at dawn a phenomenon known as parhelion telling them that it was a portent of victory and represented the three surviving york sons himself george and richard this led to edwards later adoption of the sign of the sunne in splendour as his personal device margarets army was moving south supporting itself by looting as it passed through the prosperous south of england in london warwick used this as propaganda to reinforce yorkist support throughout the south – the town of coventry switched allegiance to the yorkists warwicks army established fortified positions north of the town of st albans to block the main road from the north but was outmanoeuvred by margarets army which swerved to the west and then attacked warwicks positions from behind at the second battle of st albans the lancastrians won another big victory as the yorkist forces fled they left behind king henry who was found unharmed sitting quietly beneath a tree henry knighted thirty lancastrian soldiers immediately after the battle in an illustration of the increasing bitterness of the war queen margaret instructed her sevenyearold son edward of westminster to determine the manner of execution of the yorkist knights who had been charged with keeping henry safe and had stayed at his side throughout the battle as the lancastrian army advanced southwards a wave of dread swept london where rumours were rife about savage northerners intent on plundering the city the people of london shut the city gates and refused to supply food to the queens army which was looting the surrounding counties of hertfordshire and middlesex yorkist triumphedit edward iv edward of march having joined with warwicks surviving forces advanced towards london from the west at the same time that the queen retreated northwards to dunstable as a result edward and warwick were able to enter london with their army they found considerable support there as the city was largely yorkistsupporting it was clear that edward was no longer simply trying to free the king from bad councillors but that his goal was to take the crown thomas kempe the bishop of london asked the people of london their opinion and they replied with shouts of king edward the request was quickly approved by parliament and edward was unofficially crowned in an impromptu ceremony at westminster abbey edward vowed that he would not have a formal coronation until henry vi and his wife were removed from the scene edward claimed henry had forfeited his right to the crown by allowing his queen to take up arms against his rightful heirs under the act of accord parliament had already accepted that edwards victory was simply a restoration of the rightful heir to the throne edward and warwick marched north gathering a large army as they went and met an equally impressive lancastrian army at towton the battle of towton near york was the biggest battle of the wars of the roses both sides agreed beforehand that the issue would be settled that day with no quarter asked or given an estimated – men took part with over  men being killed during and after the battle an enormous number for the time and the greatest recorded single days loss of life on english soil edward and his army won a decisive victory and the lancastrians were routed with most of their leaders slain henry and margaret who were waiting in york with their son edward fled north when they heard the outcome many of the surviving lancastrian nobles switched allegiance to king edward and those who did not were driven back to the northern border areas and a few castles in wales edward advanced to take york where he replaced the rotting heads of his father his brother and salisbury with those of defeated lancastrian lords such as the notorious john clifford th baron de clifford of skiptoncraven who was blamed for the execution of edwards brother edmund earl of rutland after the battle of wakefield edward ivedit harlech castle gwynedd wales the official coronation of edward iv took place in june  in london where he received a rapturous welcome from his supporters after the battle of towton henry vi and margaret had fled to scotland where they stayed with the court of james iii and followed through on their promise to cede berwick to scotland later in the year they mounted an attack on carlisle but lacking money they were easily repulsed by edwards men who were rooting out the remaining lancastrian forces in the northern counties several castles under lancastrian commanders held out for years dunstanburgh alnwick the percy family seat and bamburgh were some of the last to fall there was also some fighting in ireland at the battle of piltown in  the yorkish supporter thomas fitzgerald th earl of desmond defeated the lancastrian butlers of kilkenny the butlers suffered more than  casualties local folklore claims that the battle was so violent that the local river ran red with blood hence the names pill river and piltown baile an phuill meaning town of the blood there were lancastrian revolts in the north of england in  several lancastrian nobles including the third duke of somerset who had apparently been reconciled to edward readily led the rebellion the revolt was put down by warwicks brother john neville a small lancastrian army was destroyed at the battle of hedgeley moor on  april but because neville was escorting scottish commissioners for a treaty to york he could not immediately follow up this victory then on  may he routed somersets army at the battle of hexham somerset was captured and executed the deposed king henry was later captured for the third time at clitheroe in lancashire in  he was taken to london and held prisoner at the tower of london where for the time being he was reasonably well treated about the same time once england under edward iv and scotland had come to terms margaret and her son were forced to leave scotland and sail to france where they maintained an impoverished court in exile for several years the last remaining lancastrian stronghold was harlech castle in wales which surrendered in  after a sevenyearlong siege warwicks rebellion and the death of henry viedit middleham castle the powerful earl of warwick the kingmaker had meanwhile become the greatest landowner in england already a great magnate through his wifes property he had also inherited his fathers estates and had been granted much forfeited lancastrian property he also held many of the offices of state he was convinced of the need for an alliance with france and had been negotiating a match between edward and a french bride however edward had married elizabeth woodville the widow of a lancastrian knight in secret in  he later announced the news of his marriage as fait accompli to warwicks considerable embarrassment this embarrassment turned to bitterness when the woodvilles came to be favoured over the nevilles at court many of queen elizabeths relatives were married into noble families and others were granted peerages or royal offices other factors compounded warwicks disillusionment edwards preference for an alliance with burgundy rather than france and reluctance to allow his brothers george duke of clarence and richard duke of gloucester to marry warwicks daughters isabel and anne furthermore edwards general popularity was on the wane in this period with higher taxes and persistent disruptions of law and order louis xi of france by  warwick had formed an alliance with edwards jealous and treacherous brother george who married isabel neville in defiance of edwards wishes in calais they raised an army that defeated the kings forces at the battle of edgecote moor edward was captured at olney buckinghamshire and imprisoned at middleham castle in yorkshire warwick briefly had two kings of england in his custody warwick had the queens father richard woodville st earl rivers and her brother john executed however he made no immediate move to have edward declared illegitimate and place george on the throne the country was in turmoil with nobles once again settling scores with private armies in episodes such as the battle of nibley green and lancastrians being encouraged to rebel few of the nobles were prepared to support warwicks seizure of power edward was escorted to london by warwicks brother george neville the archbishop of york where he and warwick were reconciled to outward appearances when further rebellions broke out in lincolnshire edward easily suppressed them at the battle of losecoat field from the testimony of the captured leaders he declared that warwick and george duke of clarence had instigated them they were declared traitors and forced to flee to france where margaret of anjou was already in exile louis xi of france who wished to forestall a hostile alliance between edward and edwards brotherinlaw charles the bold duke of burgundy suggested the idea of an alliance between warwick and margaret neither of those two formerly mortal enemies entertained the notion at first but eventually they were brought round to realise the potential benefits however both were undoubtedly hoping for different outcomes warwick for a puppet king in the form of henry vi or his young son margaret to be able to reclaim her familys realm in any case a marriage was arranged between warwicks daughter anne and margarets son edward of westminster and warwick invaded england in the autumn of  battle of tewkesbury edward iv had already marched north to suppress another uprising in yorkshire warwick with help from a fleet under his nephew the bastard of fauconberg landed at dartmouth and rapidly secured support from the southern counties and ports he occupied london in october and paraded henry vi through the streets as the restored king warwicks brother john neville who had recently received the empty title marquess of montagu and who led large armies in the scottish marches suddenly defected to warwick edward was unprepared for this event and had to order his army to scatter he and richard duke of gloucester fled from doncaster to the coast and thence to holland and exile in burgundy they were proclaimed traitors and many exiled lancastrians returned to reclaim their estates warwicks success was shortlived however he overreached himself with his plan to invade burgundy in alliance with the king of france tempted by king louis promise of territory in the netherlands as a reward this led edwards brotherinlaw charles of burgundy to provide funds and troops to edward to enable him to launch an invasion of england in  edward landed with a small force at ravenspur on the yorkshire coast initially claiming to support henry and to be seeking only to have his title of duke of york restored he soon gained the city of york and rallied several supporters his brother george turned traitor again abandoning warwick having outmaneuvered warwick and montagu edward captured london his army then met warwicks at the battle of barnet the battle was fought in thick fog and some of warwicks men attacked each other by mistake it was believed by all that they had been betrayed and warwicks army fled warwick was cut down trying to reach his horse montagu was also killed in the battle margaret and her son edward had landed in the west country only a few days before the battle of barnet rather than return to france margaret sought to join the lancastrian supporters in wales and marched to cross the severn but was thwarted when the city of gloucester refused her passage across the river her army commanded by the fourth successive duke of somerset was brought to battle and destroyed at the battle of tewkesbury her son prince edward the lancastrian heir to the throne was killed with no heirs to succeed him henry vi was murdered shortly afterwards on  may  to strengthen the yorkist hold on the throne richard iiiedit richard iii the restoration of edward iv in  is sometimes seen as marking the end of the wars of the roses proper peace was restored for the remainder of edwards reign his youngest brother richard duke of gloucester and edwards lifelong companion and supporter william hastings were generously rewarded for their loyalty becoming effectively governors of the north and midlands respectively george of clarence became increasingly estranged from edward and was executed in  for association with convicted traitors when edward died suddenly in  political and dynastic turmoil erupted again many of the nobles still resented the influence of the queens woodville relatives her brother anthony woodville nd earl rivers and her son by her first marriage thomas grey st marquess of dorset and regarded them as powerhungry upstarts parvenus at the time of edwards premature death his heir edward v was only  years old and had been brought up under the stewardship of earl rivers at ludlow castle on his deathbed edward had named his surviving brother richard of gloucester as protector of england richard had been in the north when edward died hastings who also held the office of lord chamberlain sent word to him to bring a strong force to london to counter any force the woodvilles might muster the duke of buckingham also declared his support for richard richard and buckingham overtook earl rivers who was escorting the young edward v to london at stony stratford in buckinghamshire on  april although they dined with rivers amicably they took him prisoner the next day and declared to edward that they had done so to forestall a conspiracy by the woodvilles against his life rivers and his nephew richard grey were sent to pontefract castle in yorkshire and executed there at the end of june princes in the tower painted by john everett millais edward entered london in the custody of richard on  may and was lodged in the tower of london elizabeth woodville had already gone hastily into sanctuary at westminster with her remaining children although preparations were being made for edward v to be crowned on  june at which point richards authority as protector would end on  june richard held a full meeting of the council at which he accused hastings and others of conspiracy against him hastings was executed without trial later in the day thomas bourchier the archbishop of canterbury then persuaded elizabeth woodville to allow her younger son the yearold richard duke of york to join edward in the tower having secured the boys robert stillington bishop of bath and wells then alleged that edward ivs marriage to elizabeth woodville had been illegal and that the two boys were therefore illegitimate parliament agreed and enacted the titulus regius which officially named gloucester as king richard iii the two imprisoned boys known as the princes in the tower disappeared and were possibly murdered by whom and under whose orders remains controversial there was never a trial or judicial inquest on the matter perkin warbeck claimed he was the younger of the princes from  and was recognised as such in international diplomacy outside england having been crowned in a lavish ceremony on  july richard then proceeded on a tour of the midlands and the north of england dispensing generous bounties and charters and naming his own son as the prince of wales buckinghams revoltedit for more details on this topic see buckinghams rebellion opposition to richards rule had already begun in the south when on  october the duke of buckingham who had been instrumental in placing richard on the throne and who himself had a distant claim to the crown led a revolt aimed at installing the lancastrian henry tudor it has been argued that his supporting tudor rather than either edward v or his younger brother showed buckingham was aware that both were already dead the lancastrian claim to the throne had descended to henry tudor on the death of henry vi and his son in  henrys father edmund tudor st earl of richmond had been a halfbrother of henry vi but henrys claim to royalty was through his mother margaret beaufort she was descended from john beaufort who was a son of john of gaunt and thus a grandson of edward iii john beaufort had been illegitimate at birth though later legitimised by the marriage of his parents it had supposedly been a condition of the legitimation that the beaufort descendants forfeited their rights to the crown henry had spent much of his childhood under siege in harlech castle or in exile in brittany after  edward iv had preferred to belittle henrys pretensions to the crown and made only sporadic attempts to secure him however his mother margaret beaufort had been twice remarried first to buckinghams uncle and then to thomas lord stanley one of edwards principal officers and continually promoted her sons rights buckinghams rebellion failed some of his supporters in the south rose up prematurely thus allowing richards lieutenant in the south the duke of norfolk to prevent many rebels from joining forces buckingham himself raised a force at brecon in midwales he was prevented from crossing the river severn to join other rebels in the south of england by storms and floods which also prevented henry tudor landing in the west country buckinghams starving forces deserted and he was betrayed and executed the failure of buckinghams revolt was clearly not the end of the plots against richard who could never again feel secure and who also suffered the loss of his wife and elevenyearold son putting the future of the yorkist dynasty in doubt henry viiedit henry vii many of buckinghams defeated supporters and other disaffected nobles fled to join henry tudor in exile richard made an attempt to bribe the duke of brittanys chief minister pierre landais to betray henry but henry was warned and escaped to france where he was again given sanctuary and aid confident that many magnates and even many of richards officers would join him henry set sail from harfleur on  august  with a force of exiles and french mercenaries with fair winds he landed in pembrokeshire six days later the officers richard had appointed in wales either joined henry or stood aside henry gathered supporters on his march through wales and the welsh marches and defeated richard at the battle of bosworth field richard was slain during the battle supposedly by the major welsh landowner rhys ap thomas with a blow to the head from his poleaxe rhys was knighted three days later by henry vii henry having been acclaimed king henry vii then strengthened his position by marrying elizabeth of york daughter of edward iv and the best surviving yorkist claimant he thus reunited the two royal houses merging the rival symbols of the red rose of lancaster and the white rose of york into the new emblem of the red and white tudor rose henry shored up his position by executing all other possible claimants whenever any excuse was offered a policy his son henry viii continued many historians consider the accession of henry vii to mark the end of the wars of the roses others argue that they continued to the end of the fifteenth century as there were several plots to overthrow henry and restore yorkist claimants only two years after the battle of bosworth yorkists rebelled led by john de la pole earl of lincoln who had been named by richard iii as his heir but had been reconciled with henry after bosworth the conspirators produced a pretender to the throne a boy named lambert simnel who bore a close physical resemblance to the young edward earl of warwick son of george of clarence the best surviving male claimant of the house of york this plan was on very shaky ground because the young earl was still alive and in king henrys custody and was paraded through london to expose the impersonation at the battle of stoke field henry defeated lincolns army lincoln died in the battle simnel was pardoned for his part in the rebellion and was sent to work in the royal kitchens henrys throne was again challenged in  with the appearance of the pretender perkin warbeck who claimed he was richard duke of york the younger of the two princes in the tower warbeck made repeated attempts to incite revolts with support at various times from the court of burgundy and james iv of scotland he was captured after the failed second cornish uprising of  and executed in  after attempting to escape from prison during the reign of henry viis son henry viii the possibility of yorkist challenges to the throne remained until as late as  in the persons of edward stafford rd duke of buckingham edmund de la pole rd duke of suffolk and his brother richard de la pole all of whom had blood ties to the yorkist dynasty but were excluded by the prowoodville tudor settlement to an extent englands break with rome was prompted by henrys fears of a disputed succession should he leave only a female heir to the throne or an infant who would be as vulnerable as henry vi had been to antagonistic or rapacious regents aftermathedit historians debate the extent of impact the wars had on medieval english life the classical view is that the many casualties among the nobility continued the changes in feudal english society caused by the effects of the black death these included a weakening of the feudal power of the nobles and an increase in the power of the merchant classes and the growth of a centralised monarchy under the tudors the wars heralded the end of the medieval period in england and the movement towards the renaissance after the wars the large standing baronial armies that had helped fuel the conflict were suppressed henry vii wary of any further fighting kept the barons on a very tight leash removing their right to raise arm and supply armies of retainers so that they could not make war on each other or the king the military power of individual barons declined and the tudor court became a place where baronial squabbles were decided with the influence of the monarch revisionists such as the oxford historian k b mcfarlane suggest that the effects of the conflicts have been greatly exaggerated and that there were no wars of the roses many places were unaffected by the wars particularly in the eastern part of england such as east anglia it has also been suggested that the traumatic impact of the wars was exaggerated by henry vii to magnify his achievement in quelling them and bringing peace the effect of the wars on the merchant and labouring classes was far less than in the long drawnout wars of siege and pillage in europe which were carried out by mercenaries who profited from long wars although there were some lengthy sieges such as those of harlech castle and bamburgh castle these were in comparatively remote and less populous regions in the populated areas both factions had much to lose by the ruin of the country and sought quick resolution of the conflict by pitched battle philippe de commines observed in  the realm of england enjoys one favour above all other realms that neither the countryside nor the people are destroyed nor are buildings burnt or demolished misfortune falls on soldiers and nobles in particular exceptions to this claimed general rule were the lancastrian looting of ludlow after the largely bloodless yorkist defeat at ludford bridge in  and the widespread pillaging carried out by queen margarets unpaid army as it advanced south in early  both events inspired widespread opposition to the queen and support for the yorkists many areas did little or nothing to change their city defences perhaps an indication that they were left untouched by the wars city walls were either left in their ruinous state or only partially rebuilt in the case of london the city was able to avoid being devastated by convincing the york and lancaster armies to stay out after the inability to recreate the defensive city walls few noble houses were extinguished during the wars in the period from  to  before the outbreak of the wars there were as many extinctions of noble lines from natural causes  as occurred during the fighting  from  to  the most ambitious nobles died and by the later period of the wars fewer nobles were prepared to risk their lives and titles in an uncertain strugglecitation needed the kings of france and scotland and the dukes of burgundy played the two factions off against each other pledging military and financial aid and offering asylum to defeated nobles and pretenders to prevent a strong and unified england from making war on them

unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message following defeat in the hundred years war english landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings this is often considered a contributory cause of the wars of the roses the wars were fought largely by the landed aristocracy and armies of feudal retainers with some mercenaries at the end of the hundred years war large numbers of unemployed soldiery returned to england seeking employment in the growing armies of local nobility england drifted toward misrule and violence under the weak governance as local noble families like the nevilles and percies increasingly relied on their feudal retainers to settle disputes it became common practice for landowners to bind their mesnie knights to their service with annual payments half of an indenture contract the randomly cut or indented edge proves a match to the counterpart document edward iii had developed the contract system where the monarch entered into formal written contracts called indenture with experienced captains who were contractually obligated to provide an agreed upon number of men at established rates for a given period frequently the landed nobility acted the principal or main contractor knights men at arms and archers were often subcontracted in addition to professional retainers a lord could find men amongst his tenantry these included landless men and others who would crave the security of maintenance and livery skilled archers could command as high a wage as knights as baronial armies grew in size the rule of law was weakened support for each house largely depended upon dynastic factors such as blood relationships marriages within the nobility and the grants or confiscations of feudal titles and lands given the conflicting loyalties of blood marriage and ambition it was not uncommon for nobles to switch sides several battles such as northampton and bosworth were decided by treacherycitation needed the armies consisted of nobles contingents of menatarms with companies of archers and footsoldiers such as billmen there were also sometimes contingents of foreign mercenaries armed with cannon or handguns the horsemen were generally restricted to prickers and scourers ie scouting and foraging parties the rules of military engagement changed as civil war succeeded overseas campaigns it was customary for the heavy cavalry to fight entirely on foot in several cases noblemen dismounted and fought among the common footsoldiers to inspire them and to dispel the notion that in the case of defeat they might be ransomed while the common soldiers being of little value faced death it was often claimed however that the nobles faced greater risks than the ordinary soldiers as there was little incentive for anyone to take prisoner any highranking noble during or immediately after a battle during the hundred years war against france a captured noble would be able to ransom himself for a large sum but in the wars of the roses a captured noble who belonged to a defeated faction had a high chance of being executed as a traitor for example fortytwo captured knights were executed after the battle of towton the burgundian observer philippe de commines who met edward iv in  reported king edward told me in all the battles which he had won as soon as he had gained victory he mounted his horse and shouted to his men that they must spare the common soldiers and kill the lords of whom none or few escaped even those who escaped execution might be declared attainted and therefore possessing no property and of no value to a captorref chronological list of battlesedit first battle of st albans

thanks i dont like savings falsefilter marks of cadency in the british royal family marks of cadency in the british royal family introduction in the case of royal families arms are also arms of dominion and it is therefore important to distinguish junior members of the family richard lionheart was the first to use the arms of england his brother john perhaps differenced by bearing two lions instead of three henry iii and his brother the earl of cornwall bore altogether different arms the latter adopting the arms of the county of poitou which he claimed and briefly held in the s differencing seems to take root with the children of henry iii at first a label or bordure charged with devices inspired by the mothers or the wifes arms for the next three generations the heir apparent differences with a label azure while other sons use a label or a bordure of a different tincture or bearing charges bordures continued to be used as mark of cadency into the th century however with the children of edward iii the use of a label argent contrasting with both quarters of france and england bearing various charges becomes a norm in scotland the label azure remained the rule for the heir apparent down to henry son of james vi of scotland the number of points is still not meaningful the tudors and stuarts had few junior sons marks used by the plantagenets label ermine or label of york were used an innovation arises with the children of james duke of york who bears a label of three points ermine they are given a label of five points ermine first instance of the use of  points to denote grandchildren of a sovereign the duke of kendal was given a label of  points but it was becoming clear by then that charles ii would have no legitimate heirs and in fact the duke of yorks arms were sometimes shown with a label of three points argent the modern system really takes shape around  marks of cadency are determined and granted for life to the individual by royal warrant from the th century members of the royal family do not have arms until assigned to them and these arms are not necessarily inheritable the heir apparent bears a label of three points argent and his eldest son the same with a cross gules on the center label but note that the current prince of waless eldest son bears an escallop gules other children of the sovereign male and female whereas females did not use to bear marks of cadency bear labels of three points argent with various charges while grandchildren of the sovereign receive labels of five points in the th century it seems that the eldest sons of younger sons heirs to dukedoms differenced with a second label eg cumberland cambridge gloucester which was later removed by a second warrant once they succeeded this changed under victoria all grandsons of the sovereign in male line are given fivepoint labels which explains why the st duke of kent had a label of  points and the d duke presently has a label of  points given the typical lifespan a sovereign has to assign marks at most to two generations george ii granted point and point labels george iii granted point labels to his children victoria granted a batch of point and point labels she had the possibility of issuing warrants for her greatgrandchildren but never did later george v in  granted labels of  points to his sons elizabeth has granted labels of  points to her children and labels of  points to her cousins grandchildren of george v and three of her grandchildren how far does the sovereigns choice of marks of cadency extend members of the royal family were until  the children of the sovereign royal highnesses and the descendants in male line highnesses from  to  the children and grandchildren of the sovereign royal highnesses since  the children of the sovereign children of the sovereigns sons eldest son of the eldest son of the prince of wales by royal warrant dated  feb  the labels assigned to a grandchild of a sovereign except the eldest son of a prince of wales became hereditary and are borne as part of the arms together with ordinary marks of difference when appropriate however it appears that younger sons of the prince of wales can expect to have their label of  points changed to a label of  points if and when they become sons or brothers of a sovereign the children of the sovereigns daughters and granddaughters in male line used to quarter their mothers arms in victoria and edward viis time but this practice has ceased in this reign the earl of harewood bears his fathers arms only see the page of the college of arms on

england under the tudors england under the tudors luminarium  encyclopedia  whats new  letter from the editor  bookstore  poster store  discussion forums  search   arthur prince of wales  the eldest son of henry vii was born at winchester on  sept  his mother was elizabeth of york the eldest daughter of edward iv whom his father after he obtained the crown had married in fulfilment of a promise that he had made in exile the marriage was intended to have the effect of putting an end to the wars of the roses by uniting the rival houses of york and lancaster and the firstborn was naturally an object of great solicitude he was baptised in winchester cathedral the sunday after his birth and was named arthur after the famous british hero whose fabulous exploits fill the pages of geoffrey of monmouth his descent was traced by industrious genealogists from cadwallader and the ancient british kings so that while on the mothers side he was the undoubted heir of the house of york the defects of his fathers title were compensated by a pedigree carried back to the fabled brutus in  when only three years old he was created knight of the bath his education was looked to with peculiar care his first master after he had learned the elements of letters was one john rede who it seems was also his chaplain but after a time—apparently when he was in his tenth year—he was placed under the tuition of the blind poet laureate bernard andre who gives a glowing account of his proficiency before he was sixteen he had not only studied the leading grammarians but was familiar with all the best greek and latin authors whose names the enraptured tutor proudly enumerates in his life of henry vii but the interest of his brief life turns altogether upon the story of his marriage with katharine of arragon negotiations had already taken place with a view to that marriage as early as  when he was not yet two years old ferdinand and isabella perceiving that notwithstanding the uncertainty of the succession in england created by the recent civil wars henry might be a valuable ally against france and one that it was desirable to win while on the other hand the friendship of a recently united spain was an equally important object to secure on the part of england the marriage project of course was no more at first than a prospective link between the two kingdoms in a comparatively remote future but as lord bacon remarks the very treaty itself gave abroad in the world a reputation of a strait conjunction audamitv between them which served on both sides to many purposes that their several affairs required and yet they continued still free ferdinand was too great a politician to conclude the arrangement definitely till he was sure that no future simnels or warbecks could do much to shake henrys throne henry on the other hand was continually on his guard lest by virtue of the treaty he should make himself a mere catspaw to carry out the designs of ferdinand at length however all difficulties were removed katharine landed at plymouth on  oct  and was married to arthur at st pauls on  nov following three times had the prince gone through a form of marriage with her already before her arrival in england the spanish ambassador acting as her proxy—all to satisfy the doubts of ferdinand lest there should be some evasion on the part of england now all was secure and though
