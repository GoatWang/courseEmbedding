each index’s target maturity year proceeds of constituents that are called or mature between rebalances are reinvested in week us treasury bills until the next monthly rebalancing of the index the reinvested amount is reallocated on a pro rata basis across index constituents at the next monthly rebalance beginning on july  of an index’s target maturity year the index is calculated using a proprietary methodology that seeks to track the return of a heldtomaturity individual bond in accordance with this methodology the portfolio of bonds established in connection with the last monthly rebalancing of an index prior to july  of its target maturity year will be fixed for the remainder of the life of the index as bonds in an index mature or are called and principal is returned proceeds are reinvested in week us treasury bills until the termination of the index it is expected that each index will consist largely if not completely of assets invested in such instruments when it

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
