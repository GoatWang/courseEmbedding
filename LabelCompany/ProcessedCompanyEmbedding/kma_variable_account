publications variable annuities and variable life products questions to ask june   variable annuities and variable life insurance products combine features of insurance and securities investments  they can be an important part of your retirement and investment plans but it is important to make sure they are right for you  recently the sec issued a report on how these products are sold  based on the problems we’ve seen here are some important questions we recommend that you ask before purchasing a variable product  might i need this money in the next few years  variable products are longterm investment vehicles  they aren’t appropriate if you’ll need your money in the short term because substantial taxes and insurance company charges may apply if you withdraw your money early do i have enough money right now to purchase this product  because variable products are longterm investments it can be dangerous to your financial health to mortgage your home in order to purchase a variable annuity or variable life insurance product  if a salesperson pressures you to do so call us instead at sec am i being urged to purchase a variable annuity or variable insurance in my ira k or other retirement account  one key benefit to purchasing variable products is the fact that earnings on the invested money accumulate taxdeferred  but these tax benefits are of no value if you’re purchasing the product in your ira k or other retirement account because those accounts are already taxadvantaged  make sure that the features you’re buying are worth the money you’re paying does the firm recommend this product to all its customers  everyone has different investment objectives  variable products are not “one size fits all”  be careful if a salesman recommends one product to all customers  that may mean the product isn’t right for you what will i lose if i exchange this product  if a salesperson is urging you to exchange your variable product for a new contract you’ll need to compare both products carefully because the guaranteed death benefit of the new product may be less than the old you may have to pay a “surrender charge” to get out of the old product the new product may impose higher annual fees and a new surrender charge and  the new product may impose a new surrender charge period for more information on how variable annuities work and what you should know

highspeed digital to multiplexer mux  serializer ic the ic shown in fig  functions seamlessly over data rates fbit ranging from dc to gbps the main function of the ic is to multiplex  parallel data channels running at a bit rate of fbit into a high speed serial bit stream running at fbit it provides a highspeed output data channel for pointtopoint data transmission over a controlled impedance media of ω the transmission media can be a printed circuit board or copper coaxial cables the functional distance of the data transfer is dependent upon the attenuation characteristics of the transportation media and the degree of noise coupling to the signaling environment   during normal operation the serializer’s lowspeed input buffer ls dibx accepts external bit wide parallel data words “d”“d” through  differential lvds inputs and delivers them to the multiplexer’s core mux for serialization a full rate clock must be provided by an external source “ce” to the highspeed clock input buffer hs cib where it is routed to the high speed clock output buffer hs cob and the internal dividerby  the divider provides signaling for mux and produces a full rate clock dividedby “c” for the low speed lvds compliant clock output buffer lvds cobthe phase of “clo” can be modified by ° increments by utilizing pins “phs” and “phs” and the clock processing block by utilizing pin “bitorder” the serializer can designate either “d” or “d” as the msb thus simplifying the interface between asnta and a proceeding asic   the serialized words are transmitted as level signals “qcml” by a differential cml output buffer data ob a fullrate clock is transmitted by hs cob in parallel with the highspeed data the clock and data outputs are well phase matched to each other resulting in very little relative skew over the operating temperature range of the device both output stages are back terminated with onchip ω resistors the serializer uses a single v power supply and is characterized
