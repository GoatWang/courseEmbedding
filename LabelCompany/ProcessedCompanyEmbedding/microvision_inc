known as vitrectomy probes vitreous cutter or vitrector consist of vitrectomy cutters irrigation sleeves and pressure line adapters the vitrectomy cutter attaches to an airvacuum source for cutting and aspiration to remove intraocular material  the irrigation sleeve is used with the vitrectomy cutter to deliver fluids for infusion into the eye the vitrectomy cutters are used for removing tissue within the eye  vitrectomy cutters are pneumatically driven via a tubing line attached to a source host capable of delivering a series of pressures pulses  the pneumatic pulses actuate a cannulaguillotine style cutter at rates up to  cuts per minute  the removed tissue is aspirated through the center cannula of the cutter and through a second tubing line connected to the source host capable of generating vacuum trocars the trocar device family consists of a trocar cannula inserter closure valves and a universal infusion line the trocar cannula is a stainless steel tube the inserter is either dull  step system or piercing  step system and is used to properly insert the trocar cannula into the eye the closure valves are silicone devices that seal the trocar cannula when instruments are removed the universal infusion line is a silicone tube with a plastic luer fitting on one end and an infusion cannula on the other end retinal implants the retinal implant family consists of solid silicone extruded strips grooved strips circling bands or sleeves solid molded tires meridionals or wedges or extruded sponge silicone circles ovals or grooved strips retinal implants are intended for intrascleral and episcleral buckling in the surgical treatment of retinal detachments where the retina is reattached to preserve a patient’s vision  a significant feature of the implants is that they conform to the anatomy of the eye easily they are intended for long term use iris retractors iris retractors consist of a bright blue polypropylene fiber with a unique easy to adjust silicone stopper  they are ideal for temporary iris dilatation and can be inserted through a  mm incision iris retractors are used to manually dilate the iris in small pupils during anterior and posterior segment surgeries  they can be used for floppy iris syndrome management in flomax® patients fiber optics the fiber optic device family consists of fiber optic illuminators and fiber optic adapters for connection to fda approved illumination sources the aluminum fiber optic connector attaches to the illumination source or to the aluminum adapter that attaches to the illumination source fiber optic probes have a polished distal tip designed to reduce shadows and rings and to ease of insertion into the sclerotomy the fiber optic probes are only sold as sterile single use devices the fiber optic adapters are sold nonsterile and should be sterilized by end user prior to use there are three configurations of fiber optic probes each having a unique distal treatment influencing the projected light pattern focal wide angle with and without shield the focal fiber optic has a relatively flat distal surface providing an angle of light less than  degrees  the wide angle fiber optic has a parabolic style distal tip creating a wider angle and diffused light  due to the parabolic style distal tip used for wide angle light an optional shielded version is available to block the inherent glare laser probes the laser probes have been designed to provide photocoagulation cauterization during vitreoretinal surgery and are adaptable to most laser machines  the devices involve a fiber optic endoprobe supported by a hand piece  they are indicated for use at laser operating wavelengths of  to nm this includes nm nm and nmthe hand piece is connected through a relatively long flexible lead to a laser energy source  the laser probes may also be connected to a source of illumination andor aspiration scleral plugs scleral plugs are stainless steel plugs the  ga plugs are colorcoded with gold plating the scleral plugs are placed into a plastic tablet which holds them in place until the point of use the scleral plugs are intended to be inserted into an unused incision to prevent fluid loss and maintain pressure during ophthalmic surgeries they may be removed when access through these incisions is necessary backflush instruments backflush instruments involve an aluminum handle that houses a silicone reservoir and has a luer fitting attached to the distal end both passive handoperated and active connected to aspiration system instruments are
