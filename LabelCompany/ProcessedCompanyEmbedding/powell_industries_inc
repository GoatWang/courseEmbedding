benefitssecured portal markets served by powell oil and gas refining  the refining of oil and gas requires large amounts of electrical energy to separate crude oil into its basic parts this is a primary market and application for powell solutions distributing controlling and monitoring the power systems for refineries is often a complex integration of equipment including metalclad switchgear for the distribution of electrical power motor control used in the various processes monitoring and control of the energy system interconnectivity with other systems environmental controls and communications powell has equipment located in refineries all around the world including north america south america middle east far east europe and asiaoffshore oil and gas production  a production platform is selfcontained providing for all of its own infrastructure needs powell modules range in size from a few hundred to well over one thousand tons and typically contain very complex arcresistant metalclad switchgears and a vast array of interconnections to other critical electrical components such as generators and associated controls battery systems transformers drives and command and control systems these solutions designed to withstand the harsh conditions of the open sea are also complex in mechanical design with fire rated walls and doors and blast proof walls powell offshore modules can be found in the gulf of mexico in the far east and off the coasts of africa mexico central america and south america​petrochemical  processing of crude oil component raw stock into useable raw materials such as plastics and chemicals also requires large amounts of electrical energy and is therefore a significant market for powell products and solutions powell typically provides one or more integrated equipment enclosures pcr® or ehouse containing metalclad switchgear metalenclosed switchgear motor control drives bus duct and communications all interconnected to perform as a fully functional interrelated system these enclosures are often located in hazardous areas due to the volatile nature of the materials or in highly corrosive environments where the mechanical and environmental design of the integrated package is as critical as the electrical distribution design ​pipelines  the movement of liquid or gas materials from one location to another is most efficiently and safely accomplished using pipelines this transport may be from the primary source such as the crude oil production point to the refinery where the oil will be divided into useable components from the refinery to petrochemical facilities where the components are processed into secondary raw materials or from petrochemical facilities to terminals for transport to other locations or for sale to end users pumping stations along the pipeline are required to move the material and these stations require electrical power powell secondary substations are used to provide that electrical power​​terminals  storage and receiving facilities are typically located at the end points of pipelines and are used to store the pipeline material as it waits for other transport methods such as tankers or other connective pipelines tanker ships can either bring crude oil from remote destinations and offload it for shipment to refining facilities or on load finished product for transport and sale to remote locations anytime there is large scale movement of liquid or gas product dependable electrical energy is required these facilities typically use powellintegrated equipment enclosures pcr® or ehouse containing metalclad switchgear metalenclosed switchgear motor control drives bus duct and communications systemspulp and paper  the plants that turn wood and cellulosebased raw material into a useable form and the mills that take that pulp and convert it into paper and paper products are both extremely heavily equipmentbased the material must be pulverized cleaned bleached transported pressed dried and sized all of this production requires large amount of electrical energy and powell products and solutions are used throughout when industries are highly pricecompetitive and when equipment uptime and utilization factors are important the dependability of electrical energy is a critical element powell integrated solutions of arcresistant metalclad switchgear are used whenever capital investment in plant and equipment such as this is made​mining and metals  modern mines are often located in remote mountainous areas and are required to process large amounts of rock and ore to extract relatively small amounts of useable metal the process typically processes large volumes of material which must be crushed and processed at the site this process needs tons of pressure and therefore is powered by large motors run at medium voltage levels the resulting output is transported to facilities where the material is refined into useable raw material for sale to manufacturers powell has equipment in mining operations in the united states canada south america and the far east where materials such as gold silver copper iron and other basic building products are produced​traction power  as city populations become more and more dense the movement of people becomes a bigger and bigger problem the implementation of mass transit rail systems has long been the solution in major metropolitan areas these train systems can be classified several ways heavy rail light rail electric railway streetcar and people movers the purpose of traction power substations is to provide power to these rail systems substations to provide the needed energy to run the trains are required every  miles along the track the typical traction power substation receives ac power from a utility at medium voltage specialty transformers step this voltage down and it is rectified to the required specific dc operating voltage  dc switchgear is utilized to supply the rectifier output power to the trains extensive command and control systems are also needed to manage such operations powell is a leading supplier of these substations in north america and around the worldelectric utilities  the electrical power market is divided into three main segments generation of the electrical power transmission from point to point and distribution of the electrical power to endusers powell is a solutionprovider to two of these segments where electricity is generated metalclad switchgear is needed to connect it to the transformers that will step up the voltage to very high levels for transmission to other locations at the end point of transmission metalclad switchgear is again required to distribute that energy to the various local systems and users of the energy powell specializes in mediumvoltage so our equipment and distribution substations are installed in both the generation and distribution segments ​ switchgear solutionsintegrated
