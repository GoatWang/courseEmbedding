thanks kenwas this rating useful  flag  submitted may   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgebait and switch worthless treatments at four times implied costs  a legalized scam bilking us tens of thousandswas this rating useful  flag  submitted february   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei was referred to this doctor by a pain management clinic because of financial reasons i was very excited to see dr stein but that quickly faded upon my first visit he spent it all of three minutes with me i have had two previous low back surgeries and was facing a third one he didnt seem to care about my records my history or my concerns at the present time he was rude and obnoxious and that is an understatement i was required to take a urine screening subsequent of my first two visits when i went to see dr stein on my third visit he informed me that my urine screening came up negative for all drugs including the ones he was prescribing me it was impossible he refused to talk to me about it and made me leave the clinic with a discharge notice i was very confused so i called shortly after i left and spoke to a woman at the front desk she informed me that she would not give me a copy of my medical records and then hung up on me something very shady is going on at this clinic they take your money the doctor spends less than  seconds with you andrea lee could not care less about how youre actually doing upon my first visit i asked if we could discuss other options that would deter me from taking pain medication for my entire life and he said since i was a postsurgical patient he could keep me on drugs with no problem that is the exact opposite of what i wanted and i made that very clear he did not care whatsoever i am currently trying to get my medical records from them but they are dragging their feet because in my opinion i believe they are doing many things that are against the law he is by far the worst pain management doctor on the planet please beware when considering going to this doctor was this rating useful  flag  submitted november   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgemilwaukee pain treatment tells you preliminary treatments are required before the advertised miracle disc decompressionbate and switch but wont disclose costsalso a wisconsin statute then you receive horrendous bills twice that of other pain clinics over  for a temporary cortisone shot and a  minute nerve ablation which if you can find the fine print has little effectiveness and also temporary fighting them in court court commissioners and judges side with milwaukee pain which files over  judgment casesyear and  in the last five  you are treated like the criminal was this rating useful  flag  submitted january   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei really think you are to call your clients in for pill counts you will find one of your clients is taking way too much medication and does not have any of his medication laughed  gc was this rating useful  flag  submitted january   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei am an rn and my husband was seeing dr stein all i know is that their billing is horrible evidently they charge over a thousand dollars every month for a urine drug screen that they do in minutes in their office that is absolutely ridiculous then your bill will jump from one hundred and fifty dollars to over two thousand and when asked no one will be able to explain it i had my husband question them early on when i received an eob from my insurance company from an outside lab for over a thousand dollars in lab charges and when questioned dr steins wife replied dont worry about it we have an agreement with that lab for billing your account is fine i eventually did get my husband to go see a reputable pain dr after his bill jumped up with no explanation then they took him to court and he went and contested it unfortunately he does not read well and did not realize he only had a couple weeks to fill out his arguement and get it in he didnt give me the paperwork because we were extremely busy moving and i was working long hours since he didnt get his paperwork in within that two week period dr stein was awarded over three thousand dollars we never did get an explanation as to why the bill went from three hundred to three thousand dollars my guess would be the fraudulent urine drug screening charges now they are taking the money from my checks i am not done with them i am so angry they are taking food and necessities from my childrenwas this rating useful  flag  submitted april   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgedr stein is excellent if you have physical proof that you suffer from pain he will give you the best options of what is right for you i have been a patient for over a year and dont mind a drug screen every visit cause i have nothing to hide listen to him and do what is expected of you if all you want is a script for opiates then dont come here because he is not a quack the staff is excellent and friendly dr stein is very professional and listens to his patients like i said if you have proof you suffer he will help you you people that are badmouthing need to keep going to your street dealer because dr stein does not just hand out pain meds was this rating useful  flag  submitted march   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei am at a huge loss of words i never in my life been to a clinic that the dr talked to me like a child after my first app the first thing i said to my friend was he didnt even look at me  his eyes looked down the whole two min he was in the room i thought it was just me until i read these other messages from others wow so his wife works with him  my last appointment i asked forn cream she said we dont do that hear what like are u kidding me they dont write script for mucsle cream ooooook i guess i should open my own pain clinic if its this easy to rip ppl off i am going to call m y insurance to see what they billing me forwas this

messed up my back so bad during his famous disc decompression he raved about he comes in sees you for  minutes does not even look at you and write scripts his so called first exam is only you walking for him thats how he determines what kind of treatment you need the physical therapy department although is very nice is completely worthless and his wife who does the scheduling and is in reception is really a piece of work she certainly needs to go to school for customer servicewhen youre in his parking lot you get approached by several people to purchase your scripts and he pays lots of money to come up first in the internet when you search for pain management stay away from this doctor and find yourself a new one he will only cause a headache and when you try to get your records he does
