cfo spotlight – matthew k fust onyx pharmaceuticals matthew k fust joined onyx pharmaceuticals in  as executive vice president and chief financial officer he is responsible for key functions including financial planning and analysis accounting tax and sec reporting as well as information technology facilities and purchasing as cfo of this fastgrowing biopharmaceutical company based in south san francisco california matt assists the company in key strategic initiatives including the potential launch of a new cancer medicine the building of new financial and operational processes and global market expansion hes wellequipped to lead these strategic initiatives he has previously served as cfo for jazz pharmaceuticals perlegen sciences and alza corporation he was also a manager in the healthcare strategy practice at anderson consulting here matt discusses onyx and his strategic role at the company as well as how the finance organization is supporting market expansion and launching new products two areas identified in our  cfo benchmark survey as top company priorities for this year q describe the culture of onyx pharmaceuticals a we are focused on developing innovative cancer therapies so for us everything starts with patients our ceo tony coles is a physician by training and continually reminds us that patients are waiting that is the guidepost for our company and gives us a real sense of urgency about our mission today we are on the cusp of a new phase of unprecedented growth we have  employees and we expect to continue to grow in the nearterm q what drives your growth a innovation drives our growth and there is strong patient need for innovative medicines today we have one approved therapy called nexavar in two types of cancer by the end of this year we could have registrationenabling data or regulatory approvals for three different treatments in as many as seven different cancers it is unusual for companies in our industry to have built such a full pipeline in a short period of time q your business category requires very specific skill sets to be present in its workforce how do you acquire talent a we are fortunate to be relatively small with an entrepreneurial culture this environment offers real opportunities to individual scientists and other experts and helps us attract some of the best and brightest in the industry as well as business and financial minds our employees tell us they derive a lot of satisfaction from the flexible and entrepreneurial way that we do business they work in teams but have quite a lot of professional independence and enjoy seeing their contributions come to fruition in creating treatments that help patients that makes us confident that from a human resource perspective well be able to continue to scale up for growth q major initiatives are underway for onyx including international expansion which is driven by major product launches how do you as cfo support these strategic projects a expansion and launches specifically are always complex undertakings and the finance groups works closely with other key areas of the organization on these activities for example our group is involved in identifying the potential number of patients a new therapy or a new indication could benefit we also ensure that we have the right infrastructure on the ground and hire the right talent and level of support as we grow this involves partnering with incountry experts and outsourced providers and vendors who can help us get a competitive foothold overseas as well as determining the right size and composition of our sales force and we are closely involved in product supply chain management to ensure that there is sufficient supply to meet patient and physician demand at time of launch and afterwards in the area of product launches we do not have inhouse manufacturing so it is our responsibility to source and engage thirdparty manufacturers who will ultimately produce our drugs on a mass scale in a safe and effective manner for patients q how do you source effective incountry support a on one level i leverage my own network developed over two decades of experience in the capital markets and the accounting profession for referrals we also work closely with groups within the organization such as our onyx corporate development and supply chain teams which build a global network of contacts from executives at other pharmaceutical companies to top vendors in different nations and in the united states q elaborate a little more on your expansion plans a in europe we are in latestage development with our drug kyprolis the proposed trade name for carfilzomib for the potential treatment of patients with multiple myeloma a deadly blood cancer a clinical trial which may enable marketing approval for kyprolis in europe is currently underway and we expect to complete patient enrollment in the first quarter of next year at this point we dont have exact timing of when we could potentially have the treatment available to patients in europe but we are actively building our european presence in anticipation of potential launch we recently established our first overseas office in zug switzerland which will serve as our european headquarters we hired a highly qualified commercial lead to build our team there and to prepare for potential launch since we will market our medicines directly in europe the ramp up of an organization always needs to be coordinated closely with potential regulatory decisions but we believe that we will be ready to fully engage the european market if and when we receive approval q are there any barriers to expansion that concern you a as we grow we need to ensure we are hiring the best people to lead this expansion our hiring in the us has gone very well and our vision and growth make us attractive to the types of employees we need here in europe we are less of a known entity and we are ensuring that we find talent with an entrepreneurial mindset that reflects that culture we have built as an organization we are confident that we can successfully manage scaling up in europe with the right team and are already making great strides in this effort onyx is ambitious about global expansion and we can see that in asia for example we will need to explore a number of different structures in japan for instance our corporate development teams work has led to a partnership with ono pharmaceutical a leading drug developer and marketer that has agreed to drive development of kyprolis in japan q lets move to process improvement what are the challenges there for onyx a we are not old or large enough to be engaged in a lot of process improvements or process reengineering i see this as an advantage because we can leverage the very latest in new technology and best practices to drive efficiency we have recently hired a chief information officer to lead our it effort and continue to build our strategy as we become global our it platform must be geared to collapsing distance so we will develop a strategy for effective communications with all our key constituencies for instance we recently implemented voip for integrated voice and data communications we will also have a mobile platform for ipads that our salesforce will use in conjunction with a crm product and we are exploring deployment of telepresence conferencing technology we need to take advantage of the productivity gains now possible through full integration of front end dashboards such as business intelligence and budgeting and forecasting applications with our back end systems q cfos we hear from almost without exception desire to spend more time as a strategic partner to their ceos and boards and less time on accounting compliance and risk management how is your time divided a our ceo tony coles specifically requested a seasoned cfo with industry experience and a strategic orientation he wanted a business strategist who would be a thought partner to him and the executive team and who could effectively interact with the investment community and other stakeholders as a result more than half of my time is spent on strategic development financial strategy and on attracting investment in our company ive been fortunate to be able to work with people who i trust and who make me comfortable that my other major responsibilities such as accounting compliance and risk management are covered very well as new technology is put in place i can see even more time being freed up for me and members of my team to concentrate on strategic activity  what makes onyx a tremendously interesting company for our employees is our fast growth the complexity of our business and the difference that we can make in the lives of patients these are the attributes that attracted me to the company as well comments please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus comments powered by disqus
