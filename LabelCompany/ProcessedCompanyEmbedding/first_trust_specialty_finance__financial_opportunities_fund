rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through todays date and then dividing by the most recent market price the distribution consists of the sum of net investment income net realized shortterm capital gains net realized longterm capital gains and return of capital distribution rates may vary any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until

reflect sales load past performance is not indicative of future results  leverage is a technique where a closedend funds manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate seeking to increase yield and total return use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses  market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions which can differ from regulatory financial reports forms ncsr and nq that are based on trade date recording of security transactions holdings are subject to change risk considerations the fund is subject to risks including the fact that it is a nondiversified closedend management investment company investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost the fund invests in business development companies bdcs which may be subject to a high degree of risks including managements ability to meet the bdcs investment objective and to manage the bdcs portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding a bdc or its underlying investments change investing in real estate investment trusts reits involves certain unique risks in addition to investing in the real estate industry in general reits are subject to interest rate risk and the risk of default by lessees or borrowers the fund may invest in a variety of other mortgagerelated securities rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of mortgagerelated securities making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates and may reduce the market value of the securities in addition mortgagerelated securities are subject to the risk that borrowers may pay off their mortgagees sooner than expected particularly when interest rates decline this can reduce the funds returns the funds investments in other assetbacked securities are subject to risks similar to those associated with mortgagebacked securities as well as additional risks associated with the nature of the assets and the servicing of those assets because the fund is concentrated in the financials sector it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting this sector such as changes in interest rates availability and cost of capital funds and competition use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses the risks of
