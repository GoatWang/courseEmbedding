riley allen justin anthony wayne adams larkin co larkin company  table of contents  john d larkin and the larkin company excerpted without footnotes from the nomination for the hydraulicslarkin neighborhood section e pp 7 by jennifer walkowski  john d larkin and the larkin company of all the businesses and industries which found a home in the hydraulics neighborhood by far the largest and most successful was the larkin company makers of soaps toiletries and a wide variety of household products in the age befor e the industrial revolution of the midnineteenthcentury soap making originally was a small cottage industry in the united states soap making became one of many industries which benefited from massproduction thanks to new machinery and technologies like many of the companies in the neighborhood the larkin company took advantage of the hydraulics area’s proximity to regional and national transportation routes raw materials and ample labor force rising from humble origins in the latenineteenthcentury by the early twentiethcentury the larkin company grew to become one of the largest companies in the city of buffalo and also the country john durrant larkin was born in buffalo in  at 3 clinton street where the nre lafayette hotel now stands the middle child of seven born to mary ann durrant and levi larkin founder of the clinton iron works3 john d larkin became involved in the soap industry in  when he began working as a clerk in the office of the buffalo soap works of his brotherinlaw justus weller by  larkin was made a partial partner in the company and when weller decided to relocate the company to chicago in 7 larkin was invited to relocate with the firm becoming a full partner larkin spent five years in chicago forming personal connections and learning much about the business end of the company his time in the growing metropolis laid the foundation for his later individual career in the soap industry sometime in 7 larkin was introduced to weller’s uncle dr silas hubbard who lived in bloomington illinois the relationship between the hubbard family and john larkin became a significant association and the two families would become intertwined following this initial meeting dr hubbard’s teenage son elbert was encouraged to join the soap company of larkin  weller as a salesman and john larkin would marry elbert’s older sister frances or frank as she was nicknamed in 7 the happy times of the weller hubbard and larkin families would not last for long and by 7 justus weller’s marriage to mary larkin ended in divorce forcing john d larkin to leave the larkin and weller company to establish a soap works of his own after travelling to boston larkin eventually returned to his hometown of buffalo which provided the transportation and animal fats needed to grow a successful soap industry especially the hydraulics neighborhood larkin’s first factory was located at  chicago street in buffalo’s old first ward area and by 77 the company had grown so rapidly that larkin purchased property at 7 seneca street in the hydraulics neighborhood in order to build a larger factory adjacent to rail lines and the needed raw materials larkin employed his brotherinlaw elbert hubbard as his first salesman and a onethird partner hubbard travelled widely for the company in his years as a salesman or “slinger” as they were known spending the years between 7 and 7 travelling between buffalo chicago and milwaukee in 7 hubbard’s role in the company grew and he hired frank martin from dayton ohio to lead a crew of doortodoor “slingers” for the company in 7 frank’s young thirteenyearold brother darwin d martin was brought to buffalo as one of the “slinger” crew by the late 7s the “jd larkin  co” firm was well established during the height of its activities the larkin company was a sales and marketing pioneer the company’s initial sales strategy was a typical doortodoor campaign which brought the soap and toiletry products direct to the consumer in the early s the company began including a small premium item such as a handkerchief or a small chromolithograph in each box of soap to entice customers to purchase larger quantities the idea of including a premium was not invented by the larkin company but the company was highly successful at the combination of directmail solicitation to the customer rather than a shopkeeper or middleman and the enticement of premiums allowed the company to sell directly to the customer by  the larkin company was able to completely eliminate the middlemen from its business dealings in  larkin marketing mastermind elbert hubbard created the successful “combination box” an assortment of soaps and toiletry items which was shipped on thirtydays approval allowing customers to try and use the products or return them for a refund the company’s selection of premium items also expanded during the s to include products such as the popular “chautauqua lamp” first offered in  and the “chautauqua desk” which was offered in  these highquality premium products encouraged bulk purchases of soap and other products the “larkin idea” marketing strategy embodied the spirit of the larkin company’s directtotheconsumer approach if a customer was willing to commit ten dollars about one week’s pay for most people at the time to a direct purchase of a year’s supply of soap then the larkin company agreed to share the advantage in the form of an attractive premium item this strategy promoted a sense of “quasifamilial” intimacy between the consumer – or “larkinite”  and the company and is the root of much of modern marketing strategies today the larkin company also pioneered the concept of getting the average consumer involved in the sales process called “larkin clubs of ten” which began in the early s these clubs consisted of ten families generally under the guidance of the females of the family who pooled their financial resources in order to buy the expensive combination boxes and to share the premium offerings while members drew straws to win the premium prize by the tenth month all members obtained a premium some enterprising people purchased the boxes and sold them to their friends family and neighbors keeping the premiums for themselves in this way the larkin company replaced the typical sales force with primarily housewives and women effectively reducing packaging shipping and administrative costs and because the women who ran the club acted in the place of the more typical corporatesponsored sales staff the larkin company saved on labor and other related costs these clubs were the forerunner of avon tupperware parties and other types of female consumersold product as early as  the larkin company employed nearly one hundred factory workers and had organized into four departments of shipping clerks mailadvertising helpers bookkeeper and a “miscellaneous” group borrowing the card ledger system of the local ymca library darwin martin created a unique bookkeeping and tracking system for the larkin company in  recently promoted from his sales position by september of  martin noted over 3 accounts in the ledger and as business continued to prosper he soon created and supervised both the order and bookkeeping departments and hired a staff of assistants the combination of the business sense of john d larkin the administrative skills of darwin d martin and the salesmanship of elbert hubbard turned the larkin company into one of the most successful companies in buffalo in the late nineteenthcentury as the company expanded its business into selling toiletries furniture lamps home products and a myriad of other items as the quantity and variety of the products produced by the company increased the size and scale of the production factory also grew the small brick factory at 7 seneca street was quickly outgrown and the larkin company constructed a series of simple utilitarian buildings near the intersection of swan and seneca streets between the s and  beginning in  the company constructed twelve new factory buildings ranging from eight to ten stories in height on an entire block of land at seneca street between larkin formerly heacock and van rensselaer streets fig c while appearing to be one enormous building the large bulk was actually divided in several smaller facilities for specialized production ranging from soap making wrapping storing lumber storage perfumes and a myriad of other functions a large power house building  and a railroad terminal warehouse building  were among other specialized building added to the growing larkin company complex designed by the rj reidpath company of buffalo these steel framed brickclad buildings were ideally suited for the needs of industrial manufacturing but were unsuitable for the office and corporate needs of the evergrowing company in  alone the larkin company was receiving over  letters per day and new members of the office staff were hired weekly to accommodate the rapidly growing administrative needs of the thriving company housed in the e and f buildings of the factory the increasing administrative aspects of the company coupled with the constant demand for new production spaces within the factory itself soon created the need for a new separate administration building although the factory site in the hydraulics was selected based on the area’s proximity to several major railroad routes the noisy dirty and polluted industrial neighborhood was not ideal for a significant office building to be constructed the typical office worker at the time was female and the larkin company felt they would not be enticed to work in this area of the city the new administrative building was also seen as a sort of figurehead for the company as well john d larkin selected frank lloyd wright as the architect for the new building on the recommendation of darwin martin who by this time had become treasurer and larkin’s brotherinlaw william heath who was the company’s head of the legal department designed and constructed between  and  the new larkin administration building at  seneca street just north of the company’s largest factory building in response to the industrial atmosphere around it the building was the height of modern technology creating a sealed healthy indoor environment and pioneered several hygienic features in large office buildings clean fresh air was circulated in the sealed building through a rudimentary type of air conditioning system which turned the blocky corner piers of the building into a massive circulation system a large interior courtyard infused the interior with natural light and allowed for additional air circulation in order to prevent the clutter common in large offices wright custom designed builtin metal office furniture file cabinets desks and even wallhung toilets the administration building also featured an elegant restaurant and conservatory where the female office workers could unwind and be entertained everything about the building was designed to be clean efficient pristine and modern in order to accommodate a staff of over  people upon its completion in  the larkin administration building was hailed as a triumph of modern architecture and office building design by european and american architects critics and historians alike the larkin administration building also was notable for its removal of the administrative and management functions from its previous location in the midst of the production floor previous to this era management staff and facilities of a majority of american factories and industrial buildings were typically located right in the heart of the production floor keeping management in touch with the labor force and the manufacturing process the larkin administration building created a separated building designated solely to the management and office tasks of the business perhaps spurred by the labor strikes and turmoil of this period in american history while the result created an emblematic building which was specifically designed to house and economize the clerical functions of the company the construction of the larkin administration building effectively severed the deeprooted connection between management and the labor force the larkin company continued to be successful well into the s by  the company manufactured a majority of the over ninehundred catalog items in its expansive factory complex which covered over sixteenandahalf acres on seneca street in the hydraulics in addition to their own soaps cleansers cosmetics perfume pharmaceuticals and food they offered consumers everything from clothing and furniture to utensils and radios with its primary corporate headquarters centered in buffalo the company had branches across the east coast in boston chicago peoria cleveland pittsburgh and new york city the company had expanded into many aspects of daily consumer life including the  larkin chain stores in western new york and peoria illinois and the larkinbranded fuel stations which pumped gas in buffalo rochester and erie pennsylvania over  employees proudly called themselves “larkinites” by the s the larkin company had expanded their range of products to cover nearly every aspect of daily life     the decline of the larkin company and the demolition of the administration building the larkin company was once one of the largest and most recognizable companies in the country soon after the company reached its largest and most influential phase in the s the company began suffering from both internal and external pressures many of the issues and obstacles faced by buffalo and specifically the hydraulics neighborhood in the midtwentiethcentury also led to the demise of the larkin company empire by the s during the late s and early s buffalo’s position as one of the most vital great lakes port and railroad city began to weaken this was due in part to the increasing number of crosscountry highways being constructed in the period and the rise of the trucking industry also the creation of new shipping lanes including the welland canal through ontario canada significantly expanded between  and  also helped traffic circumvent the buffalo and niagara falls area both of these conditions helped to undermine buffalo’s historic geographical advantage at the confluence of the great lakes and the east coast consumer culture also began to change during the interwar period as well the popularity of mailorder catalog business which had been the backbone of the larkin company’s sales strategy from its inception in the 7s began to wane as chain stores proliferated across the nation’s small towns allowing the consumer to view sample and directly purchase their goods the increasing popularity of the automobile allowed for greater mobility of small town residents who could come into the urban centers to visit stores which offered cutprice items with which the fixedprice larkin products could not compete in addition to these factors women who had been the primary larkin sales force through the turn of the century now had increasing opportunities in business and industry after world war i and were no longer drawn by the additional meager incomes which the larkin “clubs of ten” could bring the larkin company attempted to change with the times and stay afloat in the changing business climate of the postwar era the first of over several hundred “larkin economy stores” opened in  as a means to compete with the chain stores the company itself reorganized selling off subsidiary manufacturers and closing some of the branch offices in the s in additional to these external pressures internal problems also became more serious in this period john d larkin regarded the company as a familyrun operation to be continued by his sons and sonsinlaw larkin’s oldest son charles joined the company in the s but he lacked a passion for his father’s company and retired in  other family members were made executives in the early s including john d larkin jr who in  began taking an active role in company policy making setting the stage for his eventual takeover in  william heath larkin office manager since  abruptly retired from the larkin company in  and darwin martin soon followed retiring in  after butting heads with john d larkin jr the loss of these critical members of the larkin company core lead to a wave of other sudden retirements including three key members of the secretary’s department the increasing prominence of john d larkin jr in the larkin company brought about the retirement of most of the men who had built the company in its earliest mailorder days following the death of larkin sr in  his son john d larkin jr controlled the fate of the struggling company mirroring his disregard for the loyal and experienced executive core of the larkin company larkin jr had little regard for the stately architecture of his father’s administration building despite the onsite protests of frank lloyd wright the younger john larkin authorized the cutting of large windows into the fifth story of the building the larkin auditorium building which had played a role entertaining the throngs of larkin company employees for many years was demolished in the  to make way for a parking lot he relocated the mailorder business from the symbolic place of honor on the main floor of the light court to the fifth floor dryly renaming it the “buying department” various other departments were relocated and rearranged in the various factory buildings often with detrimental effects on workflow and productivity during john d larkin jr’s tenure as president of the larkin company between  and  the company struggled with increasing indebtedness the younger larkin continued to push for maintaining the large diverse premium catalog despite the changing marketplace and in the face of new competition during this period the larkin company faced shrinking sales revenues and the increased strain of the great depression by  the situation was so dire that the company’s board of directors was forced to take action to avoid bankruptcy as part of a restructuring deal the board separated the larkin co inc the company’s official name at the time from the company’s real estate holdings selling off properties whenever possible in order to help pay off the debt in the same year harry larkin replaced john d larkin jr as president and larkin jr soon resigned from the board of directors as well this same year saw the sale of the larkin administration building to the larkin co inc which moved the larkin department store into the first three floors of the building the much smaller mailorder department was housed in the fourth and fifth floors these moves taken by the larkin company were unsuccessful in preventing the collapse of the company however and in  additional corporations were created in order to allow stockholders to salvage portions of the business by  a creditor’s committee was formed most of the company’s assets were liquidated and the creditors were all paid off as a result the larkin company was left with no assets other than the administration building on which they owed  in back taxes the larkin company and the administration building was purchased in  by a contractor from harrisburg pennsylvania under the belief that the taxes owed would help offset large profits he was realizing from laying a transcontinental pipeline when the federal government denied the tax break he abandoned the building which stood unheated and unmaintained in  the city of buffalo took over the administration building in a  tax foreclosure proceeding the specificity of the design of the administration building with its central court and open plan coupled with the fact it had no inhouse heating facility made its reuse difficult the building’s location in the hydraulics neighborhood removed from the downtown core was also seen as an impediment to reuse in  an offer of  for the decaying building was made by an anonymous buyer but the common council sought a national advertising campaign as a way to increase the attention on the sale of the building this plan never materialized however once a potential housing project for the building was studied and ultimately deemed unfeasible further attempts to stimulate a high selling price for the administration building failed and it continued to decompose according to accounts everything from lighting fixtures knobs plumbing and even the copper roofs had been stripped from the building the iron fencing of the low brick wall which surrounded the building was removed for a wartime scrap collection the last attempt to reuse and save the festering administration building was made by councilman joseph f dudzick on april th  dudzick cried out against the treatment of such a worldrenowned building and announced plans to include the building in the program for city improvements ultimately dudzick’s attempts to save the building also failed on august th  the western trading corporation offered the common council  to demolish the larkin administration building and replace it with new developments which were claimed to provide the city with more tax income while the sale of the building was met with some public outcry the sale and impending demolition of the building was seen as a relief to some area residents demolition of the building began in february of  undertaken by the firm of morris  reimann due to the complex nature of the building’s construction the administration building was taken apart almost by hand in may  the western trading corporation had plans to build a trucking terminal on the site but by november they proposed to the common council relocating their facility their relocation was approved thus the larkin administration building was demolished to make way for what amounted to a paved parking lot frank lloyd wright upon hearing of the demolition of one of his earliest and most significant buildings reportedly stated that the building had “served its purpose and deserved a decent burial” he had been aware of the disfiguring alterations which the building had suffered under john d larkin jr as well as its final decay in the s in his autobiography he commented “they the larkins never realized the place their building took in the thought of the world – for they never hesitated to make senseless changes in it in after years” today all that remains of the onceglorious triumph of modern office design is a portion of the brick and sandstone wall which surrounded the site located near the swan street subway the creation of the larkin administration building and its ultimate demise and demolition in many ways mirrored the situation of the hydraulics neighborhood as a whole the building’s construction at the dawn of the twentiethcentury was an era of great prosperity and success in the thriving industrial and commercial neighborhood the larkin company itself had been a product of all the features which had given rise and made the hydraulics area a successful place to do business including its proximity to the nationwide network of rail lines access to raw materials and the availability of a vast immigrant labor pool ultimately the decay and demolition of the landmark building paralleled the downturn the hydraulics neighborhood took in the midtwentieth century facing population and business loss and the demolition of much of the urban architectural fabric of the neighborhood much of the original architectural fabric of the hydraulics neighborhood has been either altered beyond recognition or demolished all together those rare buildings which do remain intact are remnants of the past history of the hydraulics and survive to tell the neighborhood’s story today both the glorious larkin administration building and the thriving hydraulics neighborhood are faded memories relayed solely by the few remaining buildings which bear evidence of the past page by chuck lachiusa in   home page  buffalo architecture index buffalo history index email
