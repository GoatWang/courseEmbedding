fox around the size of a domestic cat found in the western grasslands of north america such as montana colorado new mexico kansas oklahoma and texas it also lives in manitoba saskatchewan and alberta in canada where it was previously extirpated it is closely related to the kit fox and the two species are sometimes known as subspecies of vulpes velox because hybrids of the two species occur naturally where their ranges overlap the swift fox lives primarily in shortgrass prairies and deserts it became nearly extinct in the s as a result of predator control programs but was successfully reintroduced later currently the conservation status of the species is considered by the iucn as least concern owing to stable populations elsewhere like most canids the swift fox is an omnivore and its diet includes grasses and fruits as well as small mammals carrion and insects in the wild its lifespan is three to six years and it breeds once annually from late december to march depending on the geographic region pups are born anywhere from march to midmay and are weaned at six to seven weeks old the swift fox is closely related genetically to the kit fox vulpes macrotis but occupies a different geographical range the two have historically been regarded as different species for reasons basically related to size the kit fox is slightly smaller than the swift fox and the former has a narrower snout however hybrids between the two occur naturally where their ranges overlap and some mammalogists classify the two as subspecies of a single species usually treated as vulpes velox with the swift fox being described as v velox velox and the kit fox as v velox macrotis the molecular genetics evidence is not conclusive however and some of those who have used it continue to treat the swift fox and kit fox as separate species contents  description  distribution and habitat  conservation status  behavior  reproduction  diet  references  general references  external links

in the summer daytime activities are usually confined to the den but it has been known to spend the warm midday period above ground during the winter the swift fox is more heavily dependent on its den than most north american canids using them as shelter from predators these dens are usually underground burrows that are two to four meters in length it has been known to run very fast at speeds of over  kmh  mph or up to  kmh  mph  the coyote is the swift foxs main predator but often chooses not to consume the swift fox other predators include the badger golden eagle and bobcat it is also vulnerable to trapping and poisoning as well as death on highways reproductionedit swift foxes are a socially monogamous species although multiple breeding strategies have been observed the adult swift foxs breeding season varies with region in the southern united states it mates between december and february with pups born in march and early april while in canada the breeding season begins in march and pups are born in midmay the male swift fox matures and may mate at one year while the female usually waits until her second year before breeding adults live in pairs and although some individuals mate for life others choose different partners each year gestation takes around  days and four to five kits are born the swift fox only has one litter annually but may occupy up to thirteen dens in one year moving because prey is scarce or because skin parasites build up inside the den sometimes it makes other burrows from other bigger animals even though it is completely capable of digging one on its own pups are born in the den and typically remain there for approximately one month a newborn pups eyes and ears remain closed for ten to fifteen days leaving it dependent on the mother for food and protection during this time it is usually weaned around six or seven weeks old and remains with its parents until fall recent research has shown that social organization in the swift fox is unusual among canids since it is based on the females females maintain territories at all times but males emigrate if the resident female is killed or removed dietedit like most canids the swift fox is an omnivore rabbits mice ground squirrels birds insects and lizards are staples grasses and fruits round out its diet however like any efficient forager the swift fox takes advantage of seasonal foods during the summer adults eat large amounts of insects including beetles and grasshoppers and feed their young with larger prey items deer and other carrion killed by other animals may also be important food sources referencesedit  a b wozencraft wc  order carnivora in wilson de reeder dm mammal species of the world a taxonomic and geographic reference rd ed johns

concern iucn  scientific classification kingdom animalia phylum chordata class mammalia order carnivora family canidae genus vulpes species v velox binomial name vulpes velox say  swift fox range synonyms hebes merriam  the swift fox vulpes velox is a small light orangetan fox around the size of a domestic cat found in the western grasslands of north america such as montana colorado new mexico kansas oklahoma and texas it also lives in manitoba saskatchewan and alberta in canada where it was previously extirpated it is closely related to the kit fox and the two species are sometimes known as subspecies of vulpes velox because hybrids of the two species occur naturally where their ranges overlap the swift fox lives primarily in shortgrass prairies and deserts it became nearly extinct in the s as a result of predator control programs but was successfully reintroduced later currently the conservation status of the species is considered by the iucn as least concern owing to stable populations elsewhere like most canids the swift fox is an omnivore and its diet includes grasses and fruits as well as small mammals carrion and insects in the wild its lifespan is three to six years and it breeds once annually from late december to march depending on the geographic region pups are born anywhere from march to midmay and are weaned at six to seven weeks old the swift fox is closely related genetically to the kit fox vulpes macrotis but occupies a different geographical range the two have historically been regarded as different species for reasons basically related to size the kit fox is slightly smaller than the swift fox and the former has a narrower snout however hybrids between the two occur naturally where their ranges overlap and some mammalogists classify the two as subspecies of a single species usually treated as vulpes velox with the swift fox being described as v velox velox and the kit fox as v velox macrotis the molecular genetics evidence is not conclusive however and some of those who have used it continue to treat the swift fox and kit fox as separate species contents  description  distribution and habitat  conservation status  behavior  reproduction  diet  references  general references  external links descriptionedit the swift fox has a dark grayish tan coloration that extends to a yellowish tan color across its sides and legs the throat chest and belly range from pale yellow to white in color its tail is blacktipped and it has black patches on its muzzle its ears are noticeably large it is about  inches  cm in height and  inches  cm long measuring from the head to the tip of the tail or about the size of a domestic cat its weight ranges from around five to seven pounds males and females are similar in appearance although males are slightly larger distribution and habitatedit the swift fox resides primarily in deserts and shortgrass prairies they form their dens in sandy soil on open prairies in plowed fields or along fences it is native to the great plains region of north america and its range extends north to the central part of alberta and saskatchewan canada and south to texas it reaches from western iowa to colorado kansas wyoming nebraska and montana conservation statusedit the swift fox was once a severely endangered species due to predator control programs in the s that were aimed mostly at the gray wolf and the coyote the species was extirpated from canada by  but a reintroduction program started in  has been successful in establishing small populations in southeast alberta and southwest saskatchewan despite the fact that many reintroduced individuals do not survive their first year nonetheless by   foxes had been released in the albertasaskatchewan border and milk river ridge areas parts of the species native range in may  the species at risk act listed the swift fox as an endangered species in canada a small relatively stable population continues to live free in the southeastern regions of alberta and southwestern regions of saskatchewan exact population numbers of the swift fox are unknown but it is known that they currently inhabit only  of their historic range in addition to its populations in canada there are also swift fox populations in the united states ranging from south dakota to texas in  the us fish and wildlife service determined that the fox warranted an endangered listing but other higher priority species precluded its listing this prompted state wildlife agencies within the foxs range to create the swift fox conservation team which worked to implement better swift fox management and monitoring programs populations in the united states are stable in the central part of its range and it is not considered endangered in the united states the iucn red list

light orangetan fox around the size of a domestic cat found in the western grasslands of north america such as montana colorado new mexico kansas oklahoma and texas it also lives in manitoba saskatchewan and alberta in canada where it was previously extirpated it is closely related to the kit fox and the two species are sometimes known as subspecies of vulpes velox because hybrids of the two species occur naturally where their ranges overlap the swift fox lives primarily in shortgrass prairies and deserts it became nearly extinct in the s as a result of predator control programs but was successfully reintroduced later currently the conservation status of the species is considered by the iucn as least concern owing to stable populations elsewhere like most canids the swift fox is an omnivore and its diet includes grasses and fruits as well as small mammals carrion and insects in the wild its lifespan is three to six years and it breeds once annually from late december to march depending on the geographic region pups are born anywhere from march to midmay and are weaned at six to seven weeks old the swift fox is closely related genetically to the kit fox vulpes macrotis but occupies a different geographical range the two have historically been regarded as different species for reasons basically related to size the kit fox is slightly smaller than the swift fox and the former has a narrower snout however hybrids between the two occur naturally where their ranges overlap and some mammalogists classify the two as subspecies of a single species usually treated as vulpes velox with the swift fox being described as v velox velox and the kit fox as v velox macrotis the molecular genetics evidence is not conclusive however and some of those who have used it continue to treat the swift fox and kit fox as separate species contents  description  distribution and habitat  conservation status  behavior  reproduction  diet  references  general references  external links descriptionedit the swift fox has a dark grayish tan coloration that extends to a yellowish tan color across its sides and legs the throat chest and belly range from pale yellow to white in color its tail is blacktipped and it has black patches on its muzzle its ears are noticeably large it is about  inches  cm in height and  inches  cm long measuring from the head to the tip of the tail or about the size of a domestic cat its weight ranges from around five to seven pounds males and females are similar in appearance although males are slightly larger distribution and habitatedit the swift fox resides primarily in deserts and shortgrass prairies they form their dens in sandy soil on open prairies in plowed fields or along fences it is native to the great plains region of north america and its range extends north to the central part of alberta and saskatchewan canada and south to texas it reaches from western iowa to colorado kansas wyoming nebraska and montana conservation statusedit the swift fox was once a severely endangered species due to predator control programs in the s that were aimed mostly at the gray wolf and the coyote the species was extirpated from canada by  but a reintroduction program started in  has been successful in establishing small populations in southeast alberta and southwest saskatchewan despite the fact that many reintroduced individuals do not survive their first year nonetheless by   foxes had been released in the albertasaskatchewan border and milk river ridge areas parts of the species native range in may  the species at risk act listed the swift fox as an endangered species in canada a small relatively stable population continues to live free in the southeastern regions of alberta and southwestern regions of saskatchewan exact population numbers of the swift fox are unknown but it is known that they currently inhabit only  of their historic range in addition to its populations in canada there are also swift fox populations in the united states ranging from south dakota to texas in  the us fish and wildlife service determined that the fox warranted an endangered listing but other higher priority species precluded its listing this prompted state wildlife agencies within the foxs range to create the swift fox conservation team which worked to implement better swift fox management and monitoring programs populations in the united states are stable in the central part of its range and it is not considered endangered in the united states the iucn red list characterizes it as of least concern behavioredit a swift fox napping during the day in a zoo in the wild the swift fox usually lives – years but may live up to  years in captivity it is primarily nocturnal spending only evenings and nighttime above ground in the summer daytime activities are usually confined to the den but it has been known to spend the warm midday period above ground during the winter the swift fox is more heavily dependent on its den than most north american canids using them as shelter from predators these dens are usually underground burrows that are two to four meters in length it has been known to run very fast at speeds of over  kmh  mph or up to  kmh  mph  the coyote is the swift foxs main predator but often chooses not to consume the swift fox other predators include the badger golden eagle and bobcat it is also vulnerable to trapping and poisoning as well as death on highways reproductionedit swift foxes are a socially monogamous species although multiple breeding strategies have been observed the adult swift foxs breeding season varies with region in the southern united states it mates between december and february with pups born in march and early april while in canada the breeding season begins in march and pups are born in midmay the male swift fox matures and may mate at one year while the female usually waits until her second year before breeding adults live in pairs and although some individuals mate for life others choose different partners each year gestation takes around  days and four to five kits are born the swift fox only has one litter annually but may occupy up to thirteen dens in one year moving because prey is scarce or because skin parasites build up inside the den sometimes it makes other burrows from other bigger animals even though it is completely capable of digging one on its own pups are born in the den and typically remain there for approximately one month a newborn pups eyes and ears remain closed for ten to fifteen days leaving it dependent on the mother for food and protection during this time it is usually weaned around six or seven weeks old and remains with its parents until fall recent research has shown that social organization in the swift fox is unusual among canids since it is based on the females females maintain territories at all times but males emigrate if the resident female is killed or removed dietedit like most canids the swift fox is an omnivore rabbits mice ground squirrels birds insects and lizards are staples grasses and fruits round out its diet however like any efficient forager the swift fox takes advantage of seasonal foods during the summer adults eat large amounts of insects including beetles and grasshoppers and feed their young with larger prey items deer and other carrion killed by other animals may also be important food sources referencesedit  a b wozencraft wc  order carnivora in wilson de reeder dm mammal species of the world a taxonomic and geographic reference rd ed johns

phylum chordata class mammalia order carnivora family canidae genus vulpes species v velox binomial name vulpes velox say  swift fox range synonyms hebes merriam  the swift fox vulpes velox is a small light orangetan fox around the size of a domestic cat found in the western grasslands of north america such as montana colorado new mexico kansas oklahoma and texas it also lives in manitoba saskatchewan and alberta in canada where it was previously extirpated it is closely related to the kit fox and the two species are sometimes known as subspecies of vulpes velox because hybrids of the two species occur naturally where their ranges overlap the swift fox lives primarily in shortgrass prairies and deserts it became nearly extinct in the s as a result of predator control programs but was successfully reintroduced later currently the conservation status of the species is considered by the iucn as least concern owing to stable populations elsewhere like most canids the swift fox is an omnivore and its diet includes grasses and fruits as well as small mammals carrion and insects in the wild its lifespan is three to six years and it breeds once annually from late december to march depending on the geographic region pups are born anywhere from march to midmay and are weaned at six to seven weeks old the swift fox is closely related genetically to the kit fox vulpes macrotis but occupies a different geographical range the two have historically been regarded as different species for reasons basically related to size the kit fox is slightly smaller than the swift fox and the former has a narrower snout however hybrids between the two occur naturally where their ranges overlap and some mammalogists classify the two as subspecies of a single species usually treated as vulpes velox with the swift fox being described as v velox velox and the kit fox as v velox macrotis the molecular genetics evidence is not conclusive however and some of those who have used it continue to treat the swift fox and kit fox as separate species contents  description  distribution and habitat  conservation status  behavior  reproduction  diet  references  general references  external links descriptionedit the swift fox has a dark grayish tan coloration that extends to a yellowish tan color across its sides and legs the throat chest and belly range from pale yellow to white in color its tail is blacktipped and it has black patches on its muzzle its ears are noticeably large it is about  inches  cm in height and  inches  cm long measuring from the head to the tip of the tail or about the size of a domestic cat its weight ranges from around five to seven pounds males and females are similar in appearance although males are slightly larger distribution and habitatedit the swift fox resides primarily in deserts and shortgrass prairies they form their dens in sandy soil on open prairies in plowed fields or along fences it is native to the great plains region of north america and its range extends north to the central part of alberta and saskatchewan canada and south to texas it reaches from western iowa to colorado kansas wyoming nebraska and montana conservation statusedit the swift fox was once a severely endangered species due to predator control programs in the s that were aimed mostly at the gray wolf and the coyote the species was extirpated from canada by  but a reintroduction program started in  has been successful in establishing small populations in southeast alberta and southwest saskatchewan despite the fact that many reintroduced individuals do not survive their first year nonetheless by   foxes had been released in the albertasaskatchewan border and milk river ridge areas parts of the species native range in may  the species at risk act listed the swift fox as an endangered species in canada a small relatively stable population continues to live free in the southeastern regions of alberta and southwestern regions of saskatchewan exact population numbers of the swift fox are unknown but it is known that they currently inhabit only  of their historic range in addition to its populations in canada there are also swift fox populations in the united states ranging from south dakota to texas in  the us fish and wildlife service determined that the fox warranted an endangered listing but other higher priority species precluded its listing this prompted state wildlife agencies within the foxs range to create the swift fox conservation team which worked to implement better swift fox management and monitoring programs populations in the united states are stable in the central part of its range and it is not considered endangered in the united states the iucn red list characterizes it as of least concern behavioredit a swift fox napping during the day in a zoo in the wild the swift fox usually lives – years but may live up to  years in captivity it is primarily nocturnal spending only evenings and nighttime above ground in the summer daytime activities are usually confined to the den but it has been known to spend the warm midday period above ground during the winter the swift fox is more heavily dependent on its den than most north american canids using them as shelter from predators these dens are usually underground burrows that are two to four meters in length it has been known to run very fast at speeds of over  kmh  mph or up to  kmh  mph  the coyote is the swift foxs main predator but often chooses not to consume the swift fox other predators include the badger golden eagle and bobcat it is also vulnerable to trapping and poisoning as well as death on highways reproductionedit swift foxes are a socially monogamous species although multiple breeding strategies have been observed the adult swift foxs breeding season varies with region in the southern united states it mates between december and february with pups born in march and early april while in canada the breeding season begins in march and pups are born in midmay the male swift fox matures and may mate at one year while the female usually waits until her second year before breeding adults live in pairs and although some individuals mate for life others choose different partners each year gestation takes around  days and four to five kits are born the swift fox only has one litter annually but may occupy up to thirteen dens in one year moving because prey is scarce or because skin parasites build up inside the den sometimes it makes other burrows from other bigger animals even though it is completely capable of digging one on its own pups are born in the den and typically remain there for approximately one month a newborn pups eyes and ears remain closed for ten to fifteen days leaving it dependent on the mother for food and protection during this time it is usually weaned around six or seven weeks old and remains with its parents until fall recent research has shown that social organization in the swift fox is unusual among canids since it is based on the females females maintain territories at all times but males emigrate if the resident female is killed or removed dietedit like most canids the swift fox is an omnivore rabbits mice ground squirrels birds insects and lizards are staples grasses and fruits round out its diet however like any efficient forager the swift fox takes advantage of seasonal foods during the summer adults eat large amounts of insects including beetles and grasshoppers and feed their young with larger prey items deer and other carrion killed by other animals may also be important food sources referencesedit  a b wozencraft wc  order carnivora in wilson de reeder dm mammal species of the world a taxonomic and geographic reference rd ed johns

neither has anyone else volpes velox™ has the smallest shape of any case weve seen and the lightest weight the interior foam will not be the hard beer cooler foam everyone else uses because its cheap to produce  no ours will be molded pound density opencell foam and at least an inch of it on all side of the trumpethowever to make the velox we need to have tooling made for the case mold as well as tooling for the extruded profile for the edge gasket and neither are cheap some of our extrusion quotes require  foot minimums to get the hardware we want also requires a large minimum order the gasket was designed around this hardware so we have no other choices at this point the gasket is the most important part and will allow us to immediately complete work on the trombone case weve been sitting on for far too longweve been making textile cases for  years but this is a radical new design in every way from the aramid core we intend to use on the high end carbon fiber model to the molded opencell foam interior to the tiny size and light weight we dont think anything this perfect has been offered before it is the holy grail of trumpet cases stiff tiny light protective and a perfect fitweve got the cad files done the plug and prototype has been created the velvet interior and hardware has been chosen and our suppliers have all provided quotes all we need now is you risks

schedule again but he has completed the exterior of the first fiberglass case so the finish line is in sight the first four fiberglass cases might ship quickly the rest will be at least a few weeks kelli will be contacting folks who placed orders to confirm their color choices back to top daytonveteran memberjoined  mar posts location usa posted fri jul    pm    post subject it should come as no surprise that there has been yet another delay with the velox steve kriesel said that the problem this time is with the foam molds which torpedo bags outsourced the foam molds were supposed to have been delivered to torpedo bags some time ago but instead will be delivered next week if that happens some velox cases will be assembled and shipped soon the original delivery estimate was july  im really looking forward to receiving my case one of these days and suspect that i will be every bit as impressed with the velox as i am with torpedo bags other cases  which are fantastic  but i am
