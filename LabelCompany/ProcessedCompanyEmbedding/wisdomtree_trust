etfs in june of  and is currently the industrys seventh largest by aum etf provider wisdomtree sponsors distinct etfs that span asset classes and countries around the world categories include us and international equity currency fixed income and alternatives wisdomtree pioneered the concept of fundamentally weighted etfs and active etfs and is currently an industry leader in both categories wisdomtree is the only publicly traded asset manager exclusively focused on the etf industry wisdomtree is listed on the nasdaq global market under the ticker wetf related links contact us press room careers at wisdomtree wisdomtree etfs our approach at wisdomtree we do things differently our etfs are built with proprietary methodologies smart structures or uncommon access to provide investors with the potential for income performance diversification and more  thoughtful innovation each of our etfs is exclusive to wisdomtree and each is designed to redefine how an investment is built or how a country or asset class is accessed smart engineering each etf is uniquely structured to offer the potential for performance risk management— or both redefined investing we combine what we believe are the best elements of active and passive investing to provide lowcost riskmanaged investments  ordinary brokerage commissions apply equities stock prices can—and do—deviate from their underlying value for many reasons wisdomtree believes fundamentals such as dividends or earnings offer more objective measures of a company’s health value and profitability than stock price alone the majority of etfs are market cap weighted—meaning they give more weight to companies selling at higher prices than those offering stronger fundamentals wisdomtree uses proprietary weighting methodologies designed to help magnify the effect fundamentals—such as dividends or earnings—have on risk and return characteristics learn more about equities currency hedged equity international investing provides many exciting opportunities to investors but these opportunities can come with additional risks—one of which is currency fluctuations wisdomtrees hedged equity family of funds enables investors to access the growth potential of numerous markets around the world while mitigating the risks of currency exposure learn more about currency hedged equity dollar sensitive equity given todays increased focus on the global economy investors are likely aware of how foreign currency movements can impact their international investments but changes in the us dollar can impact domestic investments as well consider that many us companies generate a large portion of their revenue outside the united states for these companies a strong dollar can hurt their competitiveness as their goods and services become more expensive to their international clients by the same token there are domestically oriented companies that may perform better when the dollar is strong learn more about dollar sensitive equity currency wisdomtree believes that investors should consider the benefits of diversifying their cash holdings on a global basis diversifying currency holdings offers investors the potential to earn higher yields while lowering the risk inherent to holding assets in only one currency learn more about currency fixed income how diversified are your fixed income holdings if youre only holding us fixed income instruments such as bonds the answer may be not enough through the dynamic combination of foreign interest rates and local currencies wisdomtrees international fixed income etfs offer investors income potential diversification potential—and much more in fact they may enable you to obtain more complete asset allocation learn more about fixed income alternative wisdomtree believes alternative investments provide a smart way to achieve diversification and performance potential in almost any market however these types of strategies have traditionally only been available to institutional investors through wisdomtree these sophisticated strategies are available to all investors—in the desirable etf structure learn more about alternative restricted material this material

objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
