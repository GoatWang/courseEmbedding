busy mind by david carrmarch   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story as writers’ offices go olaf olafsson’s is a bit of a surprise it is a giant lair in a futuristic skyscraper with enough room for both a desk and a big table along with an expansive view of central park with its abundant light and helpful assistant out front it’s not exactly the kind of dark warren where the author of sprawling historical novels would find himselfthen again this office is in the time warner center where mr olafsson does his day job as an executive vice president for international and corporate strategy at time warner at  am on a recent tuesday morning before going to work he had gotten up in his upper east side apartment and plunged into research on his next novel his discipline and dual life is all the more admirable given that “restoration” his waningdaysofwar novel set in the rolling hills of tuscany was published in februarymr olafsson  is no hobbyist having written four books in the past  years his work is characterized by meticulous attention to place and historical events given his deep and steady involvement in setting the strategic course of a global media company his ability to pull off serious novels at the same time is enough to make the rest of us feel like slackers “that’s funny i always scold myself for not being productive enough” he said his voice conveying his roots in iceland where two of his other books were partially set “if anything i think i am good at organizing my time i don’t go to a lot of social events so i think that gives me time that i can structure in other ways”some corporate executives have trouble fitting in a round of golf now and then let alone hundreds of hours of research and writing count jeffrey l bewkes the chief executive of time warner among the impressed advertisement continue reading the main story “i’ve read all of olaf’s books and i’m frankly amazed that a guy whom i rely on during the day to structure complex digital deals and identify international business opportunities can create novels with such rich characters and intricate plotlines” he said continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story “restoration” is an ambitious historical novel — it brings to mind “atonement” and “the english patient” — that motors along on a dark mystery taking place in the sunlit vistas of tuscany which mr olafsson visited as a young student and has been back to many times sincethere the two central female characters struggle to find a place to stand amid encroaching armies both the allies and axis powers have designs on the crumbling villa where they are staying their destinies are entwined with a single work of purloined art that may or may not be a masterpiece the plot is based in part on the life of iris origo a british expat of means who married an italian nobleman and spent years restoring a crumbling estate — where she sheltered refugee children — that also became a refuge for allied soldiers her memoir of that experience was called “war in val d’orcia” photo olaf olafsson credit fred r conradthe new york times ”i was messing around the topics of art and tuscany when i came across her diaries which are amazing and she became the basis for one of the characters” he said “i’m drawn to characters who aren’t black and white because i’m not a blackandwhite person”library journal called the book “beautifully realized” while a review in the new york times said it was a “mixed bag” that leaned too heavily on historical sourcesborn in reykjavik and the son of a novelist mr olafsson came to the united states to study at brandeis university in massachusetts graduating with a degree in physics he eventually ended up working at sony where he founded sony interactive entertainment in  and led the rollout of the sony playstation in the united states and europe at time warner he is a strategic adviser on digital and international matters and oversees a  million investment fund for new venturesthat disparate portfolio can be hard to reconcile with the quiet affable mr olafsson who is also married has three children and plays soccer — quite well judging by the trophies stashed in a drawer — when he isn’t writing novels or helping to run one of the world’s largest media companieslee boudreaux his editor at eccoharpercollins said she found herself wishing she worked with more writers like him advertisement continue reading the main story “he is überprofessional” she said “for someone who is extremely busy with a full family life and a very serious job he gets back to you immediately and decisively”artistically all has not gone so smoothly mr olafsson had to be pressed in an email to talk about his efforts as a playwright perhaps because “feast of snails” produced at the lyric theater in london in  was described by the daily mail as “bad ibsen with zero plausibility” photo olaf olafsson in his office at the time warner center the author of the recent war novel “restoration” he also finds time to be an executive credit fred r conradthe new york times his reaction to the review now “it wasn’t good” he said of the play “and i think i knew it you live and you learn”he has since survived an even bigger jolt to the system the disastrous time warner merger with aol he left the company but returned at the request of richard d parsons then the chief executive after the merger broke down and time warner reasserted controlin corporate life and in fiction best laid plans have a way of going astray but those who work with mr olafsson say he avoids drama “olaf is a very original thinker in terms of business and has no ambitions to rise up and gather more titles in the sometimes contrived world of big media” said joseph ravitch an investment banker who became a friend after they did a number of deals together “that gives him a great deal of independence he says what he thinks but stays above the

olafsson maintains that the oldnew media dichotomy is a false one and he all but shrugs when asked why he would pile a career as a novelist on top of an already overstuffed portfoliohe has written three other novels — “absolution” “the journey home” and “walking into night” — along with a collection of short stories “valentines” fred berner a film and television producer is working with mr olafsson to turn the stories in that volume into a television series“he has an insanely good work ethic turns things around quickly and for someone who is supposedly this solid nordic persona he writes women extremely well” mr berner saidmr olafsson has a reputation at time warner for collaboration and as a nonamerican he’s been particularly helpful in the international realm but beneath the exterior of his almost eerie nordic calm there is an operational ego at least when it comes to writing he admits that it is nice to be alone in a room where he doesn’t have to reach consensus with anyone else he likes playing god at least when he is typing“you don’t get much done around here by being autocratic or pontificating” he said “but when i am working on a novel i pretty much call all the shots” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related coverage olaf olafsson’s new novel ‘restoration’ feb   related coverage olaf

author of serenaacclaimed novelist olaf olafsson brings us restoration a sweeping story of love tested by human frailty and the terrors and tragedies of war  departing from the landscapes of his native iceland—so beautifully evoked in absolution the journey home and other previous works—olafson sets restoration in the gorgeous italian hills of tuscany during the world war two years of the early s he captivates readers with a deeply emotional story in the vein of the english patient by michael ondaajte ian mcewan’s atonement and other contemporary literary classics spinning a tale of passion art war and betrayal centered around a pair of love triangles and a forged caravaggio read more educator and librarian resources im a teacher im a librarian critical praise “an elegant meditation on the interplay among politics aesthetics and personal ethics it’s also a surprisingly moving story about two women each of whom struggles with grief and guilt as she navigates life during wartime…gently paced and satisfying” — boston globe “olaf’s literary skills bring restoration to life on a windy tuscan hilltop north of florenceand shows the reader the permutations of love betrayed and the enormous losses that war will claim” — shelf awareness “a beautifully realized novel…olafsson masterfully depicts the interior lives of these women creating a richly complex portrait of love and passion at work even as his harrowing depictions of daily life in wartorn italy add additional depth and power to the novel” — library journal “with a backdrop of the ravages of wwii particularly as they affect the civilian population olafsson casts a keen eye on germany’s wartime acquisition of artistic masterpieces a beautifully written literary novel of love betrayal reconciliation and art” — booklist “restoration is an elegantly constructed work of fiction seamlessly moving between the past and the present but what makes olafsson’s novel so compelling is his empathy and compassion for
