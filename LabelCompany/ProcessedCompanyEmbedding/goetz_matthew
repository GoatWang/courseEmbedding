estfacebooktwitterpinterestfacebooktwitterpinterestfacebook dialogpinterestmalin  goetzbefore andrew goetz met matthew malin he relied on one product to do all his grooming—a bar of neutrogena soap im a minimalist at heart remarks goetz who spent ten plus years in the architecture and design field before creating malingoetz malin on the other hand who earned his beauty biz wings working at prestigious companies like kiehls and prada beauty had what goetz called a treasure chest of every product availablebut he couldnt use any of themas a cosmetic buyer—and sales ecutive later on—i had every product available to me however i couldnt use  percent of the products due to my skin issues notes malin whose ailments include rosacea and eczema after both watched the once small familyowned companies they worked for or closely with dissolve into larger conglomerates the two set out to create a line for the simple minimalist world of goetz and —most importantly—a line that malin could actually use we wanted to simplify skin and hair in an industry of overmarketed overcomplicated products regimens and formulas says malin our line has a soulnearly four years later malin  goetz a modern apothecary and lab has established itself as one of manhattans hottest spots for the productobsessed and bareminimum types alike the store isnt just about hype though weve left out potentially irritating colors and artificial scents in our skin care line and all of our moisturizers are oilfree and based on fatty acid technology so they absorb immediately and never clog pores adds goetz while it may not quite be a onebottle fits all philosophy the steadfast staple products like the grapefruit cleanser are appropriate for even the most opposite skin types it works for sensitive dry skin like matthews and for people like myself who tend to be a bit oily states goetzwhile their hard work certainly had a great deal to do with creating a thriving company it seems the real secret to the success of malin  goetz is simple a great partnership andrew is the entrepreneur says malin and without him im not sure i would have taken the leap on my own at the same time we couldnt have accomplished any of this without our joint experiencesclick here for malin  goetzs top beauty picks follow usfacebooktwitterpinterestrecommended for you matthew p goetz md  mayo clinic faculty

summary the research focus of matthew p goetz md is on estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and the development of novel therapeutics for endocrineresistant breast cancer his laboratory and clinical work is funded by the national institutes of health focus areas pharmacogenetics of tamoxifen a notable area of dr goetzs focus has been the pharmacogenetics of tamoxifen out of this work and in collaboration with the developmental therapeutics program of the national cancer institute nci dr goetz has led a team of investigators in the development of a novel formulation of endoxifen hydrochloride for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer the firstinhuman phase i studies of endoxifen hydrochloride started in  at mayo clinic and the nci and a phase ii study of endoxifen began in  within the alliance for clinical trials in oncology with the initial focus being in ai refractory metastatic breast cancer breast cancer genomeguided therapy beauty study dr goetz coleads with judy c boughey md the beauty study which is funded by the mayo clinic center for individualized medicine and the mayo clinic cancer center the goal of this study is to identify novel genetic alterations and changes in cancer pathways both at the time of diagnosis and after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women with highrisk breast cancer in this study both the host and tumor genomes are sequenced prior to therapy after  weeks of paclitaxel and at the time of surgery significance to patient care tamoxifen has been the most important drug for the treatment and prevention of premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer many studies have demonstrated that low endoxifen concentrations in patients with genetic and druginduced reductions in the cypd enzyme are associated with higher rates of breast cancer recurrence because liver metabolism limits the concentrations of endoxifen that can be achieved the direct delivery of endoxifen will allow for achievement of much higher endoxifen concentrations than is currently possible when tamoxifen is delivered using a standard dose a critical element of the beauty study is the development of patientderived xenografts in which patients tumor tissue is kept alive by implanting tumor cells into immunecompromised mice before and after chemotherapy the use of these mouse avatars will allow dr goetz and his colleagues to quickly determine whether the genetic alterations identified by sequencing are functional with the initial focus on studying novel drugs and drug combinations in avatars derived from women with chemotherapy resistance the laboratory studies for beauty are being led by liewei wang md phd and richard weinshilboum md who colead the mayo clinic pharmacogenomics research
