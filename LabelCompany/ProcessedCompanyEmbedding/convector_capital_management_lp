configuration navigation login   welcome convector capital management was founded with a commitment to responsibly manage assets by pursuing superior longterm returns while protecting capital through active risk control  the team behind our firm has applied this principle and associated strategy for over a decade of managing substantial assets  our successful record of dispassionate analysis combined with disciplined portfolio construction has generated investment returns well in excess of market and peer averages our opportunistic value orientated investment philosophy takes advantage of periodic inefficiencies that develop in the valuation of publicly traded securities  therefore our investment positions are differentiated and often contrarian to that of the markets and are generated by specific fundamental analysis informed by deep industry knowledge  we then seek to combine securityspecific insight with disciplined portfolio construction that seeks to minimize potential downside through active risk management  every step of our investment process is augmented by a proprietary technology platform that enhances our ability to identify opportunities and empirically test hypotheses through a comprehensive study of data at convector capital management we invest our own capital alongside that of our clients we do this not only because it is the right business decision to align our interests with those of our clients but also because we fundamentally believe it is the most intelligent approach to managing a significant portion of our own capital
