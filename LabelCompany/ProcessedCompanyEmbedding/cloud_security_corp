startup hackers will still want your information and they’ll still stealthily poke holes in your network wherever they can you need to get security measures in place and fast that’s why “security as a service” companies have become vital for anyone looking to deploy security for everything from documents to your entire business security as a service can be loosely described as a “software as a service” security tool that doesn’t require any onpremise hardware or software distribution unlike older security tools like antivirus software that needs to be installed on every single computer on your network it’s almost plug and play — you click a button and likely put in some credit card information and suddenly you’ve got major security resources at your fingertips these security services aren’t the same as an onpremise firewall that watches the network from a physical appliance attached in your data center but these products promise to protect you from malware help you keep track of who signs into your network monitor all your other cloud applications such as salesforce and google docs and more small businesses can benefit from this kind of distribution model because it doesn’t require a big it or security teams to get it up and running of course you’re trusting a lot of your security to another company but in reality these securityfocused third parties have more resources

remain compliant through its cloudonly solution — no hardware or software required the company analyzes threat information to make sure nothing gets in your system if some malware already happens to be there it will give you the steps to fix the problem beyond that qualys will verify that the issue has been fixed it scans any and all web apps you use for vulnerabilities as well keeping your data safe while you head out in the wonderful world of saas iaas and paas in the future qualys plans to create a cloudonly firewall to even further protect your websites from harm white hat security white hat security is focused on protecting your website from the ground up including in the coding process it provides its sentinel product suite as a service to help your protect your websites with five different products these include a product that gives you current threat information so you can avoid coding vulnerabilities into your website from the get go another helps you identify issues in preproduction before the website is ever launched and its enterprise product helps you test for major logic issues once you’re live the overall sentinel line will help your assess your web apps for holes and will even act as a firewall that virtually patches found problems white hat further takes advantage of its research arm in order to provide you with updated information on threats found outside your network okta one of the most important parts about securing your network is simply knowing who is inside of it okta focuses purely on identity management — knowing who is where and why it knows both your employees for people accessing information on the backend as well as your forwardfacing accessers which include customers and partners it will help you manage logins across all of your applications as well including google apps salesforce workday box sap oracle office  and more furthermore it can track all of these from any type of device features include privilege provisioning from one dashboard the ability to implement policies across devices single signon options and more proofpoint when we talk about attack vectors — holes in the network where bad guys can get in — email pops out as one of the weakest links proofpoint focuses specifically on email with cloudonly services tailored to both enterprises and small to medium sized businesses not only does it make sure none of the bad stuff gets in but it also protects any outgoing data proofpoint further promises that while it stores that data to prevent data loss it does not have the keys to decrypt any of the information zscaler zscaler calls its product the “direct to cloud network” and like many of these products boasts that it’s much easier to deploy and can be much more cost efficient than traditional appliance security the company’s products protect you from advanced persistent threats by monitoring all the traffic that comes in and out of your network as a kind of “checkpost in the cloud” but you don’t have to filter all that traffic in from one central point you can monitor specific local networks as well given the flexibility of the cloud zscaler also protects ios and android devices within your company which can then be monitored through its special mobile online dashboard ciphercloud ciphercloud is here to secure all those other “as a service” products you use such as salesforce chatter box office  gmail amazon web services and more it promises to protect that prized company data you’re just giving away to these services as well as your communications and more it does this through many of the means we’ve already seen including encryption traffic monitoring antivirus scans and more it also provides mobile security support doctrackr doctrackr is a security layer that sits on top of file sharing services such as box and microsoft sharepoint it is built on the idea that once you send a document out of your system it is truly out of your hands people can save it change it send it and more and you’ve lost control of it doctrackr aims to stop that from happening it lets you set user privileges for each person you share a document with it further tracks everyone who opens the file so you know who’s looking at your stuff — and you can even pull documents back effectively “unsharing” them if you want centrify similar to okta centrify also focuses on identity management across a number of devices and applications the idea is to put all of your users — employees and customers alike — into one central area to be monitored and controlled through enforced company policies centrify will protect anywhere a person signs into your network be it through onpremise software or cloud applications it also has a product that works specifically samsung knox — the smartphone manufacturer’s supposedly extraprotected mobile security software this product provides devices running knox with single signon options and helps it departments manage these devices through centrify vaultive vaultive acts as a “transparency network proxy” that is it sits between your network and the internet without needing any onpremise equipment from there vaultive encrypts any data leaving the network heading to apps such as microsoft office  in other words if you want to use cloudbased services but don’t trust the companies operating them you can encrypt everything — before it gets into their servers — while continuing to use their clouds the company plans to help people protect more than just office  and exchange soon it will extend into customer relationship management

and will help you become hipaa and pci compliant — the two compliance measures that regulate how companies dealing with healthcare information and companies accepting online payments must secure their
