the salesperson came to my home in march of  did the presentation and during the walk thru noted that i needed to remove the knob and tube wiring before the insulation could be installed  the electrical work was going to cost a nice penny so i asked if they would honor the quoted discounted price and they said yes  it was actually provider name locked that i spoke to and he was very down to earth and a true professional that cares about providing great customer service  it took me a while to get the electrical done and when i called provider name locked he knew who i was and as promised honored the quote  the installers showed up on time completed the entire job in  hours  let me home inside and out clean  from the first day i could tell there was a noticeable difference in the climate and comfort in my home  they did a great job and i would recommend them to anyone needing this type of service  timothy b copper radiant provider name locked installed professionally in one day  ridge venting installed in one day  no issues with eitherexcept provider name locked did not advise that i should have also had my two turbine vents plugged  most reputable roofers and tons of literature on the internet will advise you to only have one type of attic exhaust system  dont mix them  more vents to not equal better ventilation  in fact multisystems will work against one another  advise you to consult a ventilation expert before considering adding any type of radiant provider name locked   called provider name locked about this and they dont agree with roofing companies or the information out on the internet  they know better  dont risk your home on their narrow thinking  patrick e we were extremely pleased our lge energy audit showed an improvement in the efficiency of our home by  and we received lges  credit they were professional and very knowledgeable however they only do insulation we had another company acn home services llc come do our air
