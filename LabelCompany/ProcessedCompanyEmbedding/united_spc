ncep our mission is to provide timely and accurate forecasts and watches for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes over the contiguous united states the spc also monitors for hazardous winter weather and fire weather events and issues specific products for those hazards we use the most advanced technology and scientific methods available to achieve this goal what is severe weather the nws defines a severe thunderstorm as any storm that produces one or more of the following elements a tornado damaging winds or speeds of  mph  knots or greater hail  inch in diameter or larger the spc further defines significant severe thunderstorms as any storm that produce one or more of the following elements a tornado that produces ef or greater damage wind speeds of 7 mph  knots or greater hail  inch in diameter or larger convective outlooks spc issues day  day  and day  convective outlooks that depict nonsevere thunderstorm areas and severe thunderstorm threats across the contiguous united states along with a text narrative the categorical forecast specifies the level of the overall severe weather threat via numbers eg  descriptive labeling eg high and colors eg magenta the probabilistic forecast directly expresses the best estimate of a severe weather event occurring within  miles of a point the text narrative begins with a listing of severe thunderstorm risk areas by state andor geographic region this is followed by a concise plainlanguage summary of the types of threat along with timing that is focused on the highestrisk areas the rest of the outlook text is written in scientific language for sophisticated users this technical discussion usually includes a synopsis section to provide a general overview of the weather pattern emphasizing features that will influence the severe and general thunderstorm threats additional sections of the discussion are usually separated by geographic areas within these individual geographic areas the text offers meteorological reasoning and justification for the type of coverage and intensity attendant to the severe weather threat spc also issues a day  severe weather outlook that similarly depicts severe thunderstorm threats across the contiguous united states and contains a technical discussion severe weather risks the level of categorical risk in the day  convective outlooks is derived from probability forecasts

outlook two probabilistic thresholds of  and  can be forecast highlighted areas are equivalent to slgtyellow or enhorange risks on the day  convective outlooks on rare occasions the outlook text will begin with a headline for the possibility of a severe weather outbreak if no  areas are forecast one of the following phrases will be used predictability too low used to indicate severe storms may be possible based on some model scenarios however the location or occurrence of severe storms is in doubt due to large spread in model guidance andor minimal runtorun continuity potential too low used to indicate that  or greater severe probabilities appear highly unlikely on that day using the convective outlooks forecasting rare events such as tornadoes and the occurrence of large hail and damaging wind gusts is a difficult process and one that contains a large amount of uncertainty it is important not to rigidly associate the type of risk area eg slgtyellow with the severe potential for any given thunderstorm in the risk area that is just because a slgtyellow risk is forecast does not necessarily mean that the thunderstorms within the risk area will be slightly severe sometimes violent tornadoes occur in slgtyellow enhorange or mdtred risk areas as opposed to highmagenta the reason for this is the synoptic situation producing the violent tornadoes may be confined to a relatively small area or a conditional uncertain situation another slgtyellow risk area may cover several states in which only one or two tornadoes are expected to develop some slgtyellow situations wont involve a threat of tornadoes or supercells but sustained multicell storms with a threat for severe hail and wind damage spc severe weather outlooks forecast events from organized convection eg supercells squall lines and multicell thunderstorm complexes most capable of damage and injury from tornadoes damaging winds or large hail pulsetype thunderstorms consisting primarily of solitary brief severe updrafts often found in environments with weak vertical wind shear are not considered organized convection of this type may not be included in a risk area unless forecaster confidence is high enough to draw a mrgldark green risk since almost any thunderstorm can produce a brief severe weather event it doesnt necessarily mean there is a conflict when a severe thunderstorm warning is issued by a local nws office outside of an spc severe weather risk area in short no two situations are alike even within the same risk category this is why a probabilistic forecast and text discussion accompanies the categorical outlook the probabilities used in the spc convective outlooks are known as subjective probabilities the forecaster makes their best estimate of the probability of an event occurring the probabilities that you see on the graphics represent the probability of one or more events occurring within  miles of a point during the outlook period this definition is used as the probability of severe weather at a given point is quite small how many times have you experienced a tornado in your neighborhood for most people the answer is never now think of how many times severe weather has occurred within  miles of your location its probably safe to say that you can think of some closeby severe weather events you should be able to imagine that the probability of having severe weather occur within such an area is much larger than the probability of having it occur specifically within any one neighborhood how should you interpret probabilistic values the smallest values represent areas where the most uncertainty exists and correspondingly where the smallest expected coverage of storm reports exists the higher the probabilities the greater the perceived threat and the greater the expected coverage of that hazard being forecast the highest probabilities are generally reserved for more significant severe weather events and are used infrequently if at all during the year another way of thinking of the values is related to climatology for example lets assume that the spc forecaster drew a  area for tornadoes which included northwest texas and southwestern oklahoma in midmay the ratio of the forecast to climatology  yields a value of approximately  the spc forecaster is stating they believe the risk of tornadoes in that region is  times larger than climatology by comparing the forecast probability to climatology you can better determine the magnitude of the risk on a given day see the spc severe weather climatology page to find climatological values for where you live the most specific convective outlooks are those issued during the day  period accordingly spc forecasters have the most information available to them to differentiate the threats of the individual severe weather hazards during this period the spc produces probabilistic outlooks for each primary severe weather hazard tornadoes damaging wind and large hail separately by producing separate forecasts for tornadoes damaging wind and large hail the user is given substantially more information upon which to make decisions than in the categorical outlook users who are sensitive to one particular threat eg car dealers and large hail can make more informed decisions since many of the specific details of severe weather forecasting can only be determined hours ahead of time rather than several days the severe weather probabilities for the day  and day  convective outlooks represent the probability of any severe weather hazard large hail damaging wind or tornadoes occurring in addition for tropical cyclones hurricanes tropical storms or depressions the outlooks on day  and day  allow a  total severe probability to be a slgt risk because they are specifically tornadodriven points product the points product for each outlook can be found at a link at the bottom of the day  convective outlooks standard aviation identifier location codes are used to delineate the risk areas on the day  convective outlooks a list of many of these identifiers can be found via ucar when plotted with a line drawn between each point the outlined area forms a polygon the points may either fall exactly on top of the location identifiers ie dalspsgag or may be referenced from those points ie  nw fmy e mia in which case the point would be xx number of nautical miles in the given direction from that point the previous example would read  nautical miles northwest of ft myers fl to  nautical miles east of miami the designator cont is used to indicate that the risk area goes to the us border then starts again at another location on the border for example part of a risk area might say msp inl cont ssm this means the risk area goes from minneapolissaint paul to international falls then comes back in from the canadian border at sault ste marie thunderstorm outlooks spc issues thunderstorm outlooks that depict the probability of thunderstorms across the contiguous united states in  or

protection of life and property since every thunderstorm contains lightning which is a potential killer the enhanced temporal resolution of the spc thunderstorm outlooks aid nws forecasters and partners in timesensitive decisions related to thunderstorms public severe weather outlooks the public severe weather outlook pwo is issued on day  for all category highmagenta risks and mdtred risks that are driven by tornadoes andor damaging winds this plainlanguage forecast is typically issued the morning of the event and is used to alert nontechnical weather users concerned with public safety of a potentially dangerous situation if the probabilities support a pwo issuance on the  utc day  outlook a pwo would be issued by  utc and updated around  utc if the probabilities first support a pwo issuance on the  utc day  outlook the pwo would be issued around  utc and updated around  utc a pwo is also issued following the  utc or  utc day  convective outlook when a  percent or greater probability of significant tornadoes is expected to occur at night mesoscale discussions spc issues mesoscale discussions mds or mcds that focus on severe thunderstorm potential over the continental us for the next  hours with an emphasis on the first  hours spc also issues mds for mesoscale aspects of hazardous winter weather events including heavy snow blizzards and freezing rain all mds contain an areas affected line concerning line valid time a paragraph for a summary and a paragraph for a technical discussion along with a graphical depiction of the highlighted area severe weather md the three types of severe weather mds include development andor evolution of severe convection in relation to watch potential or within valid watches alerting users to an upcoming categorical upgrade in the day  convective outlook a categorical upgrade to the  utc day  convective outlook after the issuance of the  utc day  convective outlook the concerning line of a severe weather md will reference an ongoing watch eg tornado watch 9 or provide a confidence level on the expectation of a watch including the type of watch severe potentialwatch unlikely  or  severe potentialwatch possible  or  severe potentialwatch likely  or 9 severe potentialtornado watch likely  or 9 severe potentialsevere thunderstorm watch likely  or 9 severe potentialwatch needed soon 9 the first paragraph of the md provides a plainlanguage summary that details the forecast severe threat ie timing coverage intensity and mode and resultant spc actions the second paragraph of the md describes the significant mesoscale features and atmospheric processes which will likely result in the expected event generally a severe weather md is written whenever insightful information concerning mesoscale convective developments can be conveyed the md is written concisely and in an understandable style with an emphasis on the mesoscale aspects of the situation severe weather mds provide extra lead time on the severe weather development and allow you to begin gearing up operations before a watch is issued the spc goal is to issue severe potential mds  hours prior to the watch issuance winter weather md winter weather mds focus on the meteorological processes expected to cause hazardous winter weather over the continental us for the next  hours with emphasis on the first  hours the md provides short term forecast information on the what when where and why of the impending weather hazard in the first paragraph the plainlanguage summary contains information concerning expected snowfallprecipitation rates and timing the second paragraph discussion states the mesoscale meteorological processes that can be diagnosed and forecast winter weather mds are usually issued when forecast snowfall rates exceed  per hour below  foot elevation or  per hour in lake effect snowbetween  foot elevation for multiple hours forecast freezing rain rates exceed  in three hours forecast blizzard conditions visibilities less than  mile in snowblowing snow and winds in excess of  mph are expected to last over three hours climatologically anomalous or unexpected events below the aforementioned criteria severe weather watches when conditions become favorable for organized severe thunderstorms or tornadoes to develop the spc issues a severe thunderstorm or tornado watch a tornado can occur in either type of watch but tornado watches are issued when conditions are favorable for either multiple tornadoes or a single intense tornado a severe thunderstorm watch is issued when there is a forecast of organized convection producing at least  total severe weather events watches encourage the general public to stay alert for changing weather conditions and probable warnings for emergency managers storm spotters and the broadcast media watches provide valuable lead time to gear up operations and increase staffing the watch is defined by the counties within a watch that are collaborated with local nws offices therefore some counties in the watch may be outside the parallelogram which approximates the watch area while some counties in the parallelogram may not be in the actual watch issuance a typical watch ranges in size from  to  square miles though some are smaller and others larger depending on the meteorological situation a typical watch duration is  hours but it may be canceled extended in time or space or replaced as required watches are canceled and extended only at local nws offices in consultation with spc a watch is not a warning and should not be interpreted as a guarantee that there will be severe weather spcs goal is to issue watches shortly prior to the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes the goal is to issue the initial severe thunderstorm watch of the day with a lead time of at least  minutes for a tornado watch the lead time goal is  hours for the first tornado event and  hour to the first nontornado severe weather event hail or wind for all watches the lead time should average around  hour for a severe thunderstorm watch and  hours for a tornado watch whenever there is a high confidence forecast of multiple intense tornadoes rated efef spc will highlight a watch with the following pds wording this is a particularly dangerous situation the spc goal is to have  out of every  pds tornado watches verifying with multiple intense tornadoes similar pds wording is used in severe thunderstorm watches when a well defined large bow echo has developed and there is evidence of widespread damaging winds occurring and the bow echo is moving at  mph or greater and downstream conditions suggest the bow echo will be maintained or intensify for the duration of the watch a pds severe thunderstorm watch can also be issued for the anticipation of widespread significant severe weather events convective winds greater than 7 mph andor hail greater than  inches in diameter unfortunately not all severe weather situations are clear cut for example severe weather may be expected if thunderstorms form but there may be doubt about whether storms will develop in such cases spc may wait until storms actually develop before they issue a watch sometimes warnings may precede a watch especially when weaker severe storms develop before the greater severe threat is expected to occur if severe weather develops unexpectedly but is expected to be short lived last less than a couple of hours or is only very isolated a watch probably will not be issued instead the storms would be handled with warnings issued by a local nws office watch issuance products when a watch is issued the following products are disseminated public watch graphic and text watch probability table watch outline update and watch county notification text aviation watch text the public watch graphic available on the spc web site depicts the outline type and valid time of the watch the text provides in plain language the type of watch states affected valid time primary hazards areal approximation precautionaryprepardness actions replacement of other watches if any a short weather discussion and aviation information since not all watches are created equal the primary hazard language is driven by watch probabilities two probabilities for each severe hazard tornadoes damaging winds and hail are included along with the probability of  or more severe events the watch outline update wou contains a listing of all counties in the watch the local nws offices will also issue a watch county notification wcn message that lists the counties in the watch within their area of responsibility once the watch is issued the local offices will issue wcn messages to cancel or add counties or to extend the watch expiration time the wou is updated at least hourly to incorporate the changes made in the wcns in the aviation watch text the storm top numbers are in hundreds of feet so  is  feet the mean storm motion vector is the average expected motion of all the storms in the watch the first  digits are direction the storms will move from on a degree compass and the last two digits are the storms expected forward ground speed in knots so for a vector of  storms are forecast to move from  degrees from the southwest at  knots watch status reports watch status reports are issued at the bottom of each hour between  and  minutes after during the lifetime of each severe thunderstorm andor tornado watch the first status report usually will not be issued until the watch has been in effect for an hour each watch status report uses the distance in statue miles relative to anchor points and to the right of a line for delineating where the severe weather threat continues the watch status lines are drawn from one edge of the watch parallelogram to the other edge the watch status report rarely includes a discussion of the meteorology affecting the watch area as this information will be contained in a mesoscale discussion md the exception may be with the final watch status report where a brief sentence sometimes will be included explaining why the watch will be reissued or allowed to expire fire weather

issued by local nws offices this data is available in multiple formats on this page for each  hour period beginning at  utc on the valid day a graphic and listing of all continental us preliminary severe weather reports that spc received is available since the logging process is automated missing or improperly formatted reports from local nws offices will not get into the database reports may be reclassified as well whats initially reported as a tornado today might be called thunderstorm wind damage a few days later after a survey is done to verify the cause of the damage the log often contains duplicate reports especially of tornadoes when multiple sightings of the same tornado were sent in the local storm reports reports are binned into three categories tornado hail and damaging winds the log is a rough listing of all reports received the final list of reports is found in the storm events database which is compiled by the national climatic data center ncdc a few months after final report lists are submitted by local nws offices there is no guarantee as to the accuracy of spc rough log reports and should be regarded as strictly preliminary the monthly and annual us tornado summaries are updated by spc at irregular intervals the latest us tornado statistics provides a monthly summary of tornadoes by month and contain data for the last four years prel stands for preliminary which should match the spc rough log totals act is the actual number from the storm events database av is average act numbers include removal of any erroneousduplicate reports or added reports which were initially missed or misclassified an  in a column means the data is not yet available there is also a column called yr av that gives the average number of tornadoes per month based on the  years data the number of tornado deaths columns are the number of people killed by month for the years listed and the average killed  years per month the killer tornadoes columns represent killer tornado events for the current year and the year average a tornado is counted as a killer if one or more persons were killed if  people were killed by a single tornado it would be counted as one killer event multiple killer tornadoes on the same day are counted as separate events the annual us killer tornado statistics provides a graphical map of killer tornadoes while current year preliminary us killer tornadoes provides a table listing of killer tornadoes in chronological order the deaths column is number of deaths in the whole tornado path not just at the given location information for the killer tornadoes list comes from local storm reports lsrs and public information statements pns issued by local nws offices supplemented by news from internal nws event memos and internet media accounts since killer tornado information especially death counts circumstances and efscale is often not complete until many days later these numbers are very preliminary and subject to
