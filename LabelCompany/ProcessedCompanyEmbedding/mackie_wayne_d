crystal clear with great range  wow i also have the profx and this is a nice upgrade from thatthe  xlr channels are so great for micing a whole band or just partthe mic channels all have a preamp and four channels of compression allows so much control the two separate monitor sends are extremely useful especially in a full band situation and the effects are subtle but great very happy so far have used it for about  gigs and it has been awesome  awesome mixerwicked price the absolute best mixer easy to use  even easier to set up strongly recommend to any band needing an affordable compact mixer  solid board but the effects are terrible mackie makes pretty durable equipment and it is good enough for live sound i got my board a few days ago and started playing with it i have to say that the builtin effects are terrible there is no way to use any of these i am seriously thinking about returning it but im not sure which board to choose soundcraft allen  heath behringer or yamaha they all have builtin effects  not your fathers mackie different electrical ghost every gig with this thing channels work one week and not the next the mains have gone out twice only to mysteriously work after

quality follow these tips to select the right home audio speakers for your listening needscompare speaker typesfloor speakers when it comes to filling a big room with sound floor speakers cant be beat theyre the largest type of speakers and stand on their own with a pair of left and right speakers you can immerse yourself in a realistic sound experience while watching moviesbookshelf speakers in small and mediumsized rooms bookshelf speakers take up less space and are often small enough to fit inside a cabinet or on a shelf elevating the height rather than placing these speakers on the floor helps to aim the sound right at your ears use them on their own or as part of a surround sound systemcenter channel speakers center channel speakers often sit horizontally and operate on midrange frequencies to deliver clear dialog from movies and tv shows over sound effects and background music center channel speakers provide the best performance when you pair them with other speakers in your home audio systempowered computer speakers if your computer or laptop is the primary source for watching movies playing video games or listening to music then powered computer speakers are a smart choice these spacesaving speakers plug directly into your computer to amplify the sound and improve its qualityevaluate speaker driverstweeters highfrequency drivers that deliver sounds in the frequency spectrum of hz to  hz midrange these drivers produce sounds in the range that falls between tweeters and woofers usually between hz and hz woofers woofers produce sounds in a variety of frequencies in threeway systems woofers produce sounds at frequencies below the midrange drivers in twoway systems woofers produce sounds at frequencies below the tweeters subwoofers these drivers

specifications once you determine what type of speakers you need compare these specs to make a decisionfrequency response — refers to the frequency range that the speaker can produce frequency response is measured in hertz hz human ears can detect sounds between hz and hz and ideal speaker systems cover this range impedance refers to the amount of electrical resistance that an amplifier will encounter when sending audio signals to the speaker impedance is measured in ohms your speakers impedance should match the impedance of your home audio equipment sensitivity refers to how loud a speaker can get per watt of power sensitivity is measured in decibels per watt the higher the sensitivity the less amount of power the speaker needs to achieve high volumes power handling refers to the maximum sound signal that a speaker can handle without causing sound distortion or damage to the speaker power handling is measured in watts speakers should be able to handle the maximum output power of your audio receiver for best resultsconsider speaker placement and acousticsthe placement of the speakers size of the room type of flooring and furniture or other objects in the room can affect the acoustics hard surfaces such as wood paneling hardwood floors and windows tend to reverberate sound which creates audio distortion in contrast soft surfaces such as carpeting rugs and drapes absorb the sound other irregularly shaped surfaces diffuse the sound or cast it in various directions rather than focusing it right on you carefully consider the placement of speakers and other furniture in the room to create the best soundchoose speakers for your home audio systemwhen shopping for speakers consider the type of audio that youll be listening to primarily if youre an audiophile who loves to listen to your music collection the focus on left and right stereo speakers if youre setting up a home theater system to enjoy family movie night then you want to set up surround sound connect several speakers to an audio receiver for a completely immersive sound experiencedont forget the speaker cablesto connect your speakers to your home audio system you need speaker cables and wires be sure to choose highquality cables for speakers positioned far away from the receiver the longer the cable the more the sound quality degrades many speakers use springclip terminals which connect to bare speaker wire highend speakers often have binding post terminals which have threaded jacks that create a secure connection for better sound quality make sure the type of cables and wires you choose are compatible with your speakers and receivershow moreelectrode comp dcproddfw envproda profprod ver shacaabbdbdaddabaff cid
