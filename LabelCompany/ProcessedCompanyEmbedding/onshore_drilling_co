by ground transportation and the drilling site is not over water  many of these wells are now being drilled using a technique called pad drilling where multiple wells are drilled from the same site in very close proximity of each other by shifting the rig slightly  typically these are mature fields pushing the drilling envelope farther to more challenging well formations like new shale fields or very deep wells onshore drilling profiles vary from shallow to deep wellsextended reach to ultraextended reach wellsvertical to deviated wells challenges  onshore drilling has many different challenges related to industry economics equipment used location of the field well profile and formationsrig day rates make running a rig expensive which means that the speed of rigging down moving and rigging up is crucial to guarantee project success drilling equipment has to be reliable and easy to handle on the rig floorthe physical location of the well site sets limits on the size and type of drilling equipment and sometimes the drill string well sites in arctic areas for example have surface equipment and downhole equipment that are exposed to surface temperatures for long periods before use which can impact their performancewell profiles and formations determine drill string requirementshs wells require use of special steels to avoid sulfide stress            crackingwells with drilled depths  ft require the drill pipe in the          upper part of the string will need to have high tensile strengthextended reach wells and ultraextended reach wells can be           difficult to drill because they can be limited by the increased torque           and drag of the drill string in the cutting bed and by the complex          profilessmall clearance wells will drive

from wellhead to burner tipbusiness overviewnatural gas regulationsenvironment  technologyfocus on lngfocus on jobsnatural gas quizyou’ve got shale the “where” and “what” of shale gas formationsold home onshore drilling drilling into the earth in the hopes of uncovering valuable resources is nothing new in fact the digging of water and irrigation wells dates back to the beginning of recorded history at first these wells were primarily dug by hand then by crude stone or wood tools metallurgy brought about the use of iron and bronze tools to delve beneath the earth’s surface and innovations led to more efficient ways of removing debris from the newly dug hole the first recorded instance of the practice of ‘drilling’ holes in the ground came about around  bc when the chinese developed a technique of repeatedly pounding bamboo shoots capped with metal bits into the ground this crude technology was the first appearance of what is known today as ‘percussion drilling’ a method of drilling that is still in use much advancement has been made since these first bamboo drilling implements this section will cover the basics of modern onshore natural gas drilling practices there are two main types of onshore drilling percussion or ‘cable tool’ drilling consists of raising and dropping a heavy metal bit into the ground effectively punching a hole down through the earth cable tool drilling is usually used for shallow low pressure formations the second drilling method is known as rotary drilling and consists of a sharp rotating metal bit used to drill through the earth’s crust this type of drilling is used primarily for deeper wells which may be under high pressure cable tool drilling cable tool or percussion drilling is recognized by many as the first drilling method employed to dig wells into the earth for the purpose of reaching petroleum deposits and water this method is still in use in some of the shallow wells in the appalachian basin although rotary drilling has taken over the bulk of modern drilling activities the basic concept for cable tool drilling consists of repeatedly dropping a heavy metal bit into the ground eventually breaking through rock and punching a hole through to the desired depth the bit usually a blunt chisel shaped instrument can vary with the type of rock that is being drilled water is used in the well hole to combine with all of the drill cuttings and is periodically bailed out of the well when this ‘mud’ interferes with the effectiveness of the drill bit early percussion rigs in pennsylvania – late ’s source office of fossil energy doe cable tool drilling has historically taken many forms in the early days of percussion drilling equipment was very crude compared to today’s technology the ‘springpole’ technique used in the early s consisted of a flexible pole usually a tree trunk anchored at one end and laying across a fulcrum much like a diving board the flexible pole or springpole would have a heavy bit attached at the loose end in order to get the bit to strike the ground workers would use their own body weight to bend the pole toward the ground allowing the bit to strike rock the tension in the pole would spring the bit free in case it became stuck in the ground many improvements have been made since these early percussion rigs in fact it was from cable tool drilling that one of the most important drilling advancements was made in  david and joseph ruffner were using the springpole technique to drill a well in west virginia in order to prevent their well from collapsing they used hollow tree trunks to reinforce the sides of the well and to keep water and mud from entering the well as they dug they are credited as the first drillers to use a casing in their well – an advancement that made drilling much more efficient and easily accomplished it is believed by many that ‘colonel’ drake’s  well achieved success due to the use of steel casing to reinforce the well drake’s well was drilled using steam powered cable tool drilling methods for more information on well casings and well completion click here a modern mobile cable tool drilling rig source anadarko petroleum corporation innovations such as the use of steam power in cable tool drilling greatly increased the efficiency and range of percussion drilling conventional manpowered cable tool rigs were generally used to drill wells  feet or less while steam powered cable tool rigs consisting of the familiar derrick design had an average drilling depth of  to  feet the deepest known well dug with cable tool drilling was completed in  when the new york natural gas corporation drilled a well to a depth of  feet despite the historical significance of cable tool drilling modern drilling activity has shifted mainly toward rotary drilling methods however the foundation of knowledge laid by years of cable tool drilling is in many cases directly transferable to the practice of rotary drilling   horizontal drilling horizontal drilling is flexible in that it allows for the extraction of natural gas that had previously not been feasible  although on the surface it resembles a vertical well beneath the surface the well inclines so that it runs parallel to the natural gas formation these legs can go in different directions at different depths and can be more than one mile long horizontally in addition to the vertical well that can be thousands of feet below the surface  horizontal drilling allows one surface well to branch out underground and tap many different natural gas resources  it also allows the well to make contact with larger areas within productive formations horizontal well and drill source national energy technology laboratory doe   as of result of advances in horizontal drilling natural gas resources in shale basins has been more accessible leading to more diversified sources of natural gas  combining this with other technologies such as seismic imaging has contributed to lower marginal operating and capital costs which in turn allow natural gas producers to more economically extract natural gas from resources horizontal drilling also permits the development of natural resources with minimal aboveground disturbance reducing the environmental footprint of natural gas operations and the cost and potential disturbance of existing roads or other infrastructure  directional drilling and horizontal drilling terms are often used interchangeably  directional drilling refers to drilling at a slant or angle to increase contact with the resource  horizontal

look at ways to build efficient systems at bp “efficient” always means “safe” first i’m encouraged to look beyond the system to consider our colleagues who will actually carry out the job and think about the impact of the work on them the workers are key to any system’s efficiency — so their safety needs to be paramount i am not going to ask them to do anything i would not be willing to do myself if it isn’t safe enough for me it’s not efficient for anyone max davies an outsider to the industry may expect the emphasis on safety to be made along the front lines offshore as a drilling
