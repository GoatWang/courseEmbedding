is with a happy heart that it is with a happy heart that i write of my wonderful experience with foundation financial group during a recent refinancing of my mortgage and primarily my satisfaction and joy was dealing with your very competent employees lauren hill and susannah rubyfrom the very first phone call lauren presented herself as an exceptional professional with seasoned interpersonal skills i had actually been working with another company when i received laurens phone call from foundation financial group i had dealt with and ignored many calls from lending institutions in the several days since i had applied online and was satisfied with the proposal that i had been granted but laurens manner was immediately attractive and she was determined that she could make me a better offer the more i spoke with her the more i realized how much more thorough and knowledgeable she was than the company than i was already working withlauren and susannah spent countless hours on my refinance and often worked well into the evening it was not unusual to receive emails and phone calls at  in the eveningi was particularly touched by the very personal way that they handled a family crisis during the refinance period my elderly mother was in the hospital out of state and i needed to be there there were many documents that your office needed from me in order to continue the process i had no choice but to abandon my end of things and go to ga to care for my mom lauren and susannah were genuinely compassionate and encouraging about the situations i have no doubt that this interruption caused hardships on the timeline that they were working with but they both handled it so gracefully and with genuine concern for my familythe most pleasant part of the work was actually forging a relationship with these two young women putting your finances in the hands of someone whom youve never met could be a daunting process but lauren continued to educate me at every turn she was always contrasting how foundation financial group does the process and emphasizing the thoroughness that each client receives as opposed to some other companies she completely put me at ease with my questions and answered them in a way that a lay person could understandcertainly one expects a strong understanding of the financial endeavors that she is engaged in but lauren offered so much more she was efficient and smart but also so very human and fun i particularly enjoy conversation and often we shared part of our personal lives it was just so easy to relax and know that she was truly motivated to get the best plan for me that she could my expectations of the refinance were exceeded and in a timeline far quicker than i though possiblei spoke with susannah less but again was so very impressed with her abilities she had a delightful sense of humor and it was so fun to relate on a personal level that went beyond the basics of transferring information i think she and lauren have a synergy between them that would put anyone with a financial need at easethank you very kindly for such a stress free experience it was amazing to have the notary even come to my house for the signing of the multitude of papers instead of my going to her also the appraisal team that you selected for the area was equally competent and personableall the way around from the first phone call to laurens very kind personal note of appreciation at the end of the work foundation financial group impressed me on the highest level i will gladly refer anyone that i may to do business with youfoundation

like to say that we were very pleased with the quick and simple process that we encountered with your company and in particular the manager daniel sessions we have refinanced before and it was a long drawnout process and very frustrating so we were hesitant to do it again particularly with an online company however after inquiring online about rates we were contacted by scott from your company almost instantly after scott got all of our information he put us right in contact with his manager daniel who assured us that he would try and get our loan done within  days which we found impressive but not quite believable we did our part getting the papers and verifications to him next day and found him to be very professional and personable when we visited your offices furthermore we were pleasantly shocked when everything went without hassle and we were ready to close in less that that original  day quote we would definitely recommend your company to anyone we speak to about mortgage

financialfrom the beginning you convinced us that foundation financial because of your open truthful consistent and determined efforts was the right choice for us you listened to us confirmed our needs and chose the correct product for us i know that there were a few days during the course of our project where because of my schedule i was a little overtaxed with your requests you remained very professional understanding and helpful never the less and you got us through the process in record timewe were offered very competitive products by our own bank and others but no one else showed the interest in our business and offered as much of themselves as you did megan the savings on the home insurance package you offered nearly  percent off was sensationalthanks again for all your help best

did go in expecting one type of position and received a different type of opportunity something different in terms of my own footprint opportunity vs the traditional stuck the rut count on someone else to make me money accompanied with a capped income kind of situation to boost someone elses bottom line all while busting my buns to try to make their unreasonable biased production quotas to increase their bottom line and eventually leave me out to scuffle for more at retirement no thanks been there done thatwhat this agency is offering is a situation that is flexible with high income and growth potentials no rat race included id rather make my own way than to let a stagnant promise of a falsehope job get in my way when we decide to create our own wealth at our own pace then we have

purchase insurance policies from a company when buying a policy the person agrees to pay a premium which is small regular payment based on the losses that may occur if the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy the premium is usually higher premiums are often paid monthly and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured itemmany types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item the amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible in the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what if the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount the insurance company does not pay anything if the cost is greater than the deductible the policyholder only pays the deductible while the insurance pays the rest generally the deductible amount is related to your premium with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium and viceversainsurance agents selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage this is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most based on their needs and individual risk agents can often give potential customers a quote which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy this is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly credit scores play a major role in insurance scores but past insuranceclaim history is also taken into accountwhile agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance some sell several different types of insurance agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently selling policies from several different insurersinsurance productsalmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all useautomotive insurance millions of americans drive a car to get from place to place each day so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types in most states the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car up to a certain amount most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident its important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others not the policyholder themselves in addition to liability insurance car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident for this purpose liability vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policyinsurance can also be purchased for other vehicles like motorcycles atvs boats or rvs and generally functions similarly to car insurance policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles atvs boats and rvshomeowners insurance your home condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for so it makes sense to get it insured homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policylike auto insurance homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items the primary coverage type is for the dwelling insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it policies may also cover property within the home with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for much like auto insuranceproperty insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control these are known as perils and may include fire flooding natural disasters and other catastrophic events you may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a highrisk area flood insurance is an exception however and can be purchased through the governmentsponsored national flood insurance program your lender may require this if you live in a floodprone areahealth insurance to help pay for medical expenses many people rely on their health insurance with the passing of the affordable care act almost every american is required to enroll in a health care plan or they face a penalty health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance although it is probably used to cover expenses more often since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine health insurance also operates on a premiumdeductible model and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle for example if you visit doctors very infrequently you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible on the other hand people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by lawlife insurance when someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost life insurance comes in two basic types term and universal with a term life insurance plan you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time usually  years or more if you die at any point in that timeframe your family receives a death benefit if youre still around when the term is over the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing universal life covers your entire life and usually delivers a minimum benefit at deathtravel insurance travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel whether its losing luggage or medical treatment abroad travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trippet insurance pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog cat or other domestic animal medical care for animals can be very costly particularly because insurance for them is rare by paying into a premium you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication while virtually unheard of a few years ago pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to riseumbrella insurance umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies usually home or auto insurance consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover for example most car insurance liability policies cover at least  per person or  per accident but if the accident involves a very valuable car or the victim is willing to pursue legal action insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost you may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policyinsurance claims basicsto receive a payout for an insurance policy the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company the basics of the process are straightforward but can vary depending on the type of insuranceclaims adjusters and examiners a claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided an adjuster inspects claims related to property damage as in the case of auto or home insurance policies claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedureshow to make a claim filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses its important to note that in the case of emergencies you should always call  first the safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insuranceauto insurance claim if youre involved in an accident you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation you can file a claim upon obtaining the police report its also a good idea if possible to take your own notes at the scene the most important things to record are what happened before the accident the date and time traffic signs in the area and road conditions also be sure to get the other drivers name address license plate number and insurance information even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process once you have this documentation call your insurance company right away homeowners insurance claim in the case of damage take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible if any of your possessions were damaged use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim once an adjuster has made their own report review it for accuracy life insurance claim send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan as well as a certified copy of the policyholders death certificate with the proper information life insurance claims are generally straightforward problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy in this case an attorney may be needed to settle the claimfinding discounts on insuranceinsurance is a wise investment but it can make a dent in your monthly budget thankfully there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you needshop and compare perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible even after youve chosen a plan and started paying into it consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy while traditional agents can still find a good deal independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs the internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before potential customers can often get free quotes online very quicklybuy only what you need insurance agents will often try to upsell on various extra products that may be useful for certain people but are generally excessive for the average consumer stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs for example if the annual cost of your auto insurance is  percent or more of the total value of your car drop all but the most essential coverage this is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings otherwise you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash it can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policytake advantage of discounts insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances in one of the most basic discounts many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home auto and life insurance policies from the same provider car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course for those with teenagers on their plan good grades can earn a small discount as well insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel federal employees teachers first responders and their families we just redesigned ypcom do you

with a happy heart that it is with a happy heart that i write of my wonderful experience with foundation financial group during a recent refinancing of my mortgage and primarily my satisfaction and joy was dealing with your very competent employees lauren hill and susannah rubyfrom the very first phone call lauren presented herself as an exceptional professional with seasoned interpersonal skills i had actually been working with another company when i received laurens phone call from foundation financial group i had dealt with and ignored many calls from lending institutions in the several days since i had applied online and was satisfied with the proposal that i had been granted but laurens manner was immediately attractive and she was determined that she could make me a better offer the more i spoke with her the more i realized how much more thorough and knowledgeable she was than the company than i was already working withlauren and susannah spent countless hours on my refinance and often worked well into the evening it was not unusual to receive emails and phone calls at  in the eveningi was particularly touched by the very personal way that they handled a family crisis during the refinance period my elderly mother was in the hospital out of state and i needed to be there there were many documents that your office needed from me in order to continue the process i had no choice but to abandon my end of things and go to ga to care for my mom lauren and susannah were genuinely compassionate and encouraging about the situations i have no doubt that this interruption caused hardships on the timeline that they were working with but they both handled it so gracefully and with genuine concern for my familythe most pleasant part of the work was actually forging a relationship with these two young women putting your finances in the hands of someone whom youve never met could be a daunting process but lauren continued to educate me at every turn she was always contrasting how foundation financial group does the process and emphasizing the thoroughness that each client receives as opposed to some other companies she completely put me at ease with my questions and answered them in a way that a lay person could understandcertainly one expects a strong understanding of the financial endeavors that she is engaged in but lauren offered so much more she was efficient and smart but also so very human and fun i particularly enjoy conversation and often we shared part of our personal lives it was just so easy to relax and know that she was truly motivated to get the best plan for me that she could my expectations of the refinance were exceeded and in a timeline far quicker than i though possiblei spoke with susannah less but again was so very impressed with her abilities she had a delightful sense of humor and it was so fun to relate on a personal level that went beyond the basics of transferring information i think she and lauren have a synergy between them that would put anyone with a financial need at easethank you very kindly for such a stress free experience it was amazing to have the notary even come to my house for the signing of the multitude of papers instead of my going to her also the appraisal team that you selected for the area was equally competent and personableall the way around from the first phone call to laurens very kind personal note of appreciation at the end of the work foundation financial group impressed me on the highest level i will gladly refer anyone that i may to do business with youfoundation

like to say that we were very pleased with the quick and simple process that we encountered with your company and in particular the manager daniel sessions we have refinanced before and it was a long drawnout process and very frustrating so we were hesitant to do it again particularly with an online company however after inquiring online about rates we were contacted by scott from your company almost instantly after scott got all of our information he put us right in contact with his manager daniel who assured us that he would try and get our loan done within  days which we found impressive but not quite believable we did our part getting the papers and verifications to him next day and found him to be very professional and personable when we visited your offices furthermore we were pleasantly shocked when everything went without hassle and we were ready to close in less that that original  day quote we would definitely recommend your company to anyone we speak to about mortgage

did go in expecting one type of position and received a different type of opportunity something different in terms of my own footprint opportunity vs the traditional stuck the rut count on someone

increase their bottom line and eventually leave me out to scuffle for more at retirement no thanks been there done thatwhat this agency is offering is a situation that is flexible with high income and

purchase insurance policies from a company when buying a policy the person agrees to pay a premium which is small regular payment based on the losses that may occur if the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy the premium is usually higher premiums are often paid monthly and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured itemmany types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item the amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible in the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what if the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount the insurance company does not pay anything if the cost is greater than the deductible the policyholder only pays the deductible while the insurance pays the rest generally the deductible amount is related to your premium with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium and viceversainsurance agents selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage this is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most based on their needs and individual risk agents can often give potential customers a quote which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy this is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly credit scores play a major role in insurance scores but past insuranceclaim history is also taken into accountwhile agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance some sell several different types of insurance agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently selling policies from several different insurersinsurance productsalmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all useautomotive insurance millions of americans drive a car to get from place to place each day so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types in most states the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car up to a certain amount most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident its important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others not the policyholder themselves in addition to liability insurance car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident for this purpose liability vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policyinsurance can also be purchased for other vehicles like motorcycles atvs boats or rvs and generally functions similarly to car insurance policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles atvs boats and rvshomeowners insurance your home condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for so it makes sense to get it insured homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policylike auto insurance homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items the primary coverage type is for the dwelling insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it policies may also cover property within the home with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for much like auto insuranceproperty insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control these are known as perils and may include fire flooding natural disasters and other catastrophic events you may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a highrisk area flood insurance is an exception however and can be purchased through the governmentsponsored national flood insurance program your lender may require this if you live in a floodprone areahealth insurance to help pay for medical expenses many people rely on their health insurance with the passing of the affordable care act almost every american is required to enroll in a health care plan or they face a penalty health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance although it is probably used to cover expenses more often since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine health insurance also operates on a premiumdeductible model and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle for example if you visit doctors very infrequently you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible on the other hand people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by lawlife insurance when someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost life insurance comes in two basic types term and universal with a term life insurance plan you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time usually  years or more if you die at any point in that timeframe your family receives a death benefit if youre still around when the term is over the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing universal life covers your entire life and usually delivers a minimum benefit at deathtravel insurance travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel whether its losing luggage or medical treatment abroad travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trippet insurance pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog cat or other domestic animal medical care for animals can be very costly particularly because insurance for them is rare by paying into a premium you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication while virtually unheard of a few years ago pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to riseumbrella insurance umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies usually home or auto insurance consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover for example most car insurance liability policies cover at least  per person or  per accident but if the accident involves a very valuable car or the victim is willing to pursue legal action insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost you may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policyinsurance claims basicsto receive a payout for an insurance policy the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company the basics of the process are straightforward but can vary depending on the type of insuranceclaims adjusters and examiners a claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided an adjuster inspects claims related to property damage as in the case of auto or home insurance policies claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedureshow to make a claim filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses its important to note that in the case of emergencies you should always call  first the safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insuranceauto insurance claim if youre involved in an accident you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation you can file a claim upon obtaining the police report its also a good idea if possible to take your own notes at the scene the most important things to record are what happened before the accident the date and time traffic signs in the area and road conditions also be sure to get the other drivers name address license plate number and insurance information even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process once you have this documentation call your insurance company right away homeowners insurance claim in the case of damage take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible if any of your possessions were damaged use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim once an adjuster has made their own report review it for accuracy life insurance claim send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan as well as a certified copy of the policyholders death certificate with the proper information life insurance claims are generally straightforward problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy in this case an attorney may be needed to settle the claimfinding discounts on insuranceinsurance is a wise investment but it can make a dent in your monthly budget thankfully there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you needshop and compare perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible even after youve chosen a plan and started paying into it consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy while traditional agents can still find a good deal independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs the internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before potential customers can often get free quotes online very quicklybuy only what you need insurance agents will often try to upsell on various extra products that may be useful for certain people but are generally excessive for the average consumer stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs for example if the annual cost of your auto insurance is  percent or more of the total value of your car drop all but the most essential coverage this is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings otherwise you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash it can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policytake advantage of discounts insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances in one of the most basic discounts many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home auto and life insurance policies from the same provider car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course for those with teenagers on their plan good grades can earn a small discount as well insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel federal employees teachers first responders and their families we just redesigned ypcom do you
