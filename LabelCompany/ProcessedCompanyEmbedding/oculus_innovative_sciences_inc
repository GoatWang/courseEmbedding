new products with a cumulative  prescriptions filled  with this foundation we are more confident than ever that our plan is bearing fruit and will result in continued and sustainable growth in the dermatology market” said oculus ceo jim schutz  “regarding the rest of world revenue growth in latin america this past quarter fell from normal ranges due to a decline of the mexican peso and our partner’s consolidation of their warehouses causing a quarterly reduction in units sold” results for the twelve months ended march   oculus reported gross profit of  million or  of revenue for the twelve months ended march   compared to a gross profit of  million or  of revenue for the same period in the prior year the decrease in overall gross profit was caused by a decline in license and royalty revenues which had higher margins than the product revenue for the twelve months ended march   oculus reported product gross profit of  million or  compared to product gross profit of  million or  for the same period in the prior year the increase in product gross profit was primarily related to improved margins in the united states as a result of the launch of higher margin dermatology

product revenue in the united states was  million for the three months ended march   as compared to  in the quarter ended march   product revenues increased  or  sales increased primarily due

to fill their expansive pharmacy store network in addition there was a decline in local currency sales in the quarter ended march   as a result of warehouse consolidations during the quarter ended march   sanfer closed a number of the former more pharma warehouses reducing the need for new product units    for the three months ended march   and  product licensing fees and royalty revenues were
