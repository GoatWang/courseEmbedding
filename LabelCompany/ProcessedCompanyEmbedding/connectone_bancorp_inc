develop business relationships by increasing our profile in our communities in the financial services industry in recent years intense market demands technological and regulatory changes and economic pressures have eroded industry classifications that were once clearly defined as a result of increased competition existing banks have been forced to diversify their services increase rates paid on deposits and become more cost effective corresponding changes in the regulatory framework have resulted in increasing homogeneity in the financial services offered by financial institutions some of the results of those market dynamics in the financial services industry include an increase in the number of new bank and nonbank competitors and increased customer awareness of product and service
