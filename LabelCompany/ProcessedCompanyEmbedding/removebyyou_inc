first lets discuss the methods that are performed in a doctors office family physicians and dermatologists frequently remove skin tags occasionally a cosmetic surgeon gynecologist or ophthalmologist will remove one depending on the location the three ways doctors remove skin tags is by cutting them off burning them or freezing them skin tags can be cut off with a scalpel or medical shears they can be burned off with a medical cautery device or they can be frozen with liquid nitrogen in which case the skin tag then falls off in all three instances the idea is to stop the blood flow to the skin tag in some cases such as a large growth or multiple skin tags within a small area a local anesthesia may be used usually no anesthesia is required please be aware that having a doctor remove skin tags is usually not covered by medical insurance because it is considered an elective procedure how to remove skin tags at home there are also ways that you can remove skin tags by yourself at home again all three methods involve stopping blood flow to the skin tag  you can cut off a skin tag with a pair of sterilized scissors with this method there are immediate results as the skin tag is instantly removed however there can be bleeding especially if removing a large skin tag personally i cringe at the thought of doing this myself  you can also cut off blood flow to the skin tag by tying thread or dental floss around the skin tag after a few days of blood deprivation the skin tag will dry up and fall off  you can use an overthecounter product that removes skin tags this is the method i prefer when looking for a product i recommend using one that is  natural and that does not contain any bloodroot bloodroot is a natural substance that can be used to remove skin tags but it can also have negative side effects i use wart  mole vanish to remove any skin tags and moles that develop on my skin because its  natural and doesnt contain any bloodroot ive written a wart  mole vanish review where i include photos so you can see the process ive recently discovered another skin tag remover as well it doesnt work as fast as wart mole vanish but it is a cheaper alternative other info about removing skin tags  its a myth that removing skin tags will cause more to grow back in its place there is no evidence to support this assertion removing a skin tag will not cause more to grow back its simply the case that some are more prone to getting skin tags than others and they may get more skin tags as they get older  sometimes a skin tag may fall off by itself without any pain or discomfort this can happen if a skin tag twists itself at the stalk thereby cutting off its blood supply   skin tag remove skin tags cut off skin tags thread or dental floss freeze skin tags

opportunity for the company to continue as a going concern while the company believes in the viability of its business strategy and in its ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances

financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting policies in the united states gaap except as otherwise disclosed all dollar figures included therein and in the following management discussion and analysis are quoted in united states dollars operations we incorporated on november   and acquired a unique allnatural product formula to be used with a regimen of homecare microneedle devices to remove unwanted tattoos through a diy or doityourself program most of our activity through october   involved the implementation of our business plan acquisition of our allnatural product formula refinement and development of our diy program testing of suggested use patterns procedures utilizing standard homecare microneedle devices along with the allnatural product formula for tattoo removal and of course efforts in preparation of the completed offering we are a development stage company and have extremely limited financial resources we have not established a source of equity or debt financing our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in their report emphasizing the uncertainty of our ability to remain a going concern we have not generated revenues from our operations and are considered a development stage company as that term is defined by financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standards codification asc  development stage entities removebyyou inc the company or rmov is in the business of developing a unique diy program for effective tattoo removal that will be easy to do and removed by you the consumer every day thousands of individuals potential consumers suffer from skin damage because of painful risky expensive laser andor dermabrasion procedures to remove tattoos rmov owns the rights to certain intellectual property the removebyyou system which it believes to be a safe and effective process rmov intends to improve on the development of its simple removebyyou tattoo removal solution providing a user with the ability to  cease worriment and the constant need to cover unwanted tattoos with clothing or camouflage concealer  stop others from staring at embarrassing and unwanted tattoos  say goodbye to unwanted names or inked statements ever from their bodies and  look professional without the fear and stigma of ink popping out when a collar or shirt sleeve moves in addition we believe the removebyyou system will provide the consumer with an alternative tattoo removal product that does not contain potentially harmful chemicals as its components we believe the removebyyou system a unique doityourself program will provide consumers with allnatural product based formula made of essential oils and various natural ingredients that nourish the skin and focus its effect on macrophage with tattoos insoluble pigments are buried within the inner layers of the skin under a microscope these appear as tiny color granules or pigment these granules are located in the skin cell known as the macrophage the skins macrophage normally removes foreign objects such as bacteria and other unwanted invaders with ease granules of color or pigment the basis for tattoos freezes the macrophage cell so it cannot remove foreign objects which normally it would do on its own as a result granules of color or pigment remain in the skin and the tattoo becomes permanent we believe with the use of the allnatural product based formula used in the removebyyou system the macrophage is activated and through continuous treatments gradually starts to fade the granules of color or pigments naturally and effectively unwanted tattoos fade over a series of treatments and ink granules of color or pigment particles are carried away by the bodys lymphatic system our plan to continue as a going concern is to reach a point where we begin generating revenue from our removebyyou system to meet our financial obligations on a timely basis in the early stages of operations we will keep costs to a minimum we intend to introduce a product offering gradually beginning sometime early in  however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving or adhering to this schedule the cost to develop our product offering could very well be in excess of  we will need an additional  to  to purchase raw materials for inventory including homecare microneedle devices packaging design increased product testing introduction of effective stylish marketing and advertising programs that educate and excite consumers  our only source of capital at this time is investment by others in our completed offering there are no circumstances under which we are required to remit remuneration to mr markward for his services the company must certainly raise additional capital or debt financing in order to implement its business strategy upon becoming publicly traded we will contact private equity funds angel investors and others known to our president and various professionals with whom we deal with in order to secure the necessary financing as stated throughout this report in order to develop products and services the company will need to seek additional capital through debt or equity the company believes that if we can secure at least  or more of its financing requirements we should be able to move forward with various phases of our business plan management believes that if we are successful in raising the necessary funds of which there can be no assurances we may be able to generate limited revenue within  months of receiving those funds while we hope that we will be successful in these efforts additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements in order for us to execute our business plan we must seek additional financing beyond the proceeds from our completed offering our plans to execute the business are limited until we seek sufficient additional financing the proceeds from the completed offering are a necessary step in execution however critical to the following timeline is the necessity to seek and secure additional financing if and when we obtain the required financing we should be able to undertake our business plan through the following phases or stages at some point we will seek to hire employees or fully engage outside consultants to enhance the skills and services of our founder in the execution of the business plan as mentioned above these costs could very well be in excess of

likely not be able to meet or achieve our timeline objectives according to the schedule set forth above if we complete   or even  of our additional financing objectives we may not be able to pursue any of our timeline goals or action steps due to the fact that we will not be able to hire or obtain the necessary resources to carry out each phase of development and will have to defer pursing the next stage of business or consider an alternative means to accomplish each stage of development which will take longer than initially planned in that case the company will be forced to proceed piecemeal using only the services of our president and chief executive officer and limited use of outside contractors when and if limited funds are obtained our president and chief executive officer on average will devote at least  hours a week to our continued business efforts there is no realistic way to predict the timing or completion of our business plan based upon those scenarios if we are unable to raise the necessary levels of financing in the event we are unable to raise additional funds beyond the completed offering proceeds we will not be able to pursue our business plan or timeline objectives and the company may fail entirely it is our plan to seek financing from other equity financings or through debt instruments these efforts will most likely occur in the next six to twelve months management will through relationships continue to work on and refine product formulas as well as pursue other skincare product development that may be necessary and appropriate for use in tattoo removal and general healing necessary for the skin completing these tasks will require hiring employees andor outside consultants sophistication as well as precision expertise our founder has as well as skincare professionals that he personally knows the company will strive to make progress in product development and eventually achieve sales of intended products but currently no timeframe can be ascertained most if not all of these actions are predicated on the company obtaining necessary financing to accomplish these steps if financing is not available on reasonable terms then progression steps of the business plan will not occur and may never occur we currently have no sources of financing and no commitments for financing we will seek to obtain the necessary financing by contacting potential funding sources known to the professional and business contacts of our president there are no assurances that we will obtain sufficient financing or resources to enter into agreements with product manufacturers developers or salesmarketing firms we do not have any cash or other resources to commence the use of outside consultants if we do not receive funding or financing we believe our business could be maintained with limited operations for at least  months because our president has agreed to provide his services without compensation accrued or otherwise and rely on shortterm loans from friends and family members however failure to obtain financing from other sources would impair our ability to implement our plans and likely result in the company ceasing operations we do not currently have a formal agreement in place with our president covering this period however our presidents plan and business philosophy is to provide substantially all of our administrative and planning work as well as basic product formulationproduction and marketing work on his own without cash compensation while he seeks other sources of funding we do not have any plans to accrue compensation for services and our president who is also management of the company agrees with that action while we will seek other sources of financing we do not have any formal plans or agreements in place to receive short term financing from our president his friends or family members to date this financing has been as needed for working capital purposes business our goal is to develop a targeted business based on a series of an allnatural branded skincare product utilizing a regimen of homecare microneedle device procedures marketed under the removebyyou brand our goal is to develop manufacture and market a line of quality products which includes our removebyyou tattoo removal system and other support products we will ultimately use independent marketing professionals to gain introduction to our target market our target market will consist of men and women seeking an allnatural based product with the ability and predictability to remove their unwanted tattoo without harm to their skin or body nearly  million people in the united states sport tattoos and it is believed that half of them will regret getting their tattoos as a result laser procedures for tattoo removal have become one of the fastest growing areas of the dermatology industry approximately  percent of laser procedures performed annually were for tattoo removal we believe we can provide a safe and allnatural alternative to laser procedures as well as caustic chemical processes we have not entered into any contract nor approached any industry or marketing consultants or independent contractors to assist us in this target market we currently have no sources of financing and no commitments for financing there are no assurances that we will obtain sufficient financing or resources to enter into agreements with independent contractors manufacturers distributors or marketing firms  products we are developing a skincare product targeted at the tattoo wearing public that later regrets the decision to get a tattoo we hired an independent cosmetics formulator for the express purpose of assisting in the initial development of our unique allnatural product formula which consists of a complex blend of  different raw materials which became the foundation of the diy removebyyou system these materials contain antioxidant properties that are believed by many to help fight free radical damage caused by sunlight stress and other environmental factors as well as assisting with the bodys natural healing process we hired an experienced practicing acupuncturist to assist with designing the specific procedures or rolling patterns that comprises a regimen that employs the use of homecare microneedle devices in the preparation of the skin and the macrophage microneedling procedures and our allnatural based product formula were selected for its combined efficacy in helping correct existing skin damage caused by tattoos as well as agerelated signs such as wrinkles reduced firmness and poor elasticity of the skin our goal is to develop a line of skincare products that use allnatural renewable ingredients desired by our target market users and incorporation into their skincare regimen our discussions with the independent cosmetics formulator and practicing acupuncture professional have been limited and we currently do not have a legallybinding or any other formal agreement with either of them if an agreement is reached with either of them in the future we believe that they will provide for their services to be billed hourly manufacturing we do not intend to manufacture our products in our own facilities rather we intend to outsource the manufacture of our products to one or more independent manufacturers that also manufacture skincare products for a number of other skincare businesses the manufacturer will be expected to test our product formulations and conduct quality control in all aspects of manufacturing during this testing we expect to be making further adjustments to our formulations while we believe that we may be able to contract or engage a manufacturer to perform these functions we may not be able to do so as discussed above we will modify our plan of operations in a manner consistent with our atthattime financial situation we currently have no arrangements with a manufacturer marketing and distribution we intend to seek arrangements at least initially with tattoo parlors or other skincare retailers in the us for the initial sale of our products we intend to pursue exclusive relationships as a product provider that is allnatural and safe for tattoo removal these efforts will be undertaken with the assistance of marketing professionals we currently have no arrangements with any marketing professional however we have had discussions with a limited number of distributors of consumer goods and other skincare products we will need to determine product differentiation placement terms and pricing anticipated order quantities and labeling requirements we anticipate that we will have completed our initial manufacturing and packaging of products early in  provided that we obtain the necessary financing there are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining financing or in completing the development of our products within this timeframe or otherwise industry making tattoos disappear is a multibillion dollar business and growing as unemployment continues to plague the united states economy and job hunters are required to be competitive coveringup or removing tattoos is essential adding to this among those already working many are forced to hide their permanent colorful skin decorations as a way to maintain a professional image others who are tattooed are not motivated by professional concerns but by personal taste they may have simply fallen outoflove with their tattoos or outoflove with the name of the person indelibly inked on their skin seemingly forever it is not employees who choose to display their tattoos at work and still love them are finding that the rules of the workplace are gradually and regretfully becoming more strict when it comes to appearance businesses are indirectly forcing employees to hide their tattoos with clothing bandages or even coverups for example pier imports bath  body works employees can be terminated for exposing tattoos while on the job legal firms accounting firms investment banks and even upscale retailers might not want their employees to flaunt their ink this is even the case when it comes to more untraditional professions such as cheerleading or dance where style and policy has reversed towards a natural skin image a famous football cheerleading squad required their cheerleaders have an official coverup for their tattoos  for which they used a temporary product called smartcover to help while performing  tattoo removal is the focus the removebyyou system is our passion to the industry and its needs consumer demand requires expertise and is willing to pay for it tattoo removal businesses are at the forefront of an exploding industry ranging from laser removal to chemical caustic removal to alternative methods consisting of various lotions and creams with devices that are meant to accelerate the bodys lymphatic system like the removebyyou system according to an online poll of  united states citizens conducted in  by the harris poll currently one in five adults has at least one tattoo  which is up from the  and  who reported having a tattoo when this question was asked in  and  respectively that is  million people bearing ink a more recent poll on behalf of nbc news and the wall street journal found that  percent of respondents reported having a tattoo and in a companion survey  percent said someone in their household had a tattoo up from  percent in  the trend seems to be most prevalent in the western united states  of adults in that region report having at least onecompared to fewer in the eastern united states  midwest  and southern united states  adults aged  are most likely to have a tattoo  compared to both those younger  of those  and  of those  and older  of those   of those  and just  of those  and older women are slightly more likely than men for the first time since this question was first asked to have a tattoo now  versus  source the harris poll® number  february   among those with a tattoo most have never regretted getting a tattoo  and three in ten say it makes them feel more sexy  onequarter say having a tattoo makes them feel rebellious   say both it makes them feel attractive or strong  say it makes them feel spiritual and fewer say it makes them feel more healthy  intelligent  or athletic  however among those without tattoos the opinions differ · at least two in five say that people with tattoos are less attractive  or sexy  · onequarter say that people with tattoos are less intelligent  healthy  or spiritual  · however having a tattoo seems to make little difference in nontattooed peoples perceptions regarding strength and athleticism  say it makes no difference yet · half of those without a tattoo say people with tattoos are more rebellious  this idea connecting tattoos with rebelliousness is not new however it may be waning in  among all adults whether or not they had a tattoo almost three in ten said that people with tattoos are more likely to do something most consider deviant  while  said people with tattoos were less likely to do something deviant and  said it made no difference at all today the number of people who say adults with tattoos are more likely to do something people consider deviant has dropped to  and the number of people who say it makes no difference has gone up to  looking at other forms of body art or expression currently  of adults have pierced ears which is consistent with the  who reported having pierced ears in  although ear piercing is fairly common other piercings are not only  say they have a piercing elsewhere on their body and  report having a facial piercing not on the ear only  of adults say that they currently have a henna or nonpermanent tattoo although tattoos may be gaining popularity or at least frequency among adults the majority think that one should be an adult before being able to get a tattoo of adults say that young people should be between  and  years of age before they are able to get a tattoo without parental permission  think those  or  should be allowed to get tattoos and  say that the age limit should be  years or older tattoos have long been a hobby for some and with the recent proliferation of tattoorelated television shows it seems interest in them may be broadening today  of adults report having a tattoo which is up from previous years it seems that with the increasing number of adults with tattoos this permanent body art is becoming more accepted  fewer people think it is related to deviant behavior than before  yet among those without tattoos there are still several negative stigmas associated with having tattoos it will be interesting to see how these trends evolve in the future  if more people continue to get tattoos will the negative connotations decline or will the percentage of americans with tattoos begin to stagnate or wane and the stigmas hold either way every year millions of adults are added to the rolls of tattooing wearing users  table   who has tattoos sample all adults                       all adults          region             east          midwest          south          west          age

      yes          no          indeed an estimated  in  of all  to yearolds have at least one tattoo the biggest complaint among tattoo wearers according to the food and drug administration is dissatisfaction with their tattoo or their decision to get their tattoo usually at a turning point in their life weve had a big increase across the board in people seeking tattoo removal says one physician who removes tattoos with laser assisted devices in the midatlantic region we  see more women than men nearly  million adults sport tattoos and almost half end up regretting the tattoo according to a national survey despite the harris poll which reports that  of respondents with tattoos do not have any regrets as a result laser assisted procedures for tattoo removal is becoming one of the fastest growing areas of the dermatology industry with alternatives both medical device assisted and nonmedical device assisted to laser assisted procedure removed tattoo services coming in a close second without the myriad of federal and state regulatory compliance and oversight in the use of laser assisted devices in order to remove those unwanted tattoos approximately  percent of all laser assisted procedures performed over the past  months were specific to tattoo removal according to a national survey we believe these statistics are equally representative of the global market our focus for the near term is the us market competition the tattoo removal business has grown quickly from  with revenues expanding at an average annual rate of more than  to  million in annual revenues in  increased social acceptability of and interest in tattoos has driven the demand which ultimately increased the pool of potential customers ie tattoo removal consumers who may regret their initial decision and want their tattoos removed further pushing growth has been the post recession says industry analyst justin molavi with heightened unemployment increasing demand from job seekers who wanted to cover up tattoos to improve their job prospects at the same time the recession caused disposable income to decline which mitigated overall growth because it limited consumers ability to pay for their tattoo removal innovation has been a key focus in the tattoo removal business with increasing use of qswitching laser technology to remove tattoos which allows less patient evasiveness and scarring according to molavi this move has not only resulted in higher demand for tattoo removal since consumers generally prefer this method but also supported demand for tattoos because people now see how relatively easy it is to remove them with this method in comparison to other methods used by the industry industry players purchased this technology at accelerating rates to meet demand from customers who demanded tattoo removal  management believes the industry will continue to grow over the next five years albeit slower although demand will remain high given the ease of removal with laser assisted technology the boost in demand that resulted from high unemployment will fade as the united states economy gains steam and unemployment declines the absence of the high growth experienced during the recent past will result in fewer new entrants although existing companies such as medermis laser clinic laseraway and the dr tattoff franchise business only comprise a small share of the tattoo removal business revenue they continue to increase market share through geographical expansion it is believed that most tattoo removal business will come from the southeastern western and midatlantic regions of the united states due to their higher population densities and the presence of major metropolitan areas while we are not a laser assisted technology tattoo removal business we consider them our direct competitors along with the large skincare manufacturers due to our all natural ingredient product formula we will compete using industry contacts to develop opportunities meet prospective distributors that we will partner with and quickly as our limited resources permit these opportunities will come from contacts and referrals that we make through our independent consultants and our president the ability to take advantage of these opportunities will depend upon our ability to secure sufficient funding for our product development and manufacturing and marketing and advertising professionals however we cannot predict the likelihood or timing for our success no assurances can be given that our competitive strategy will have any success other as a corporate policy we will not incur cash obligations that we cannot satisfy with known resources of which there are currently none except for legal fees which will become due and payable upon completion of the offering we will not incur any significant obligations that need to be satisfied with cash payments in the shortterm unless we have a secure funding source to pay the obligations when due we believe that the perception that many people have of a public company may make it more likely that they will accept restricted securities from a public company as consideration for indebtedness owed to them than they would from a private company we have not performed any studies of this matter managements belief is based solely on advice and informal consultation with various professionals who are known to us and have public company experience these discussions have led us to believe that being a public company may afford the business management and its shareholders with a higher degree of recognition than would be typically attained as a small private or nonpublic company and may increase its ability andor options to obtain financing for growth in addition by being a public company we believe increases our future opportunities to raise funds or to pay vendors by issuing restricted common stock rather than cash however there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts even if we are a public entity additionally issuance of restricted shares would necessarily dilute the percentage of ownership interest of our stockholders recently

shareholder is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest item a  risk factors the following risk factors should be considered in connection with an evaluation of our business in addition to other information in this quarterly report filed on form q the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business operating results liquidity and financial condition  as a result of the risk factors set forth below actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impact our business operating results liquidity and financial condition  if any such risks occur our business operating results liquidity and financial condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner under such circumstances if and when a trading market for our securities is established the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment rmov has virtually no financial resources our independent registered auditors report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern rmov is an early stage company and has virtually no financial resources as of august   we had a negative working capital balance of  and an accumulated deficit of  our independent registered auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion on our financial statements as of and for the period ended november   that the companys losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern no assurances can be given that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue or obtain necessary financing to continue as a going concern rmov is and will continue to be completely dependent on the services of our founder and president kyle markward the loss of whose services may cause our business operations to cease in addition the lack of industry specific experience by our founder and president may be insufficient for our success rmovs operations and business strategy are completely dependent upon the knowledge and business connections of mr markward he is under no contractual obligation to remain employed by us if he should choose to leave us for any reason or if he becomes ill and is unable to work for an extended period of time before we have hired additional personnel our operations could fail even if we are able to find additional personnel it is uncertain whether we could find someone who could develop our business along the lines described in this report we could fail without the services of mr markward or an appropriate replacements we intend to acquire keyman life insurance on the life of mr markward naming us as the beneficiary when and if we obtain the resources to do so and if he is insurable we have not yet procured such insurance and there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future our founder mr markward despite his business experience has limited experience in the skincare industry mr markward has no prior experience in the public markets financial reporting or with the registration process financial markets in order to compensate for the lack of experience the company and mr markward enlisted the aid of three seasoned professional consultants that work in the skincare industry these consultants are readily available to the company mr markward has identified his lack of experience in both industry and the financial markets as an area the company needs to support and enhance in the nearterm there can be no assurance that the company will be able to overcome the lack of experience by mr markward and achieve its business objectives  rmov will need to engage and retain qualified employees and consultants no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract these employees or consultants when needed the interruption of services of kyle markward would have a material adverse effect on the companys future operations potential profits and development if suitable replacements are not promptly obtained there can be no assurance that such key personnel would accept compensation other than cash for their services in the future in addition the companys success depends in part upon its ability to attract and retain other talented personnel there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain such personnel necessary for the development of the companys business because we have recently commenced business operations we face a high risk of business failure we were formed in november  most of our efforts to date have been related to developing our business plan creating and modifying an allnatural product formula to be used in connection with a homecare microneedle device regimen to remove unwanted tattoos through a diy or doityourself program commencing business activities and the pursuit of the completed offering through august   we have had no operating revenues to speak of and very limited distribution of samples to potential consumers or endusers of our product we face a high risk of business failure because we will be dependent on advertising and marketing firms we will be at a competitive disadvantage to companies having greater resources than us to pay larger fees we will require aggressive efforts in our placement of quality advertisement and marketing on a limited budget that reaches the enduser we do not know when or if we will be able to obtain advertising placement with our projected budget or even if advertising venues will be available for our product the proposed removebyyou system larger companies have typically had the advantage in securing advertisement and marketing placement and venues due to larger budgets and financial resources which we may not be able to compete with there are also no assurances that we will obtain sufficient financing or resources to enter into agreements with advertising or marketing firms we have had no product sales to date and we can give no assurance that there will ever be any sales in the future our product the proposed removebyyou system is still being developed and tested and we have not generated any revenues there is no guarantee that we will ever develop a commercially viable product to become profitable we will have to successfully develop package manufacture market and sell a significant number of removebyyou systems along with its allnatural product formula there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successfully completed that we will be able to manufacture at an acceptable cost and with acceptable quality or that it can be successfully marketed in the future we do not expect to generate revenues until sometime in  there is no guarantee that our product will be accepted by consumers we have not yet commercially released any of our proposed products the removebyyou system and derivations of it thereon the market acceptance of skincare and cosmetic products which we consider the removebyyou system to be varies significantly and cannot be predicted factors that may cause a skincare and cosmetic product to be accepted or rejected by consumers include price quality of ingredients effectiveness packaging availability advertising and numerous other intangible factors consumer demand for our proposed products also may be affected by word of mouth testimonials fads and general consumer trends since we have not consumertest marketed our proposed products we are not certain if any of our products will appeal to our target consumer market while we have tested samples of our allnatural product formula and the use of homecare microneedle devices the targeted consumer market could be quite different from the endusers that have used our allnatural product formula and homecare microneedle regimen to date there can be no assurance that any of our products will gain broad acceptance among consumers unless we can achieve a sufficient following of consumers who may purchase our proposed products we will not operate profitably and may have to cease our operations no assurance can be given that any of our proposed products will achieve sufficient consumer acceptance  fluctuations in our financial results make quarterly comparisons and financial forecasting difficult any revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quartertoquarter because our industry experiences seasonal fluctuations which reflect seasonal trends for health and beauty products we expect that our results will vary significantly in the future because of a number of reasons including · our ability to establish acceptance and usage of our products · our ability to contract with competent manufactures and appropriate wholesalers and retailers · costs related to future growth and capital investment · results of strategic agreements with companies that may supply and produce our products · our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we have not started revenueproducing activities so we have no direct experience with seasonality we understand that other businesses in the skincare industry have experienced seasonal impacts many skin products sell better during the summer months because of the impact on skin from the exposure to sun and others during the winter months because of the dryness associated with winter weather this may affect us with the proposed products which include our removebyyou system which consists of an allnatural product formula and suggested regimen of homecare microneedling techniques because of these fluctuations and uncertainties our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of investors if this happens any trading price of our common stock would almost certainly be materially adversely affected we will be dependent on independent operators and other operators of retail outlets for the sale of our products the success of our planned marketing and distribution program is totally dependent on signing license agreements with owneroperators or distribution agreements with other operators including those who operate tattoo parlors and other tattoo removal service providers we do not know the likelihood of entering into agreements with retailers or the timing that it will take to do so there is also uncertainty about the sales success of retailers if any that do agree to sell our products regulatory and legal uncertainties could harm our business we believe that our business is not subject to material regulation under the laws of the united states or any of the states in which we plan to sell our products laws and regulations often differ materially between states and within individual states such laws and regulations are subject to amendment and reinterpretation by the agencies charged with their enforcement if we become subject to any licensing or regulatory requirements the failure to comply with any such requirements could lead to a revocation suspension or loss of licensing status termination of contracts and legal and administrative enforcement actions we cannot be sure that a review of our current and proposed operations will not result in a determination that could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition moreover regulatory requirements are subject to change from time to time and may in the future become more restrictive thereby making compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise affecting or restricting our ability to conduct our business as now conducted or proposed to be conducted we will be subject to competition from numerous companies including a number of skincare companies that have significantly greater financial and other resources the skincare products business is highly competitive as a component of the tattoo removal business we believe this segment of skincare products is in its early infancy there are an estimated  tattoo parlors operating in the united states tattooing is the sixthfastest growing business in retail according to a prominent dermatology association they estimate that more than  percent of tattoo wearers will eventually seek to have their tattoos removed in some fashion laserassisted tattoo removal has become one of the fastest growth areas of the industry the market for nonlaser methods is growing fast too the skincare business which we believe we generally belong to the company will compete with hundreds of large and small skincare product businesses while some of these businesses are global and varied their products could very well be thought of as direct competition to us providing healing and general skinhealth properties which we believe our unique allnatural product formula provides since most competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do their ability to spend more on advertising and marketing product development and testing and greater flexibility puts us in a significant disadvantage competition in the skincare business is based on product pricing quality innovation perceived value marketing and advertising new product introduction name recognition as well as numerous other factors it is difficult for us to predict how we will be able to effectively compete with competitors in these areas  we will have to rely on third parties to manufacture our products who may not perform to our standards or timeline our business plan assumes that our products will be manufactured by thirdparty businesses on a contract basis no contractual arrangement is currently in place we will seek to enter into these agreements with thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture both ingredients for our allnatural product based formula as well as packaging shipping containers for our doityourself tattoo removal system we will be dependent on timeliness and effectiveness of their efforts failure or lack of reliability in the manufacture of any of the components is likely to result in a loss of business among other risks · our products may fail to provide or achieve the expected results · we may experience limited availability of ingredients used in manufacturing · we may experience poor or inadequate manufacturing quality · our products may have competition from companies attempting to duplicate our formula or diy program utilizing standard homecare microneedle devices and · our customers endusers could experience results which are significantly different than our initial test results there are no assurances that we will obtain sufficient financing or resources to enter into such agreements with manufacturers there are no assurances that homecare microneedle devices manufactured by others will maintain their level of quality and work as directed or that it will be necessary to upgrade to surgicalgrade microneedle devices that required additional scrutiny and are subject to additional regulation and oversight   we have no patent protection and may not be able to protect proprietary rights when needed our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on quality and uniqueness of our diy system and its components we intend to file for trademark protection on our removebyyou system currently we have no trademark protection nor patent protection on any of our proposed products or service offerings proposed formulation of ingredients that we currently use or intend to use in a diy system we intend to protect our rights with respect to our formula and operations through contractual obligations with consultants vendors and others which may be limited while we have no patent protection on our allnatural product based formula or the processes involving the use of homecare microneedle devices with our allnatural product based formula other companies can and will attempt to compete with us by imitating our product offerings we cannot guarantee the adequacy of the protections we intend to take in the future to protect our proprietary rights or that competitors will not independently develop or produce products and product offerings that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours when available for sale we may be subject to product liability claims the development manufacture and sale of skincare products may expose us to the risk of damage from product liability or other consumer claims our proposed diy program along with the proposed use of product tested and industry standard homecare microneedle devices may be subject to limited product testing selfimposed product testing may be done in order to reduce the likelihood of any successful product liability claims against us however no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to product liability claims for the future we intend to obtain and maintain product liability insurance for unknown liabilities when we enter the consumer marketplace assuming that we have sufficient funds available we intend to use third party manufacturers for our products that maintain appropriate levels of liability insurance if we are unable to locate or engage manufacturers for our products that maintain appropriate levels of liability insurance we may be at risk for product liability claims a successful claim in excess of product liability coverage when obtained if any could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for the future there are significant potential conflicts of interest our key personnel are required to commit significant time to our affairs and accordingly these individuals particularly our president may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities in the course of other business activities certain key personnel particularly our president may become aware of business opportu­nities which may be appropriate for presenta­tion to us as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated as such they may have con­flicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented in an effort to resolve such potential conflicts of interest we entered into a written agreement with our president mr markward specifying that any business opportunities that he may become aware of independently or directly through his association with us as opposed to disclosure to his of such business opportunities by management or consultants associated with other entities would be presented by his solely to us  we cannot provide assurances that our efforts to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective because we have nominal assets and no revenue we may be deemed a  shell company by the securities and exchange commission and subject to more stringent reporting requirements the securities and exchange commission sec adopted rule  of the securities act and exchange act rule b which defines a shell company as a registrant that has no or nominal operations and either a no or nominal assets b assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents or c assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets our balance sheet reflects that we have no cash and limited tangible assets and therefore the commission may deem us as a shell company despite the companys belief that we are not by definition a shell company because we have significant operations if we were deemed to be a shell company the rules would prohibit us from using form s to register securities pursuant to employee compensation plans the rules however if we were deemed to be a shell company would not prevent us from registering our securities pursuant to a form s registration statement additionally the rule regarding current reports on form k require a shell company to provide enhanced detailed disclosure upon completion of a transaction that causes it to cease being a shell company if an acquisition is undertaken a shell company must file a current report on form k containing the information required pursuant to regulation sk within four business days following completion of the transaction together with financial information of the acquired entity in order to assist the sec in the identification of shell companies shell companies are required to check a box on form q and form k indicating that they are a shell company to the extent that we are required to comply with additional disclosure because we are deemed a shell company we may be delayed in executing any merger or acquiring assets due to such enhanced disclosure the sec adopted new rule  effective february   which makes the resale of restricted securities by shareholders of a shell company more difficult to accomplish we intend to become subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act that will require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports these additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit following the effective date of our registration statement we were required to file periodic reports with the sec pursuant to the exchange act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder in order to comply with these requirements our independent registered public accounting firm will have to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis moreover our legal counsel will have to review and assist in the preparation of such reports the costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys we currently estimate the annual maintenance and compliance costs of the periodic reporting requirements to be in the range of up to  per annum the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus will have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit we may be exposed to potential risks resulting from any new requirements under section  if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent the occurrence of fraud our business and operating results could be harmed investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and the trading price of our common stock if a market ever develops could drop significantly however for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  or jobs act we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years although we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to such time if we have more than  billion in annual revenue more than  million in market value of our common stock is held by nonaffiliates or we issue more than  billion of nonconvertible debt over a threeyear period our internal controls may become inadequate as we grow which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule af internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that  · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management andor directors of the company and · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements we will rely on the use of outside professionals to assist us in maintaining our internal controls with growth or unmanageable increases in our business plan objectives our internal controls may become inadequate or ineffective which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision with regards to an investment in our common stock in order to mitigate the risks associated with maintaining internal controls if and when the company grows we will engage qualified professionals on an independent contractor basis to assist in reviewing and recording transactions when and if finances permit we will hire an experienced financial professional to oversee our reporting and control functions failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to face regulatory action and also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information either of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition results of operations and future prospects however our auditors will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section  until we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act if we take advantage of the exemptions available to us through the jobs act the costs of being a public company could result in us being unable to continue as a going concern as a public company we will have to comply with numerous financial reporting and legal requirements including those pertaining to audits and internal control the costs of maintaining the public company requirements could be significant and may preclude us from seeking financing or equity investment on acceptable terms we estimate these costs will range up to  per year and may be higher if our business volume and activity ever increases our estimate of costs do not include the necessary compliance documentation and reporting requirements for section  as we will not be subject to the full reporting requirements of section  until we exceed  million in market capitalization if we decide to optout of the emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act to take advantage of the exemptions available to us through the jobs act or we have been public for more than five years if our revenues are insufficient or nonexistent andor we cannot satisfy many of these costs through the issuance of our shares we may be unable to satisfy these costs in the normal course of business which would result in our being unable to continue as a going concern having only one director limits our ability to establish effective independent corporate governance procedures and increases the control of our president we have only one director who also serves as the companys chief executive officer and president accordingly we cannot establish board committees comprised of independent members to oversee functions like compensation or audit issues in addition a vote of the board members is decided in favor of our chairman which gives him significant control over all corporate issues until we have a larger board of directors that would include some independent members if ever there will be limited oversight of our presidents decisions and activities and little ability for minority shareholders to challenge or reverse those activities and decisions even if they are not in the best interests of minority shareholders  risks related to our common stock we are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain whether the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile in addition section  of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies however we are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period and as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for nonemerging growth companies section  of the jobs act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable the company sold its shares without an underwriter the common shares offered were done on a direct primary basis no brokerdealer was retained as an underwriter and no brokerdealer was under any obligation to purchase any common shares there were no firm commitments to purchase any of the shares in the completed offering the sale of a small number of shares increases the likelihood of no market ever developing only a few persons purchased shares in our offering  investors may lose their entire investment without us being even able to develop a market for our shares since there was a limited number of shares sold and investors  in our offering we may lost likely will be unable to create a public market of any kind for our shares without a public market for our shares the limited number of shares that we may be able to sell will be highly illiquid or unable to be sold to any other potential investors in such an event it is highly likely that the entire investment by an investor in our common stock would be lost the offering price of our common stock was determined arbitrarily the price of our common stock in the completed offering was not been determined by any independent financial evaluation market mechanism or by our auditors and is therefore to a large extent arbitrary our audit firm has not reviewed managements valuation and therefore expresses no opinion as to the fairness of the completed offering price as determined by management as a result the price of the common stock may not reflect the value perceived by the market there can be no assurance that the shares offered are worth the price for which the investors paid therefore lose a portion or all of their investment shareholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through issuance of additional shares of our common stock we have no committed source of financing wherever possible our board of directors will attempt to use noncash consideration to satisfy obligations in many instances we believe that the noncash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock our board of directors has authority without action or vote of the shareholders to issue all or part of the authorized  shares but unissued  shares in addition if a trading market develops for our common stock we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock possibly at a discount to market these actions will certainly result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders further dilute common stock book value and that this dilution may be material  our completed offering proceeds were slightly more than its costs the company received little economic benefit from the offering beyond our offering we may not be able to raise sufficient financing or resources to develop manufacture and market our products the proceeds of the offering  was greater than costs incurred to complete the offering  approximately  of the proceeds was used as payment for costs directly associated with the offering approximately  or  was available for operational costs such as inventory or other productiondevelopment costs we will require additional financial resources or delay payment of certain costs which may inhibit or delay growth we therefore received little financial benefit from the offering the interests of shareholders may be hurt because we can issue shares of our common stock to individuals or entities that support existing management with such issuances serving to enhance existing managements ability to maintain control of our company our board of directors has authority without action or vote of the shareholders to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued common shares such issuances may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management and the interests of existing management which may not be the same as the interests of other shareholders our ability to issue shares without shareholder approval serves to enhance existing managements ability to maintain control of our company our articles of incorporation provide for indemnification of officers and directors at our expense and limit their liability that may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our shareholders because corporate resources may be expended for the benefit of officers andor directors our articles of incorporation at article xi provide for indemnification as follows no director or officer of the corporation shall be personally liable to the corporation or any of its stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer provided however that the foregoing provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer i for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct fraud or knowing violation of law or ii the payment of dividends in violation of section  of the nevada revised statutes any repeal or modification of an article by the stockholders of the corporation shall be prospective only and shall not adversely affect any limitation of the personal liability of a director or officer of the corporation for acts or omissions prior to such repeal or modification we have been advised that in the opinion of the sec indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws is against public policy as expressed in the securities act of  and is therefore unenforceable in the event that a claim for indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action suit or proceeding is asserted by a director officer or controlling person in connection with our activities we will unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the securities act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue the legal process relating to this matter if it were to occur is likely to be very costly and may result in us receiving negative publicity either of which factors is likely to materially reduce the market and price for our shares if such a market ever develops currently there is no established public market for our securities and there can be no assurances that any established public market will ever develop or that our common stock will be quoted for trading and even if quoted it is likely to be subject to significant price fluctuations prior to the date of this report there has not been any established trading market for our common stock and there is currently no established public market whatsoever for our securities a market maker has filed an application with finra on our behalf so as to be able to quote the shares of our common stock on the otcbb while the market makers application has been accepted by finra there can be no assurance as to whether i any market for our shares will develop ii the prices at which our common stock will trade or iii the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active liquid trading market active trading markets generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders for investors  while we are able to have our shares quoted on the otcbb and the otcqb the share price quotation service owned by otc markets inc the former pink sheets we recently through a brokerdealer and its clearing firm were approved with the depository trust company dtc to permit our shares to trade electronically it is commonly believed if an issuer is not dtceligible then its shares cannot be electronically transferred between brokerage accounts which based on the realities of the marketplace as it exists today especially the otcbb and the otcqb means that shares of a company will not be traded technically the shares can be traded manually between accounts but this takes days and is not a realistic option for companies relying on broker dealers for stock transactions  like all companies on the otcbb and the otcqb while we have dtceligibility this is not a requirement panacea in order to trade on the otcbb or the otcqb we firmly believe that it is a necessity to process trades on the otcbb and the otcqb if we are going to trade with any volume in addition to the foregoing our common stock is unlikely to be followed by market analysts and there may be few institutions acting as market makers for our common stock either of these factors could adversely affect the liquidity and trading price of our common stock until our common stock is fully distributed and an orderly market develops in our common stock if ever the price at which it trades is likely to fluctuate significantly prices for our common stock will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors including the depth and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock developments affecting our business including the impact of the factors referred to elsewhere in these risk factors investor perception of the companys common stock and operations as well as general economic and market conditions no assurances can be given that an orderly or liquid market will ever develop because of the anticipated low price of the securities many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in these securities purchasers of our securities should be aware that any market that develops in our stock will be subject to the penny stock restrictions any market that develops in shares of our common stock will be subject to the penny stock regulations and restrictions pertaining to low priced stocks that will create a lack of liquidity and make trading difficult or impossible the trading of our securities if any will be in the overthecounter market which is commonly referred to as the otcbb or the otcqb as maintained by finra and otc market groups respectively as a result an investor may find it difficult to dispose of or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of our securities rule a of the exchange act establishes the definition of a penny stock for purposes relevant to us as any equity security that has a minimum bid price of less than  per share or with an exercise price of less than  per share subject to a limited number of exceptions which are not available to us it is likely that our shares will be considered to be penny stocks for the immediately foreseeable future this classification severely and adversely affects any market liquidity for our common stock for any transaction involving a penny stock unless exempt the penny stock rules require that a broker or dealer approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased in order to approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks the broker or dealer must also deliver prior to any transaction in a penny stock a disclosure schedule prepared by the sec relating to the penny stock market which in highlight form sets forth · the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination and · that the broker or dealer received a signed written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stock in both public offerings and in secondary trading and the commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered representative current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions additionally monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks  because of these regulations brokerdealers may not wish to engage in the abovereferenced necessary paperwork and disclosures andor may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other holders to sell their shares in any secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market these additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities if and when our securities become publicly traded in addition the liquidity for our securities may decrease with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future and our shareholders will in all likelihood find it difficult to sell their securities the market for penny stocks has experienced numerous frauds and abuses that could adversely impact investors in our stock company management believes that the market for penny stocks has suffered from patterns of fraud and abuse such patterns include · control of the market for the security by one or a few brokerdealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer · manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases · boiler room practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by sales persons · excessive and undisclosed bidask differentials and markups by selling brokerdealers and · wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and brokerdealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses any trading market that may develop may be restricted by virtue of state securities blue sky laws that prohibit trading absent compliance with individual state laws these restrictions may make it difficult or impossible to sell shares in those states there is currently no established public market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that any established public market will develop in the foreseeable future transfer of our common stock may also be restricted under the securities or securities regulations laws promulgated by various states and foreign jurisdictions commonly referred to as blue sky laws absent compliance with such individual state laws our common stock may not be traded in such jurisdictions because the securities registered hereunder have not been registered for resale under the blue sky laws of any state the holders of such shares and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant state blue sky law restrictions upon the ability of investors to sell the securities and of purchasers to purchase the securities these restrictions prohibit the secondary trading of our common stock we currently do not intend to and may not be able to qualify securities for resale in at least  states which do not offer manual exemptions or may offer manual exemptions but may not offer one to us if we are considered to be a shell company at the time of application and require shares to be qualified before they can be resold by our shareholders accordingly investors should consider the secondary market for our securities to be a limited one our board of directors consisting of one person has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common stockholders and with the ability to affect adversely stockholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us our articles of incorporation allow us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval including large blocks of preferred stock as a result our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares together with a premium prior to the redemption of our common stock the ability of our president to control our business may limit or eliminate minority shareholders ability to influence corporate affairs our president beneficially owns an aggregate of  of our outstanding common stock because of his stock ownership our president continues to be in a position to continue to elect our board of directors decide all matters requiring stockholder approval and determine our policies the interests of our president may differ from the interests of other shareholders with respect to the issuance of shares business transactions with or sales to other companies selection of officers and directors and other business decisions minority shareholders would have no way of overriding decisions made by our president this level of control may also have an adverse impact on the market value of our shares because our president may institute or undertake transactions policies or programs that may result in losses may not take any steps to increase our visibility in the financial community andor may sell sufficient numbers of shares to significantly decrease our price per share  all of our presently issued and outstanding common shares are restricted under rule  of the securities act as amended when the restriction on any or all of these shares is lifted and the shares are sold in the open market the price of our common stock could be adversely affected a significant portion of our presently outstanding shares of common stock  shares are restricted securities as defined under rule  promulgated under the securities act and may only be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration if available rule  provides in essence that a person who is not an affiliate and has held restricted securities for a prescribed period of at least six  months if purchased from a reporting issuer or twelve  months as is the case herein if purchased from a nonreporting company may under certain conditions sell all or any of his shares without volume limitation in brokerage transactions affiliates however may not sell shares in excess of  of the companys outstanding common stock each three months as a result of revisions to rule  which became effective february   there is no limit on the amount of restricted securities that may be sold by a nonaffiliate ie a stockholder who has not been an officer director or control person for at least  consecutive days after the restricted securities have been held by the owner for the prescribed period of time a sale under amended rule  or under any other exemption from the act if available or pursuant to registration of shares of common stock of present stockholders may have a depressive effect upon the price of the common stock in any market that may develop of the  shares of common stock issued and outstanding  are owned by our president which consists of  shares issued for organizational expenses and  shares issued for intangible assets and may be sold commencing one year from our registration statements effectiveness we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future the future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings capital requirements financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock return on your investment if any will depend solely on an increase if any in the market value of our common stock because we are not subject to compliance with rules requiring the adoption of certain corporate governance measures our stockholders have limited protection against interested director transactions conflicts of interest and similar matters sarbanesoxley act of  as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the sec the new york and american stock exchanges and the nasdaq stock market as a result of sarbanesoxley require the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance these measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities that are listed on those exchanges or the nasdaq stock market because we are not presently required to comply with many of the corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with such compliance any sooner than legally required we have not yet adopted these measures because none of our directors currently one person are independent directors we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees as a result these directors have the ability among other things to determine their own level of compensation until we comply with such corporate governance measures regardless of whether such compliance is required the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions conflicts of interest if any and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations we intend to comply with all corporate governance measures relating to director independence as and when required however we may find it very difficult or be unable to attract and retain qualified officers directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective management as a result of sarbanesoxley act of  the enactment of the sarbanesoxley act of  has resulted in a series of rules and regulations by the sec that increase responsibilities and liabilities of directors and executive officers the perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may make it more costly or deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles some of these corporate governance measures have been metered by the jobs act of   you may have limited access to information regarding our business because our obligations to file periodic reports with the sec could be automatically suspended under certain circumstances as of the effective date may   of our registration statement we became subject to certain informational requirements of the exchange act as amended and are required to file periodic reports ie annual quarterly and material events with the sec which are immediately available to the public for inspection and copying except during the year that our registration statement becomes effective these reporting obligations may in our sole discretion be automatically suspended under section d of the exchange act if we have less than  shareholders and do not file a registration statement on form a of which we have no current plans to file if this occurs after the year in which our registration statement becomes effective we will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with the sec and your access to our business information would then be even more restricted after our effectiveness we are required to deliver periodic reports to security holders however we are not be required to furnish proxy statements to security holders and our directors officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the sec pursuant to section  of the exchange act previously a company with more than  shareholders of record and  million in assets had to register under the exchange act however the jobs act raises the minimum shareholder threshold from  to either  persons or  persons who are not accredited investors or  persons in the case of banks and bank holding companies the jobs act excludes securities received by employees pursuant to employee stock incentive plans for purposes of calculating the shareholder threshold this means that access to information regarding our business and operations will be limited if we were designated a shell your ability to resell your shares would be limited all of the presently outstanding shares of our common stock are restricted securities as defined under amended rule  promulgated under the securities act and may only be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration if available the sec adopted final rules amending rule  which became effective february   pursuant to amended rule  one year must elapse from the time a shell company as defined under rule  of the securities act and rule b of the exchange act ceases to be a shell company additionally the registrant must file a current report on form k addressing item  with such information and disclosure as required in a form  filing with the sec before a restricted securities shareholder can resell their holdings in reliance on amended rule  the form  information or disclosure is equivalent to such information and disclosure that an issuer would be required to file if it were registering a class of securities on form  under the exchange act under amended rule  restricted or unrestricted securities initially issued by a reporting or nonreporting shell company or a company that was at any time previously a shell company can only be resold in reliance on amended rule  if the following conditions are met    the issuer of the

expanding at an average annual rate of more than  to  million in annual revenues in  increased social acceptability of and interest in tattoos has driven the demand which ultimately increased the pool of potential customers ie tattoo removal consumers who may regret their initial decision and want their tattoos removed further pushing growth has been the post recession says industry analyst justin molavi with “heightened unemployment increasing demand from job seekers who wanted to cover up tattoos to improve their job prospects” at the same time the recession caused disposable income to decline which mitigated overall growth because it limited consumers ability to pay for their tattoo removal innovation has been a key focus in the tattoo removal business with increasing use of qswitching laser technology to remove tattoos which allows less patient evasiveness and scarring according to molavi “this move has not only resulted in higher demand for tattoo removal since consumers generally prefer this method but also supported demand for tattoos because people now see how relatively easy it is to remove them with this method in comparison to other methods used by the industry” industry players purchased this technology at accelerating rates to meet demand from customers who demanded tattoo removal management believes that the industry will continue to grow over the next five years albeit at a slower rate although demand will still be high given the ease of removal with laser assisted technology the boost in demand that resulted from high unemployment will fade as the united states economy gains steam and unemployment declines the absence of the high growth experienced during the recent past will result in fewer new entrants although existing companies such as medermis laser clinic laseraway and the dr tattoff franchise business only comprise a small share of the tattoo removal business revenue they continue to increase market share through geographical expansion it is believed that most ‘tattoo removal’ business will come from the southeastern western and midatlantic regions of the united states due to their higher population densities and the presence of major metropolitan areas while we are not a laser assisted technology tattoo removal business we consider them our direct competitors along with the large skincare manufacturers due to our all natural ingredient product formula we will compete using contacts to develop opportunities to meet prospective distributors that we will partner with as quickly as our limited resources will permit these opportunities will come from contacts and referrals that we make through our independent consultants and our president the ability to take advantage of these opportunities will depend upon our ability to secure sufficient funding for our product development and manufacturing and marketing and advertising professionals however we cannot predict the likelihood or timing for our success no assurances can be given that our competitive strategy will have any success company description removebyyou inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on november   at which time it acquired a unique allnatural product formula to be used with a regimen of homecare microneedle devices to remove unwanted tattoos through a diy or doityourself program created by its founder mr kyle markward  rby is in the business of developing packaging preparing to eventually market and sell an allnatural product formula to be used with a regimen of homecare microneedle devices to remove unwanted tattoos through a diy program specifically rby developed what it calls its ‘removebyyou’ system a unique allnatural cosmeceutical product formula that is the main component of the system rby owns certain property it believes to be intellectual in nature  suggested use or procedures employing homecare microneedle devices with an allnatural product formula assisting the body with its own healing process in removing unwanted tattoos the “removebyyou” system we believe works in a symbiotic manner with the body’s natural healing process and the removal of foreign materials through the lymphatic system symbiosis is commonly referred to as a close and often longterm interaction between two or more different biological organisms in  albert bernhard frank used the word symbiosis to describe the mutualistic relationship in lichens in  the german mycologist heinrich anton de bary defined it as the living together of unlike organisms symbiotic relationships include those associations in which one organism lives on another ectosymbiosis such as mistletoe or where one partner lives inside the other endosymbiosis such as lactobacilli and other bacteria in humans or symbiodinium in coral symbiosis may be classified by physical attachment of organisms symbiosis in which organisms have bodily union called conjunctive symbiosis and symbiosis in which they are not in union called disjunctive symbiosis the skin serves as the human bodys most important epithelial interface as the bodys largest organ the skin serves not only as physical protection of the bloodstream but assists with thermoregulation and osmoregulation of the human body we believe that through the use of our “removeby you” system which consists of our unique allnatural product formula and the suggested use of homecare microneedle devices in varying patterns perform commensality or as a symbiotic function with its host the skin in stimulating the healing process ink removal and its desired results tattoo removal the company does not own patents or rights to intellectual property that would be protected under patent andor trademark protection afforded in the united states the company formulates and tests its product and service offering through the skills of mr markward and through the engagement of discussion with potential suppliers vendors andor skincare product distributors who may help sell our diy program into the marketplace to date no saleable product or revenues have been generated from these development efforts professional skin needling is considered a safe skin treatment when performed by a medical aesthetician nurse or physician homecare microneedling devices are designed specifically for inhome use they are largely unregulated due to the size of the needles and design our system suggests the use of only homecare microneedling devices specially designed homecare models with short fine needles of approximately mm depth may be used two to three times per week to reduce pore size oil production fine lines and enhance delivery and effectiveness of topical agents such as our unique allnatural product formula to promote tattoo removal the quality of needles is of the utmost importance as many products sold on the internet are made with poorquality needles to date we use the derma roller™ brand in our testing we do not however advocate one brand over another microneedling at home can be done three times per week combined with our allnatural product formula on the tattooed area as well nontattooed areas the first microneedle device was invented in germany by an entrepreneur as a drumshaped handroller a handheld device that uses two hundred fine needles to create micro channels in the skin offering a range of five needle sizes from  mm to  mm we found that when a handheld homecare microneedle device is used with a topical serum particularly our allnatural product formula the skin’s absorption of the serum is enhanced the repair process we believe begins almost immediately approximately one to two hours after application microchannels created by the homecare microneedles fully close or shrink considerably in size through the skin’s own natural healing process allowing the user’s normal routine to resume with use of an all natural product formula contained in our ‘removebyyou’ system along with proper use of homecare microneedles the user’s macrophage skin cell are activated through treatment and gradually start to fade tattoo granules of color or pigment naturally along with breaking down tiny ink particles the user’s macrophage skin cells begin to remove foreign objects naturally and with the assistance and application of our allnatural product formula the user’s skin begins to heal naturally unwanted tattoos we believe begin to fade over a series of treatments carried away by the bodys natural lymphatic system our initial observations are based on ten users who desired to have their unwanted tattoos removed without the use of laser or caustic chemicals initial product development which consisted of our unique formula the use of standard homecare microneedle devices began early in  in connection with professional guidance of two skincare consultants we developed a regimen of specific procedures using homecare microneedle devices preprocedure preparation of the tattooed skin area as well as postpreparation or recovery period maintenance to optimize results most of our product testing resulted from users located in fairfield county connecticut and the new york city region users over time began to see positive effects on unwanted tattooed areas with no discernible scarring or further damage to their skin we cannot guarantee that our diy program once fully developed will produce these qualities or generate such results on a widespread basis or otherwise we believe that our ‘removebyyou’ system utilizes a unique topical serum blend of essential oils botanicals and other natural ingredients that provides nourishment to the skin as well as assisting the body in ridding itself of unwanted ink as mentioned above through trial and error we developed a system using an unscientific methodology of microneedle techniques in association with a unique formula to be used on the skin during and after the techniques to aid in proper lymphatic removal this system we believe penetrates the skin delivering essential nutrients to below the surface layer of skin assisting the body in its natural process of collagen generation along with the body’s natural lymphatic system removal of ‘unwanted’ foreign bodies for our user’s commonly known as microphage or tattoo ink particles as mentioned above purely anecdotal stories obtained from our trial and error user efforts describe a decrease in tattoo appearance after regular use of our ‘system’ we believe that a user may achieve an appearance of natural unblemished skin or lessened tattoo presence through our ‘system’ and its unique formula our executive offices are located at  walnut hill road bethel connecticut  and our telephone number is   full description the ipo profiles may contain historical
