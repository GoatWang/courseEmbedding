home  patara pharma improving the lives of patients diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis patara pharma is a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to significantly improving the lives of patients suffering from pulmonary fibrosis based on promising phase a results we are currently preparing to initiate a robust phase b clinical trial of our lead candidate pa for the treatment of chronic cough in patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis an orphan disease with no curative therapy beyond treating chronic cough an often debilitating symptom for many pulmonary fibrosis patients we are also evaluating the potential of pa to slow progression of the underlying disease read about our phase a results » disease pulmonary fibrosis is a family of lung diseases characterized by scarring and thickening of lung tissue leading to an irreversible loss of lung function and reduced life expectancy idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf is the most common interstitial lung disease and is characterized as “idiopathic” because the cause of the disease is unknown ipf is a serious and progressive lung disease with a median life expectancy of about  years no known cure and limited treatment options approximately  adults in the united states and as many as  million adults worldwide are believed to have ipf most patients diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis suffer from a dry nonproductive cough that interrupts their daily living and significantly contributes to poor quality of life chronic coughing lasting more than  weeks can have a debilitating physical and psychosocial burden exacerbate concomitant respiratory disease cause loss of sleep and reduce social mobility cough is an independent predictor of disease progression in ipf and therefore cough may contribute to the progression of the underlying disease we believe pa is the first and only drug that has been demonstrated to be potentially safe and effective for treating chronic cough in patients with ipf patara is now preparing to initiate a phase b clinical trial in these patients to identify the optimal dose for further evaluation in a phase  program additionally the active ingredient in pa has been demonstrated to have potent antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effects in multiple animal models of fibrotic disease including models of pulmonary fibrosis we plan to further evaluate the potential for pa to significantly slow progression of ipf potentially leading to initiation of phase  clinical trials in the near future while there are two approved therapies for treating ipf these are not projected to be utilized by more than  of ipf patients so there is still a very significant need for new ipf therapies that can provide further treatment benefit and improve quality of life approximately  of ipf patients suffer from chronic cough about half are considered “refractory” because they do not respond to currently available medicines these patients cough up to  times per hour which can lead to laryngeal trauma chest pain headache incontinence vomiting anxiety depression and other morbidities chronic cough is one of the most significant contributors to poor quality of life in ipf and may also be an independent predictor of disease progression   the us fda recently convened a public meeting where patients with ipf described the burden of chronic cough  the voice of the patient us fda public meeting report march  one caregiver shared that his wife would “just be soaking wet from sweat” after a coughing fitmy cough comes with exertion… walking up a flight of stairs … putting your clothes on bending over and tying your shoes fixing something in the kitchen moving aroundmy cough was really so deep that it felt like i broke my ribs and my ribs became so cramped that i couldnt even twist my bodyon my worst days coughing will wipe you out for an entire day … physically youre exhausted product patara’s lead drug candidate pa is an inhaled therapeutic delivered directly to the lungs via a proprietary aerosol device the pari eflow® we believe delivery of pa directly to the lungs of pulmonary fibrosis patients is the most effective way to treat chronic cough and the underlying disease pa works by inhibiting inflammatory mediators that contribute to cough and potentially slowing the progression of fibrosis the pari eflow is a portable handheld device that produces a soft mist which patients can conveniently inhale this delivery system achieves high lung deposition and distribution of pa thus offering the potential to optimally reduce chronic coughing and the debilitating morbidities associated with it in clinical trials conducted in patients diagnosed with ipf pa has achieved a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in cough frequency which was supported by positive trends in cough severity and quality of life as assessed by patients in the study importantly paeflow has been welltolerated thus far with no significant

reduction in daytime cough frequency versus placebo on day  compared to baseline this reduction in cough frequency was supported by positive trends in coughspecific quality of life and cough severity as assessed by patients in the study importantly the therapy was well tolerated with no significant treatmentrelated adverse events “chronic cough is a debilitating symptom for many ipf patients that

by the significant improvement in chronic cough we observed among patients in our positive phase  trial and we plan to move forward in early  with a robust phase b study to identify the optimal dose” study design and results patara conducted the randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled twoperiod crossover study at multiple centers in the united kingdom and the netherlands evaluating  adult ipf patients with refractory chronic cough patients with a daytime cough severity score of moderatesevere and an average daytime cough count of at least  coughs per hour using an objective cough monitor

obtained at baseline and day  using the leicester cough monitor as well as subjective patient reported assessments of cough severity coughspecific quality of life and diseasespecific quality of life

this reduction in cough frequency was supported by meaningful trends in all of the patientreported subjective assessments coughspecific quality of life cough severity and the chest symptom domain of disease‑specific quality of life favoring treatment with pa suggesting a positive relationship between objective cough count and subjective outcome measures improvements in all patient reported outcome scores were more significant for those patients on pa who achieved  percent reduction in average hour cough count than for the total number of ipf patients on pa demonstrating a strong correlation between the magnitude reduction in cough experienced by ipf patients and improvements in their quality of life and cough severity scores overall treatment with pa administered for  days was safe and well tolerated in the patients who participated in this study there were no serious adverse events the incidence of treatmentemergent adverse events was comparable between the two

condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry for more information download the phrma

progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news mustknow facts about drug costs did you know due to negotiation and competition medicine costs are growing at the
