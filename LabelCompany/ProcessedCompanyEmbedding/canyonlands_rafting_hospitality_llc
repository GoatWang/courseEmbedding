days ago new this was an impromptu stay and they sorted out a wonderfully accessible room with a roll in shower and lots of space you do need to mention if you need some kind of access as a lot of the rooms are up  down  or  steps so it helps them to allocate a decent room for you if they know steps are problematic the welcome at reception was just lovely and with free cookies and ice water  lemon

excellent location” reviewed  days ago new this was one of the best hotels we stayed in during our two week roadtrip in nevada arizona and utah the room was really good with two queen size beads and one sofa bed we were four persons and had plenty of room we really appreciated the bendable lights two by each bed making it possible for us to read in bedthe hotel is convinently situated close to plenty of restaurants and close to the arches making it possible to get there early in the morningthe breakfast was good and most importantly for us it included fresh fruit and yoghurt the hotel has a lovely pool to use after hiking and although small it was never crowdedthe only setback was that we had our room close to where the breakfast was and the elevator whenever people were talking outside the room it was like they were in our room the people in the room next to us were having very loud fights and we could hear them yelling and speaking loudly room tip not close to the elevator lots of people walking by see more room tips green features excellent information at the breakfast buffet about the use of disposable plates etc stayed july  traveled with family rooms cleanliness service

hotel reviews  helpful votes “shocking its a best western but with luxury” reviewed  days ago new i tend to stay in nice boutique hotels but was booked at this best western as part of a package deal with a sheri griffith rafting trip which was awesome the hotel is located in a great part of town convenient to shopping and the best restaurants the staff were friendly and professional making my checkin and checkout smooth and quick the best part of this hotel has to be the rooms they are huge clean and updated i never would have expected such a great room from best western while the staff are friendly their restaurant recommendations appeared to be based on contacts versus actual quality look at trip advisor or other sources to find some great places to eat also the breakfast was pretty low quality and just didnt match the rest of the quality of the rooms so maybe look at a local café for breakfast if you want something nicer but overall this hotel was a pleasant surprise and easy to recommend to others if im ever in moab again i would hesitate to stay here again stayed june  traveled solo sleep quality rooms service helpful thank newyorkerla report ask newyorkerla about

similarly priced hotels in other areas and different chains we were highly disappointed in the quality of his hotel for the price we paid lots of small inconveniences and missed opportunities in
