studies george mason university first job as a sales clerk for the limited it was a big exciting thing to work there and spend your paycheck on the clothes family husband marc and two kids katie  and danny  in great falls business strategy how’s business i almost feel bad saying it but we had our best year last year despite the economic downturn our income went up drastically we maintained our quality — having good loans we never were out there trying to do risky loans that paid off for us guiding principles being fair you don’t prefer one kid over the other you don’t prefer one employee over the other have you ever read “the one minute manager” i live by it oneminute compliment oneminute reprimand oneminute planning i’m a big planner if i don’t have a plan i feel lost what do you always ask during interviews i like to know what makes them tick because if they’re happy i’m happy how do you avoid the next recession make sure that you always look at the ups and downs of an interest rate risk at all times even when times are good because you don’t know when things will change on the troubled asset relief program we currently have tarp tarp was a great program the treasury came up with it was a cheap capital source to be able to grow we’re definitely one of the first banks to apply for this small business loan fund and we’ll be paying tarp off with that judgment calls your worst days dealing with personnel issues trying to make everybody happy your best days i have people i meet with — i talk about their business or brainstorm about what they should do financially and how they should structure deals it’s fun craziest career decision starting a bank that’s a scary proposition we had gotten our preapprovals the preaudit it was the night before we were going to open the doors — april   — gosh i don’t think i could sleep i remember looking at my husband and saying ‘oh my gosh what if the customers don’t come’ that was a real fear on being dc’s guinea pig we loved it we loved charting new grounds all the new commissioners were great but they were shortlived so you couldn’t really develop a relationship but as far as starting from scratch it was exciting true confessions what do most not know about bankers it’s not bankers’ hours i live the bank on being a woman in a man’s world i don’t feel like i’m treated differently or if they do they don’t tell me to my face your own craziest financial move i can’t tell you that my husband will read it guilty pleasure impulse shopping favorite book other than business reading my pleasure reading is john grisham favorite movie i’m a movie person that’s what my husband and i do on date night go to the movies i like action movies and romantic comedies and i loved all the john grisham movies favorite place outside of the office palm beach fla we bought a house there because we went there too many times what do most people not know about you i don’t cook it’s not one of my talents bizspace

to save money on your monthly bills is to replace the windows in your home compared to other expensive and timeconsuming home improvements window replacement is an upgrade that can help retain the heat in your home and greatly minimize your heating bill if you live in an older residence you might have singlepane windows that do not have todays innovative technology that keeps the cold out and the warmth inside in the summer months modern windows perform the opposite function some even have special protection against ultraviolet rays deflecting the sun on the hottest summer days double the pane equals financial gain the first consideration in upgrading your windows is single or doublepane although singlepane windows are less expensive double pane windows offer added protection from the heat and cold and they also protect your home from dust debris and pests you might think that youre saving money by purchasing cheap windows but if you spend a little more youll see an instant return on your investment when you open your next power bill highquality modern double pane windows should adhere to industry standards set by the national fenestration rating council if your windows have an nfrc label you can be sure they are highquality windows that can last for generations windows with multiple panes can be filled with gases like krypton and argon which helps reduce heat loss and increases rvalues or resistance to heat loss the higher the rvalue the better your new windows can protect against heat loss another factor to consider is the windows uvalue or its resistance to heat transfer when researching window options both rvalue and uvalue information should be available for the entire window some manufacturers only offer this information for the middle of the window there are many styles of modern windows to choose from but not every option may fit your budget some options companies offer dont necessarily make a difference in savings for instance window companies might try to talk you into double pane windows with more than one inch between the windows while this space between the windows creates better insulation more than an inch does not make for more energy
