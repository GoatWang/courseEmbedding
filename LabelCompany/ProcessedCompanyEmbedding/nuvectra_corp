situations eventdrivensummarynuvectra has gone nowhere post spinoffthe company is at its initial stage of trying to build out its sales infrastructureinvestors should wait a few more quarter to have a better understanding of revenue growth and cash burnnuvectra nasdaq nvtr has gone nowhere since it was spunoff from its parent company integer holdings corp nyse itgr formerly known as greatbatch in fact its down around  from the initial first trading day there was a major sell off right after the first days of trading probably due to institutional investors having to sell since the company is considered a microcap trading at  million it has rallied since than but there is still some interesting quantitative metrics that make it look attractive overview nuvectra basically has one products on the market the product is called algovita it treats chronic pain through neurostimulation technology the technology is used in the spinal cord sacral nerve and the deep brain stimulation markets the market as a whole for neurostimulation technology is estimated to be  billion here is what management has to say about their competitive advantages for their product from form  differentiated neurostimulation technology platform broad range of algovita capabilities algovitas robust design helps minimize therapy failures and enables greater control and precision in providing therapy algovitas upgradeable technology enables next generation offerings this is an interesting investment opportunity the company is in the initial setup phase of ramping up sales and marketing so basically an investor is getting in on the ground floor of a medical device company with this though comes risk but with some protection management is hoping to focus on strategic markets here in the us for scs treatments and develop a network of distributors and independent sales agents for sales internationally valuation and financial metrics market capitalization   million market price per share    shares outstanding   source sec filing the company trades slightly above ncav and below book value also the majority of the current assets is cash at  million which is greater than the current value of the company revenue for the last quarter came in at  million which is a  increase from prior year this past year services revenue has started to show up for the first  month services revenue was  million as more devices are sold this should correlate to increased services revenue there is a long ways to go though for the company to be profitable the first  months the company lost  million and will continue to add up losses until they finish ramping up sales to meet their breakeven point this could take a while they should have  active sales territories and  by the end of this quarter currently the product margins are  and service margins are  these should expand as economies of scale kicks in piper jaffray has a  price target which is right around book value and  above todays price i think the company is fairly valued currently even with it selling close to ncav this is an early stage medical device company that trades in a volatile market the ramp up of sales seems to be slow with algovita which is their main product to protect downside risk investors should wait to atleast purchase shares at or below ncav the company is well capitalized and the balance sheet looks strong this is offset though by the earnings losses the company will have to manage while building out its sales infrastructure and continues to do research and development its on track to produce operating cash flow losses of  million for  theres plenty of cash on the balance sheet to counteract this for the next few years and for management to have ample time to see if they can create a viable company if they cant downside risk is the operating business is worth nothing and shareholders are left with just technology patents and ppe worth around  million this isnt a risk im will to take currently investors need to see more clarity in the coming quarterly reports on how the sales growth is materializing management compensation the company has tried to incentivize its directors and top executives through ownership of stock to directly align them with shareholders scott dree is the ceo of the company with years of experience in the neurostimulation market his base salary will be around  but after the spinoff he received a one time  equity position in the company those shares are currently worth  million but has the potential to be worth significantly more the cfo walter berger received a similar incentive but only received a  equity position takeaway investors need to see a few more quarters to understand the revenue growth and net income losses going forward the cash burn could be extreme if management cant slow down the earnings losses which will just eat away at ncav and book value revenue growth will be the factor in valuing the company going forward this company has the feel to me that it would be a good strategic purchase to competitors especially once it gains product traction in these strategic markets it wants to focus on the best way to judge this is through product and service revenue growth by waiting a few more quarters this will allow us to see a clearer picture in how physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers are responding to the product this is a unique opportunity but right now i cant tell if the odds are in nuvectra shareholders favor and i like to invest when i know they are to read more research on stock spinoffs
