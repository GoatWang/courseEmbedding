from good hands to boxing glovesedit this is the title of a book written by david berardinelli jd michael freeman phd dc mph and aaron deshaw dc jd with a foreword by eugene r anderson the book relates profitboosting strategies that consulting firm mckinsey  company presented to allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim mckinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for fortune  companies including controversial clients such as enron to maximize profits mckinsey’s recommendation to allstate according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves  the book was reviewed by business week magazine according to that article allstate responded to berardinellis allegations by claiming that berardinellis allegations were unfounded and unproven rather than trying to cheat customers the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying exaggerated and fraudulent claims and that its processes are absolutely sound    to investigate evaluate and promptly resolve each claim fairly based on the merits court decisions on the issues debated by berardinelli and allstate have gone both ways according to the business week article as of  courts and regulators in a

accidents on the other hand the article also states that although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in badfaith cases against allstate the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on ccpr last december a montana state court noted that while ccpr practices may be illegal if misapplied in a particular case they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose

lower rates with the state and give customers  days’ notice from good hands to boxing glovesedit this is the title of a book written by david berardinelli jd michael freeman phd dc mph and aaron deshaw dc jd with a foreword by eugene r anderson the book relates profitboosting strategies that consulting firm mckinsey  company presented to allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim mckinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for fortune  companies including controversial clients such as enron to maximize profits mckinsey’s recommendation to allstate according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves  the book was reviewed by business week magazine according to that article allstate responded to berardinellis allegations by claiming that berardinellis allegations were unfounded and unproven rather than trying to cheat customers the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying exaggerated and fraudulent claims and that its processes are absolutely sound    to investigate evaluate and promptly resolve each claim fairly based on the merits court decisions on the issues debated by berardinelli and allstate have gone both ways according to the business week article as of  courts and regulators in a number of states including new york pennsylvania and washington have forced allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial do i need an attorney form to people involved in accidents on the other hand the article also states that although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in badfaith cases against allstate the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on ccpr last december a montana state court noted that while ccpr practices may be illegal if misapplied in a particular case they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose while many of the costreduction strategies mckinsey recommended at allstate remain in place some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states use of colossusedit many criticisms leveled against allstate and other insurers including barardinellis book involved the use of a software program called colossus to process claims in  allstate paid a  million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by  states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which colossus was used it also agreed to standardize its use of the
