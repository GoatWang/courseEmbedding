war times waite rawls revels in his role as the keeper of the confederacy’s complex legacy s waite rawls has a name and heritage befitting a confederate general a virginia military institute graduate he’s got so many rebel ancestors that he has a hard time remembering them all for three decades he left the south behind working as an investment banker in new york and chicago before finally returning to his native virginia after lengthy service on the civil war preservation trust’s board in  rawls became the museum of the confederacy’s president and ceo—a job he says challenges and inspires him daily how long have you been interested in the civil war i grew up in the small town of franklin va which had a civil war round table that i desperately wanted to be a member of in —when i was  and you were required to be  to be a member—they said they’d let me in if i could pass a test to go to the confederate museum in richmond and come back give them a report and answer their questions i remember walking in the front door of the moc and there were two old ladies with “white tight” buns and those laceup shoes i was scared to death but i passed the test when i got back what’s it like to be president and ceo of the museum years later the duty the responsibility to carry on here is aweinspiring i’ve never worked as hard—both in terms of hours or degree of difficulty when i came here in  i told jeb stuart iv the trustee who hired me that i’d be here until someone carried me out on a stretcher what difficulties does the moc face three things number one despite the civil war’s continuing popularity in political and in donor circles it’s almost like an electric third rail convincing people that we are a credible educational institution is a much big­ger challenge than i anticipated number two we were in worse financial shape than i anticipated we’re in much better financial shape today and are growth oriented all our strategic plans are kept on my computer in a file labeled “seven days” because i said we should be tired of playing defense let’s play offense for a change we’ve been playing offense for six years and have made tremendous progress the third thing is it’s been an extraordinarily difficult environment in which to raise dollars but we’ve done it we’ve got a record this year in membership and annual fund we’ve raised well over  million toward our appomattox project what’s the biggest challenge for the museum in the st century there are two big challenges one is to make the civil war relevant to the st century i get inspired by great quotes from great people like “you don’t know your future if you don’t know your past” the other thing is to convince the general public that the confederacy and racism are not synonymous terms in the past  years the general public has been putting those two together when they come here we tend to open their eyes i look at the virtue the courage the selfsacrifice of the typical confederate soldier as inspiring and uplifting and trying to cram that person into a pigeonhole of racism is just completely wrong explain the plan to develop three additional museum sites in richmond we are “locationally challenged” our historic location at the white house of the confederacy has become overshadowed by urban growth making it difficult for visitors to come to us we had an epiphany—we should take the museum to the people during a trip to appomattox they told us how many people come to visit that site in my mind i said “appomattox is in the middle of nowhere” yet places like appomattox are where civil war times readers want to go what better place to show our artifacts than the locations where they were made famous when will the appomat­tox court house location open in  following that will be one in the fredericksburg region and then fort monroe what is it— percent—of all casualties happened within  miles of fredericksburg you cannot find a place particularly from a combat point of view more appropriate than fredericksburg and there’s so much history in fort monroe before during and after the war whether it’s jefferson davis’ imprisonment or the contraband decision or the fact that robert e lee built the fort or it was the launching place for the seven days’ campaign did any of your ancestors fight for the confederacy yes i can’t count them all either in virginia or north carolina my greatgreatuncle abner pease was a captain who ended up commanding the rd north carolina at the surrender at appomattox but my greatgrandfather rawls was a private all four years he stopped going to the reunions because he said he was convinced that he was the only private in the whole confederate army since during the reunions they would promote everybody—and he never got promoted even at the reunions he was wounded twice served through all four years and wrote his memoirs in  three pages long handwritten in may  his unit left norfolk with  men they returned from sharpsburg with  his description “they got shot to pieces” from his account of the sharpsburg campaign it’s apparent they were on south mountain then in the bloody lane but he just writes “and then we went to maryland and had two bloody fights and then we came home” i just donated the tin cup that he took home from appomattox to the museum what confederate would you like to spend an hour with jubal early is a trip a bad old man cursing a blue streak hated women hated the “buttermilk cavalry” never shied away from a fight what a colorful person he was another one is general william “little billy” mahone here’s this scrawny little skinny short guy with so many health problems that he’s carrying chickens and cows with him to all the battlefields—who’s kind of hidden under lt gen richard h anderson’s hat for two years finally after the wilderness and into the overland campaign for the last year of the war his is the best fighting unit in the confederate army and the fact that he’s from franklin my hometown he went to vmi and my great grandfather fought for him doesn’t hurt here’s a good story once when he was wounded his wife was informed about his injury but told not to worry because it was only a flesh wound her response was “but billy has no flesh” after the war he was a big railroad consolidator he put together what became the norfolk  western but he did an amazing job in the  years after the war of getting all the railroads in virginia up that was at the peak of competition to get coal from the west to ports in the east then there was his role in the re­adjustor party he became a republican he courted black voters he did a lot for newly freed men—and he was very controversial because he was no straightline democrat like so many of the southern generals did you think much about the war while you lived in the north yes and no i’ve always loved books but for awhile i was reading dumb novels then on a business trip to england i finished a book in heathrow airport and i said “i’ll go get a robert ludlum novel” i was on about page  when i realized i had read it before i was so disgusted that i’d wasted my time it was like a light went on i said “i’m wasting my time reading all this junk give me my civil war books again” i’ve never looked back what item in the museum’s collection inspires you most on tough days i go down and watch people look at robert e lee’s uniform by their facial expressions i can tell they know they’re in the presence of something important it gives my life meaning to see that facebook twitter linkedin pinterest
