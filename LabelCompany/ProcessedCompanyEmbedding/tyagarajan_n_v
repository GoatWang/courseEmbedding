first published fri sep     pm ist on target tyagarajan joined ge because he wanted a career not just a job and became an architect of the bpo business in india jayachandran  mint updated fri sep     pm ist it’s am on a friday and the staff on duty at the trident gurgaon are beginning to get suspicious of me i’ve been ambling about and shuffling a sheaf of papers for the past  minutes circling one of the lobby’s corner sofas like a predator patrolling his territory i’m a bit early for my breakfast meeting with nv tyagarajan the yearold chief operating officer of the business process outsourcing bpo firm genpact and the staff would really appreciate it if i stopped wearing out the carpet in the interim thank you very much dressed in a crisp dark grey suit and wheeling a suitcase tyagarajan is the very image of the roving executive his handshake is firm “hi i’m tiger” he says by way of introduction on target tyagarajan joined ge because he wanted a career not just a job and became an architect of the bpo business in india jayachandran  mint the story of how “tiger” became his prefix of choice it’s even on his visiting card takes him back nearly  years “i went to a catholic school in mumbai and in the second grade we came out of a poetry class having just learnt tiger tiger burning bright by william blake” he says the name “tyagarajan” was proving a little too phonetically complex for his mumbai classmates and “tiger” filled that gap competently “it’s not a bad name to have in the corporate world” he says it is tyagarajan’s approach to business that has undoubtedly made the name stick “it’s the way you attack a problem” he says softly carefully measuring each sentence before speaking “break it down into parts think about a logical rational stepbystep solution—that’s the way i think about a lot of things” it’s an unnervingly precise mechanism for decisionmaking but “unnervingly precise” is an accurate descriptor for tyagarajan’s career from his early days in pond’s india to being the coo of the  billion around rs crore employee genpact which was previously called ge capital international services or gecis and was a captive arm of general electric tyagarajan orders a “strong” masala chai “drink of choice” i ask “not really” he says his wispy moustache curling as he breaks into a grin “but i’ve had two espressos since morning so i thought i’d take a break from coffee” the early proofofconcepts for gecis the prototype for the indian bpo industry were beginning to float around in  when tyagarajan was working with ge capital he along with other bpo pioneers raman roy and pramod bhasin conducted pilots “basic call centre stuff” that became hugely successful it excited then ge boss jack welch when he visited in  till  gecis remained moored to the ge port providing bpo services only to inhouse companies tyagarajan meanwhile left for the us in  to work with ge commercial finance he returned when gecis became genpact an independent company by then bpo had become a buzzword “when you’ve built a company and a concept up from scratch you look at your job and your career much differently” he says “we’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg with bpos” he says “i can see myself doing this particular job for at least  more years” a student of mechanical engineering at iit bombay in the early s tyagarajan homed in on his interest early “i didn’t see myself joining the engineering cadre and designing stuff” he says “commercial decisions attracted me working with a team attracted me” iim ahmedabad followed and in  tyagarajan landed his first job as sales manager in what was then pond’s india “i was very clear that i didn’t want to join brands and product management to begin with i wanted to hit the road and hit the ground” he says pond’s allowed him to do just that “i loved the culture of the company it was actionoriented and gave far more importance to sales than to the brand that attracted me i’m older and wiser now and i understand the importance of brands but back then it was just wishywashy stuff” he joined the western region office in mumbai and within a week was on the road in madhya pradesh talcum powder was pond’s star performer there commanding up to  of the market share in certain areas tyagarajan quickly settled in dealing with salespersons stockists and other wizened veterans of the talcum powder trade “i spent sixandahalf years there and loved every second of it” he says he moved to citibank in  joining its mortgage business in chennai after six months in sales and marketing he decided to switch tracks to the operations side “i thought operations was the gateway to a wider career” he says within a year he got a chance to make that shift “someone tapped me on the shoulder and said ‘there’s a credit and collections job in the west mumbai i think you should do it’ i asked why and they said ‘it’s a mess we’d like you to go and clean it up’ that to me was an interesting comment to make to someone who’s never done that stuff before” tyagarajan says after this stint in mumbai tyagarajan was posted to delhi his wife viji then working for abn amro and their son abhinav who was born in  stayed on in mumbai “three cities six jobs six portfolios four years typical citibank career in those days” in  he left citibank to join ge capital a company he’d been fascinated with since its entry into india “with ge i saw the opportunity to build a year career” he says “i actually thought this way i could be doing credit cards one day and aircraft engines the next changing jobs without changing the company” he joined as risk head for ge’s joint venture with hdfc ltd called countrywide when gecis started in  he moved to delhi “and for the second time i moved and my wife didn’t move” he laughs “viji was working at rabobank and she joined me only after  months when she moved to aviva” in those  months tyagarajan immersed himself completely in gecis often drowning out the mutinous protests of his team who wished he’d “move back to mumbai” “i worked like crazy” he recalls “but those were the formative years our target was  people employees and by the time i left for the us in  we had ” “work is a big part of who i am” he says tyagarajan spends almost  days a month travelling on business a routine that leaves him with precious little time at home “i probably do not spend enough time at home as i should” he says “it’s always a challenge” he went recently on a day vacation to china with his family but admits that his ideal holiday would be staying put but every workaholic has a weakness and tyagarajan is no exception “i’m an unbelievably passionate follower of cricket” he says i ask him to describe just how big a fan he is he replies almost immediately “i would bunk work if there’s a good match on” share tweet first published fri sep     pm ist more topics business lounge  nv tyagarajan  genpact  ge capital international services  bpo industry  latest

than once when his predecessor and founder of genpact a ge company till  pramod bhasin decided to hang his boots tiger was the obvious successor his name had been doing the rounds for quite some time and it was no surprise when bhasin passed on the baton to tiger but how is his third stint as ceo going to be different for starters when he left ge capital international services gecis as ceo in  it had only  employees now in its independent avatar genpact employs over  people moreover tiger is taking over the reins of genpact at a time when the bpo giant has already stepped on the growth accelerator with the acquisition of headstrong which gave the company additional it muscle it is well placed to compete with the it giants head on an mba from iimahemedabad tiger started his career

business to india in  bhasin founded ge capital international services gecis now genpact it was under him that ge hired raman roy to spearhead the voice bpo in india when roy left the organisation to start his own venture ge appointed tiger as the ceo of gecis in  according to roy “tiger is a hardworking and a clearheaded person he puts in a lot of effort is a team player and a people’s man all that augurs very well for genpact now especially after their headstrong acquisition” living up to his reputation of being a team builder tiger built a team of  in just three years when he had joined gecis in  he was managing a team of  the vision was to have  people in the next five years a target he surpassed industry insiders also view tiger as a good manager while bhasin is more of an entrepreneur tiger is a team man even bhasin exudes confidence in him saying “he is the right person to take genpact forward in its next stage of growth” he is hailed as one of the pioneers who transformed gecis into a highend business services and technology solutions company with over  billion in revenues serving global enterprises in the banking  finance insurance manufacturing transportation and businessservices sectors in october  he was transferred within ge to its multibilliondollar commercial equipment finance division six sigma and global operations as a senior vicepresident the very next year gecis sold  per cent stake to general atlantic partners and oak hill capital partners in  and was renamed genpact tiger rejoined genpact in  as an executive vicepresident based in new york city and was promoted to the position of coo in  the coo’s position was specifically created by genpact to make the transition smooth genpact is one of the few
