and business risks that cause their prices to fluctuate investors acquire shares of the fund on a securities exchange at market value which fluctuates according to the dynamics of supply and demand

susceptible to the factors affecting those particular types of companies including government regulation inflation cost increases in fuel and other operating expenses technological innovations that may render existing products and equipment obsolete and increasing interest rates resulting in high interest costs on borrowings needed for capital construction programs including costs associated
