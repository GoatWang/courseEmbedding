sound build quality and outstanding comfortread more being in the bandread more high expectations more than metread more customer reviews  items great sound build quality and outstanding comfort overall i have had these headphones for  months now and have barley showed any sign of wear which is impressive considering they are used on a daily basis for hours on end these headphones reproduce sound amazing well in comparison to audiotechnicas athm and grados sre not saying both of these are bad the build quality feels and performs great from the metal construction and leather ear pads their comfort is plainly amazing from their light weight comfortable ear pads and shape and unexpectedly their sound canceling is greater than i imagined and felt the dual  mm jacks were a pleasant convenience in my mind these are the perfect headphones that are firmly worthy of the cost review by corefinder  posted on  being in the band overall the balance detail vocal or instrumental background separation and clarity are delivered in excellent isolation the sense of being in the band is prominent and for me a step up from listening or attending to sound exclusively review by flint  posted on  high expectations more than met overall have been a koss fan since my first set of proaas in the late s those were followed up by proxs and then portapros urs and btis each better than the last then i purchased a set of these for my oldest son as a christmas gift to be his rd set of koss stereophones and asked for a listenblown away those who dont realize that these are tuned for studio  production work may not expect the flat response across the full spectrum these deliver possibly expecting the overdriven bass of some competing brands the balance is what brings every detail out with stunning clarity and has me hearing things i have never noticed in music i have listened to hundreds of times couple this with light weight koss quality and warranty and good looks and the pros is impossible to beat even at far greater cost review by oldschoolsound  posted on  outstanding overall this is the third pair of koss phones i have owned without a doubt the best sounding phones i have owned to date also the most comfortable phones highly recommended review by hoffie  posted on  great phones for the studio overall i have used koss headphones for many years in my recording studio my pro aa are my studio workhorses i bought the pros just to check my mixes with and could not believe how flat they were i do not care for the detachable cable it falls out all the time if koss comes out with the pros element  slx  in headphones with a attached cable i would be buying a few of them review by mie  posted on  holographic imaging overall i believe in the koss brand for many reasons incredible sound quality history and that lifetime warranty i figured these cans would be something special but i am blown away by the rich full sound i knew based on the frequency range that these can get low but its the beautiful highs that delight the senses you cant go wrong with these as they are also easily driven by all types of devices my nexus  required an amp to be heard properly but not with these review by gboogie  posted on  beautiful overall these babies remind me quite a bit of my old proaaa which i still use and cherish best new koss product in decades i spend a

though but they are very light and comfortable the bottom line is that they sound amazing review by shane  posted on  the headphone equivalent of the monolith from  a space odyssey overall these electrostatic headphones are an incredible value objectively providing broadband linearity and a uniform amplitude response across the key audible spectrum orthogonal transducersespecially of the electrostatic variety like this are generally many thousands of dollars as an entry price point in comparison the esps transducers have an enormous planar area  one of the largest ever in a pair of headphones to my knowledge  they cover the sides of your head from hair to jawline despite this they are very lightweight the mylar diaphragm is so thin it is transparent and are truly an open headphone in a sense that traditional dynamic headphones simply cannot claim to be the resulting sound is not only highly accurate the massive scale and transparent airiness combines to provide a truly breathtaking listening experience while many headphones claim to reproduce the experience of listening at a concert these do a better job than most speakers of that scale can claim   its more like listening to your recordings as they sounded in the studio itself finally the lifetime warranty on these is excellent peace of mind i simply couldnt imagine investing this much into a pair of headphones without having koss legendary warranty to back it up review by ian  posted on  still great after  years of use overall i purchased these back in  other than ear pad replaments they have been flawless these are still the best headphones i have ever owned they are very smooth from top to bottom plenty of detail with the as well the bass is well extended not boomy the mids are as clean

“company” means koss corporation and its former consolidated whollyowned subsidiary koss classics ltd “koss classics” which was dissolved in the three months ended september    the company was incorporated in delaware in    the company operates in the audiovideo industry segment of the home entertainment industry through its design manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related accessory products  the company reports its results as a single reporting segment as the company’s principal business line is the design manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related accessories   the company’s products are sold through national retailers international distributors audio specialty stores the internet direct mail catalogs regional department store chains discount department stores grocery stores electronics retailers military exchanges and prisons under the “koss” name  the company also sells products to distributors for resale to school systems and directly to other manufacturers for inclusion with their own products  the company has more than  domestic dealers and its products are carried in approximately  domestic retail outlets and numerous retailers worldwide  international markets are served by domestic sales representatives and a sales office in switzerland which utilizes independent distributors in several foreign countries    approximately  of the company’s fiscal  sales were for stereo headphones for listening to music  the remaining  of the companys sales were for headphones used in communications education settings and in conjunction with metal detectors the products are not significantly differentiated by their retail sales channel or application with the exception of products sold to school systems and prisons  there are no other product line differentiations other than the quality of the sound produced by the stereo headphone itself which is highly subjective in fiscal year  the company launched the striva products which allow the consumer to listen to the stereo headphones directly from the world wide web using wifi these products are sold through the koss website   the company sources complete stereo headphones manufactured to its specifications from various manufacturers in asia as well as raw materials used to produce stereo headphones at its plant in milwaukee wisconsin  management believes that it has sources of complete stereo headphones and raw materials that are adequate for its needs   there are no employment or compensation commitments between the company and its dealers  the company has several independent manufacturers’ representatives as part of its distribution efforts  the company typically signs one year contracts with these manufacturers’ representatives  the arrangements with foreign distributors do not contemplate that the company pays any compensation other than any profit the distributors make upon their sale of the company’s products   intellectual property   john c koss is recognized for creating the stereo headphone industry with the first sp stereo headphone in   the company regularly applies for registration of its trademarks in many countries around the world and over the years the company has had numerous trademarks registered and patents issued in north america south america asia europe africa and australia  the company currently has approximately  trademarks registered in  countries around the world and  patents in  countries  the company has trademarks to protect the brand name koss and its logo on its products  the company also holds many design patents that protect the unique visual appearance of some of its products  these trademarks and patents are important to differentiate the company from its competitors  certain of the company’s trademarks are of material value and importance to the conduct of its business  the company considers protection of its proprietary developments important however the company’s business is not in the opinion of management materially dependent upon any single trademark or patent  during the year ended june    the company took steps to update and monitor its patents and trademarks to protect its intellectual property around the world    seasonality   although retail sales of consumer electronics have typically been higher during the holiday season stereo headphones have also seen increased purchases throughout the year  management believes that the companys business and industry segment are no longer seasonal as evidenced by the fact that net sales for the year ended june   were almost equally split between the first and second halves of the year  management believes that the reason for this level performance of sales to retailers and distributors is related to the fact that stereo headphones have become replacement items for portable electronic products  therefore upgrades and replacements appear to have as much interest over the course of the year as gifts of stereo headphones during the holiday season   working capital and backlog   the company’s working capital needs do not differ substantially from those of its competitors in the industry and generally reflect the need to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet delivery requirements of its customers  from time to time although rarely the company may extend payment terms to its customers for a special promotion  for instance the company has in the past offered a  day payment period for certain customers such as computer retailers and office supply stores  based on historical trends management does not expect these practices to have a material effect on net sales or net income  the company’s backlog of orders as of june   is not significant in relation to net sales during fiscal year  or projected fiscal year  net sales   customers   the company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music dvd’s in vehicles sound bytes on computer systems and other audio related media  the company distributes these products through retail channels in the us and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world  the company markets its products to approximately  domestic retailers and numerous retailers worldwide  during fiscal year   the company’s sales to its largest single customer tura scandinavia ab were approximately  of net sales and sales to walmart accounted for  of net sales  in fiscal year   net sales to tura scandinavia ab and walmart accounted for  and  of net sales respectively  the company is dependent upon its ability to retain a base of retailers and distributors to sell the company’s line of products  loss of retailers and distributors means loss of product placement  the company has broad distribution across many channels including specialty stores mass merchants and electronics stores  management believes that any loss of revenues would be partially offset by a corresponding decrease on a percentage basis in expenses thereby partially reducing the impact on the company’s income from operations  the five largest customers of the company including tura scandinavia ab and walmart accounted for approximately  and  of total net sales in fiscal years  and   respectively the recently launched striva product line is sold directly to consumers through the koss website this product line was launched late in fiscal year  and sales of these products were not significant in fiscal year  or     competition   the company focuses on the stereo headphone industry  in the stereo headphone market the company competes directly with approximately five major competitors several of which are large and diversified and have greater total assets and resources than the company  the extent to which retailers and consumers view the company as an innovative vendor of high quality stereo headphone products and a provider of excellent after sales customer service is the extent to which the company maintains a competitive advantage  the company relies upon its unique sound quality workmanship brand identification engineering skills and customer service to maintain its competitive position research and development   the amount expensed on engineering and research activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products was  during fiscal year  as compared with  during fiscal year   these activities were conducted by both company personnel and outside consultants  the company expects that research and development costs will continue and it is planning to introduce several new product offerings during fiscal year      environmental matters   the company believes that it has materially complied with all currently existing federal state and local statutes and regulations regarding environmental standards and occupational safety and health matters to which it is subject  during the fiscal years  and   the amounts incurred in complying with federal state and local statutes and regulations pertaining to environmental standards and occupational safety and health laws and regulations did not materially affect the company’s operating results or financial condition   employees   as of june    the company employed  people who are all nonunion  the company also engages temporary personnel   foreign sales   the company’s competitive position and risks relating to its business in foreign markets are comparable to those in the domestic market  in addition the governments of foreign nations may elect to erect trade barriers on imports  the creation of additional barriers would reduce the company’s net sales and net income  in addition any fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the pricing of the company’s products and divert customers who might choose to purchase lowerpriced less profitable products and could affect overall demand for the company’s products  for further information see part ii item  and note  to the consolidated financial statements   the company has a small sales office in switzerland to service the international export marketplace  the company is not aware of any material risks in maintaining this operation  loss of this office would result in a transfer of sales and marketing responsibility  the company sells its products to independent distributors in countries and regions outside the united states including europe the middle east africa asia south america latin america the caribbean canada and mexico  during the last two fiscal years net sales of all koss products were distributed as follows           united states         sweden       cyprus       malaysia       russia       czech republic       canada       all other countries       net sales           in addition to a manufacturing facility in milwaukee wisconsin the company uses contract manufacturing facilities in the people’s republic of china taiwan and south korea  these independent suppliers are distant from the company which means that we are at risk of business interruptions due to natural disasters war disease and government intervention through tariffs or trade restrictions that are of less concern domestically  the company maintains finished goods inventory in its us facility to mitigate this risk  the company’s goal is to stock finished goods inventory at an average of approximately  days demand per item  recovery of a single facility through replacement of a supplier in the event of a disaster or suspension of supply could take  days  the company believes that it could restore production of its top ten selling models which represent approximately  of the company’s  net sales within one year  the company is also at risk if the trade restrictions are introduced on its products based upon country of origin  in addition the company may not be able to pass along most increases in tariffs and freight charges to the company’s customers which would directly affect profits    available information   the company’s internet website is httpwwwkosscom  the company makes available free of charge through its internet website the company’s annual report on form k quarterly reports on form q current reports on form k proxy statements and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they are

expiration to june     the lease extension maintained the rent at a fixed rate of  per year and it is being accounted for as an operating lease  the company is responsible for all property maintenance insurance taxes and other normal expenses related to ownership  all facilities are in good repair and in the opinion of management are suitable and adequate for the company’s business purposes   item

anticipates it will continue to pay a quarterly dividend the decision to pay dividends and the amount of such dividends are within the sole discretion of the board of directors who meet quarterly  the decision to pay dividends will depend on the company’s operating results financial condition tax considerations alternative uses for such funds and other factors the board of directors deem relevant

financial condition and results of operations   the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations financial position cash flows indebtedness and other key financial information of the company for fiscal years  and    our mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item  financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k   overview   the company developed stereo headphones in  and has been a leader in the industry  we market a complete line of highfidelity stereo headphones speakerphones computer headsets telecommunications headsets active noise canceling stereo headphones wireless stereo headphones and compact disc recordings of american symphony orchestras on the koss classics label we operate as one business segment as headphones become more integral to use of music listening devices in the portable electronics market the business volume becomes variable throughout the year changes in volume are more dependent on adding new customers or changes in economic conditions than they are on seasonality or the traditional holiday shopping season many of the companys products could be viewed as essential by the consumer and others are more of a discretionary spend the results of the companys operations are therefore susceptible to consumer confidence and macroeconomic factors these economic factors have been evident in results during fiscal year   as a result of the unauthorized transactions that the company previously reported the company has ongoing activity to recover the amounts lost in the unauthorized transactions these activities are explained in note  to the consolidated financial statements fiscal year  summary • net sales dropped  to  on volume declines at the top two customers • gross profit as a percent of sales declined  to  due to a full year of amortization related to software

results of operations compared with    net sales for  declined due primarily to decreases in sales volume to a large distributor in europe and to two large retailers in the united sates the decline in sales to the european distributor reflected the loss of a customer for most of fiscal year   this customer was regained late in the fiscal year the decrease in the us retail market reflects the increased number of competitors in this space and product placement at key retailers increased sales at two export customers in asia helped to offset some of the decline at the european distributor and us retailers in addition new customers and introduction of new products throughout the year helped to reduce the sales declines   gross profit as a percent of sales in  was  which was  lower than   the decline in gross profit percentage was almost entirely the result of a full year of amortization of software development costs which began at the end of fiscal year   software amortization was   in fiscal year  compared to   in fiscal year   when adjusted for software amortization gross profit increased by approximately  in fiscal year   selling general and administrative expenses for  were approximately  higher than   the majority of this increase was driven by profitbased compensation and spending for marketing which increased by  and  respectively the profitbased compensation increased as a result of the lawsuit settlement against the third party which added approximately  to bonuses and profit sharing the marketing costs increased due to more online advertising and promotion costs relating to the introduction of a new line of headphones   in fiscal year   unauthorized transaction related costs increased because the company incurred higher legal fees that were contingent on the settlement of the third party lawsuit against the companys former auditors and additional costs of pursuing certain actions against other third parties included in the unauthorized

          financing activities           net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents          operating activities   during   cash provided by operations decreased primarily due to the negative changes in operating assets and liabilities offsetting the increase in net income accounts receivable increased by  as of june   compared to june   the proceeds of  from the lawsuit settlement received in july  were in accounts receivable at june   which more than offset the accounts receivable decrease from customers the legal fees related to the lawsuit settlement were  and were recorded in accrued liabilities as of june   in addition inventory increased by   inventory was higher due to stocking of new products in advance of shipments and adding inventory to support the launch of the striva product line   investing activities   cash used in investing activities was lower for  as the company made no new investments in product software compared to investments of  in   in   the company has budgeted  for tooling and leasehold improvements  the company expects to generate sufficient funds through operations to fund these expenditures   financing activities   net cash used in financing activities decreased in  because the company paid off the borrowings on its bank line of credit in   dividends paid to stockholders stayed the same at  or  per share in    the company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future  as of june    the company had no outstanding borrowings on its bank line of credit facility  on july    the company

options were exercised in  or     liquidity   in addition to capital expenditures for tooling and continued investment in software development the company has interest payments on its line of credit facility borrowings and planned normal quarterly dividend payments the company believes that cash generated from operations together with borrowings available under its credit facility provide it with adequate liquidity to meet operating requirements debt service requirements planned capital expenditures and dividend payments  management believes that the longterm outlook for the business remains positive however the company continually reevaluates new product offerings inventory levels and capital expenditures to ensure that it is effectively allocating resources in line with current market conditions  credit facility   on may   the company entered into a secured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na “lender”  the credit agreement dated may   between the company and the lender

extend the expiration to july    the company and the lender also entered into the pledge and security agreement dated may   under which the company granted the lender a security interest in substantially all of the company’s assets in connection with the company’s obligations under the credit agreement  the balance on this facility was  and  as of june   and   respectively   stock repurchase program   in april  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the company to purchase from time to time up to  of its common stock for its own account  subsequently the board of directors periodically has approved increases of between  to  in the stock repurchase program  as of june    the most recently approved increase was for additional purchases of   which occurred in october  for an aggregate maximum of   of which  had been expended through june     the company intends to effect all stock purchases either on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and intends to finance all stock purchases through its own cash flow or by borrowing for such purchases   there were no stock repurchases under the program in fiscal years  and    as of june    the board of directors has authorized the repurchase by the company of up to  in company common stock at the discretion of the chief executive officer of the company  future stock purchases under this program are dependent on management’s assessment of value versus market price   offbalance sheet arrangements   the company has no offbalance sheet arrangements other than the lease for the facility in milwaukee wisconsin which it leases from its chairman  on may    the lease was renewed for a period of five years ending june    and is being accounted for as an operating lease  the lease extension maintained the rent at a fixed rate of  per year  the company is responsible for all property maintenance insurance taxes and other normal expenses related to ownership  the facility is in good repair and in the opinion of management is suitable and adequate for the company’s business purposes   critical accounting policies   our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to doubtful accounts product returns excess inventories warranties impairment of longlived assets deferred compensation income taxes and other contingencies  we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from these estimates revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists shipment and delivery has occurred the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured  when these criteria are generally satisfied the company recognizes revenue  the company also offers certain customers the right to return products that do not meet the standards agreed with the customer  the company continuously monitors such product returns and cannot guarantee that they will continue to experience the same return rates that they have experienced in the past  any significant increase in product quality failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize   the company provides for certain sales incentives  the company records a provision for estimated incentives based upon the incentives offered to customers on product related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded  the provision is recorded as a reduction of sales  the company also records a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded  these estimates are based on historical sales  returns analysis of credit memo data and other known factors  if the historical data the company uses to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns adjustments may be required in future periods   accounts receivable   the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness as determined by the review of the customer’s current credit information  the company continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company’s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified  accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance is calculated based upon the company’s evaluation of specific customer accounts where the company has information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations  in these cases management uses its judgment based on the best available facts and circumstances and records a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected  these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved  however the ultimate collectibility of the unsecured receivable is dependent upon the financial condition of an individual customer which could change rapidly and without warning   inventories   the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost is determined using the lastin firstout “lifo” method  as of june     of the company’s inventory was valued using lifo  valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment  the company continues to use the same techniques to value inventory as have been used in the past  our customers may cancel their orders or change purchase volumes  this or certain additional actions or market developments could create excess inventory levels which would impact the valuation of our inventories  any actions taken by our customers or market developments that could impact the value of our inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations  the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical and projected usage and production requirements  if the company is not able to achieve its expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value the company would have to adjust its reserves accordingly product software development costs   product software development costs consist of costs incurred by outside parties for the development of software embedded in or used to support new products  these assets have been evaluated to ensure that the capitalized costs do not exceed the estimated net realizable value of the related products  as part of the impairment analysis we use an undiscounted cash flow model based on estimated net sales and gross profit to be derived in the future from the specific product and other estimated costs directly related to the product  amortization was started in fiscal year  with introduction of the first products at the end of april   no amortization was recorded prior to the introduction of the new products    inherent in the operating results forecasts are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates projected future costs costs to complete and projected longterm growth rates  the company performed impairment testing as of june   and  and no impairment was identified   product warranty obligations   products with the exception of striva are generally covered by a lifetime warranty  the striva products carry a  day warranty we record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior product returns experience  warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized  these warranty costs are based upon management’s assessment of past claims and current experience  however actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty   income taxes   we estimate a provision for income taxes based on the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year  if the actual results are different from these estimates adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made  additionally discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized    deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates  deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period  additionally we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred income tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the “more likely than not” criteria   new accounting pronouncements   applicable new accounting pronouncements are set forth under item  of

pricing  such adverse developments could reduce the estimated net realizable value of our product software development costs and could result in impairment or a shorter estimated life  such events

little tighter on my head though but they are very light and comfortable the bottom line is that they sound amazing review by shane  posted on  the headphone equivalent of the monolith from  a space odyssey overall these electrostatic headphones are an incredible value objectively providing broadband linearity and a uniform amplitude response across the key audible spectrum orthogonal transducersespecially of the electrostatic variety like this are generally many thousands of dollars as an entry price point in comparison the esps transducers have an enormous planar area  one of the largest ever in a pair of headphones to my knowledge  they cover the sides of your head from hair to jawline despite this they are very lightweight the mylar diaphragm is so thin it is transparent and are truly an open headphone in a sense that traditional dynamic headphones simply cannot claim to be the resulting sound is not only highly accurate the massive scale and transparent airiness combines to provide a truly breathtaking listening experience while many headphones claim to reproduce the experience of listening at a concert these do a better job than most speakers of that scale can claim   its more like listening to your recordings as they sounded in the studio itself finally the lifetime warranty on these is excellent peace of mind i simply couldnt imagine investing this much into a pair of headphones without having koss legendary warranty to back it up review by ian  posted on  still great after  years of use overall i purchased these back in  other than ear pad replaments they have been flawless these are still the best headphones i have ever owned they are very smooth from top to bottom plenty of detail with the as well the bass is well extended not boomy the mids are as clean as you can get they highs are crystalyn but not bright the only drawback i can think of is they can make the our ears sweat after a while the construction seems a bit flimsy but they have held

using these stereophones since the s when mr koss john the founder gave them to me as a giftmy dad and him were friends i was a young teenage dj at womt  radio in manitowoc wi i was the envy of the staff they all used old tinny headsets and mine sounded great i eventually i ended up in dallas and then la then back to wi and the proaas have followed me around the country theyre still awesome review by flyboy curt  posted on  durable great value overall bought my proaa in the summer of  still perform perfectly only changes have been one or two sets of ear cushions very few things i own

hall of fame overall i was an on air personality in atlanta for  years and my proaas were with me everyday i have pictures review by radio guy  posted on  great cans overall these are incredible with a xonar essence sound card the normal built in sound card in a computer doesnt have enough power for  ohm headphones but with the add in card these head phones rock just make sure you are listening to high bitrate music review by tfj  posted on  still the gold standard overall i have had a pair of these headphones for fifteen years they still sound better than nearly anything on the market and wont put you back as much as some of the flashier names even if you do have problems with them the lifetime guarnetee is there to make sure youre covered these are the only headphones i recommend for any serious work accept no substitute review by dm  posted on  there is nothing else overall i first encountered the proaas when i first started working in broadcasting as the station i worked at had  pairs and was amazed by the accuracy and durability at that time i was doing some of the longest weekend shifts and would have them on  to  hours at a time sometimes and and many hours in production and editing as well the only problem they had back then was the ear cushions were oil filled and the other problem was women and hair products the cushions would tend to harden and eventually crack because of the hair chemicals and our own natural body hair oil and sweat around that time koss implemented a improvement made with a different grade of polymer to overcome that and they are no longer oil filled our engineering department had an open account with them for parts and we did all our own repairs and i have serviced many sets through the years for either damaged cables or cushions or user imposed damages but the drivers and frames were usually never an issue and these would get beat and worked hard every day in the s i owned both a pair of double and triple as and lost them in a relationship split suffice to say i miss the headphones  i still work live sound and i have used dozens of other brands but nothing even comes close to the sound and durability of the aas and  years later i am looking at a set of the titaniums the aas are a bit heavy but thats part of their sound and what keeps them immune to the outside sounds around you and thats what real metal feels like which is why they last there is nothing better for accurate sound reproduction and detail and day in day out durability i live  miles from where they are made and they have always stood behind every piece of the products they make this is the definition of legendary which is why they have stood the test of time make no mistake there is nothing elseother than maybe a different model more suited for your needs but these were the catalyst of it all and all the other manufacturers worldwide have been chasing them ever since review by original madman john  posted on  a topgrade classic overall i bought my first pair of koss pro  aa phones back in the middle s while employed selling stereo gear they were outstanding performers then and a great value for the price and still are no wonder the model has lasted this long my original pair finally gave out in  after a year life span review by turbo  posted on  great company overall they stand behind their products  percent and their quality and value cant be beat what more can you ask for review by dj  posted on  best headphones ive ever used overall i have owned and used the proa headphones since i was in the usaf in  they were dutifully repaired one time under warranty and perform extremely well much better than other phones ive used it garbs the nuances of source and especially the transcribed music from my linn sondek turntable review by rick  posted on  design classic great sound but not for mobile devices overall i have two pairs bought approx  years apart which have radically different voice coil impedance the  pair have impedance of  ohms and the  pair  ohms i believe current production voice coils are  ohms the  ohm pair are easy to drive and give acceptable spl from ios devices and mobile phones the others do not and therefore require a portable headphone amplifier to give adequate spl on mobile devices regarding the lifetime warranty or should that read limited lifetime warranty i have had no response to my request to have both pairs repaired as the plastic guides for the headphone bands have both broken it is always very disappointing when manufacturer claims are not met i will update my review if koss honour their lifetime warranty promise review by melchet  posted on  i am speechlessthe best overall better than sennheiser and stylish vintage and absolute in performance the best koss you amazing guys and your founder my grand grand uncle was gene krupa jazz man and same great as a koss musician absolute best i love this product for outstanding quality style and price review by bo krupa  posted on  pro aa overall understand they are studio headphones extra connection port etc i bought my st set way back in late early  while in the service shipped them x across countrythey were flawless the oilfilled pads wore out bought the nd set from sam goodys in nyc after  years had no idea about the warranty at the time next set will be again proaas pros best quality sound ive had since  cons weight but i can live with it review by shooter  posted on  this is it overall to this day i wont settle for any other brand than koss  these headphones are the reason i bought mine around  in ca but they along with my entire music collection were stolen in  recommend heck yeah pros this is the ideal the one against all others are judged cons the price when i bought mine they were about  review by frostbite  posted on  pro aa overall bought these in  used them until they were worn out at least yrs had them in a cabinet for years then found out they were guaranteed for life sent them back to koss and they sent me a new set after  yrs they still stand behind their phones and they sound incredible couldnt be happier  pros company stands behind their products cons heavy but built like a tank review by randazzo  posted on  years and years of fab service overall bestest headphones ever i must have had them nearly  years and they are as good as new once one of the speakers became loose so i sent them to koss for repair  they did a full service  everything new speakers foams and cushions and at a very reasonable cost that must have been  years ago these are absolutely the best pros wonderful cons none at all review by scimitar man  posted on  koss pro aa overall when i order these shall be my th set since about  they have traveled with me through my time in the service been moved a number of times around the country in boxestrunkscartrunks only problems ive had is getting the oilfilled earpads replaced other than that they really shut out most outside noise has fullrich bass response magnificent overall sound pros magnificent sound very full range massive bass response cons they do weigh a bit more than most may care for review by soupboy  posted on  unequalled overall i purchased my aas in  and use them almost daily i have gone through several sets of pads but other than that they are still the set i go to when i want to listen to music in a busy room someday i should swap the  phone plug for the current  i tried the expensive noise canceling brand but these are more comfortable and just a quiet maybe more so pros audio quality construction cons a little heavy but weight is well distributed review by l a weber  posted on  the studio standard overall i used these phones from  till  and beyond i assume the original owner still has them they were used to record and mix tracks in our small studio along with some other types these were the favorites they isolated you from room noise and they didnt lie for the money and considering their anvillike construction it was a fine deal i hope koss still uses the same materials and methodsthough not the best sounding phones on the planet they are great for layingdown tracks use the highend jobs for mastering pros rugged good sound neutral good isolation cons heavy sonically flat can be uncomfortable review by lizard  posted on  wonderful company wonderful product overall i grew up with these headphones after my father bought them in the s they have been used abused and continued to perform flawlessly for decades over time the ear cups deflated the foam headband was lost and they began to collect dust in the basement until i heard about kosss lifetime warranty i sent them in  weeks ago and for only the cost of shipping they cleaned them up repaired the headband replaced the ear cups and installed new drivers and wire i just got them back today and i am blown away by the sound quality i would highly recommend not only these headphones but this company for their help and support and the obvious pride they take in their products even the decadesold ones im not sure that i will need new stereophones for a long time yet but if i do my next ones will be koss pros high quality amazing warrantycustomer service cons none review by berkowwm  posted on  phenomenal overall i was very excited to use these in conjunction with my old sansui receiver and yamaha cd player and the first time i plugged in i was shocked not by how good it sounded though rather how different it sounded ive always had to tinker with eq levels with other headphones usually around bass   treble   and i immediately noticed alack of bass compared to what i was used to but after a minute or two i realized i didnt need that because these phones play music the way the artistproducer wanted it to be heard proaa is incredibly balanced i am very satisfied pros extremely balanced cons weight but doesnt really matter to me with this sound quality review by jennyjenny  posted on   years and still impeccable delivery overall still crazy after all these years  pros rugged and pleasing delivery cons generous padding but could have been a touch softer review by jimmy dingle  posted on  proaa overall i have used proaa for about  years the warranty has replaced the phones several times because the joints that hold the band together comes apart and have so many gluings before i send in for repair also the insulation on the cord after several years will crack to the point of needing replacing as a licensed broadcast engineer now retired i need critical headphones that seal out the sound so that i can hear audio these headphones are excellent for critical listening and to hear problems in audio but again they are heavy and when i have filled in doing a music shift so that college students can study for term exams i find them a bit overwhelming after six hours of wearing i would use these headphones in a top notch recording studio or where critical listening is important pros good critical listening cons heavy bulky review by broadcast engineer  posted on  proaa overall i am admittedly a koss collector  i have an example of every single fullsized model of dynamic and electrostatic koss have ever made the aa is the exception  i have exactly  mint boxed examples from  to  anniversary specials  you name it ok im a koss nut i use  pairs in my professional studio and these all date from september   not a single fault in over a halfmillion hours of monitoring rock music and jazz so good theyre spooky pros everything they even smell nice cons zilch review by ventura  posted on  review update overall glad to see the return of the metal frame around the earpieces these phones are best for analog listening though digital sounds amazing as well you wont find a better headphone for the price like to see the pro  aaa’s remade as well for the revival of the vinyl lp these phones are the best companion to vinyl listening pros solid bassgorgeous midrange cons earpad foam could be better quailityknown to deteriorate review by mantooth  posted on  owned since   found nothing better overall i purchased my proaa headphones in  while i was in college in tx after auditioning many other sets at numerous highend stereo stores honestly i could have spent a lot more money but nothing sounded better than these for under   dollars during the short time that koss discontinued the proaa i had at least two professional sound engineers try to buy my set for a lot more than i originally spent for them guess what its  and i still have my original set i was ecstatic to find out that koss will still repair them im sending mine in for a rebuild and eagerly anticipating a reunion with my old friend nd generation  just bought a pair for my  year old son and he is amazed by their sound i absolutely without qualification recommend these headphones to anyone who really wants to hear everything in their music just remember to take them off every once in a while because they are a little heavy and slightly tight on the ears pros great presence low bass through high treble fantastic isolation cons weight review by sc  posted on  proaa overall i am looking at my rd set of the proaa since  pros terrific base response equally great midtreble cons weight review by soupboy  posted on  proaa overall i bought mine in high school in  theyve been with me ever since navy usage in barracks xcountry trips survived  kids went thru  pair of pads they are finally wearing out no treble on leftside and the headband is shot so another pair will be gotten for me for

warrior i have personally tried several different sets of headphones and believe me  you these koss proaa headphones beat the band hands down ps  ive been using koss audio products ever since i found them the newer products pale by comparison to the far superior koss product line pros proaa  superb listening fidelity cons none review by kevinp  posted on  how i sound in my head overall im a dj on a morning show the only issue i have is they weigh a ton and with them on my head for long periods of time they can cause discomfort duh take them off its just a habit you have to get intobut the sound quality is worth the discomfort pros isolation sound quality cons weight review by kc  posted on  koss proaa overall i first purchased these in  and am already on my rd pair the proaas are incredible sounding and rival phones twice their price the bass is tight with no muddyness and delivers the best highs youll ever hear the olive green color that was fab in the s may not appeal to everyone also the padding can be a bit uncomfortable after a few hours use dont buy into this headphone break in nonesense these sound fantastic right out of the box pros superb bass incredible

had to send them in to koss for repairs then had to send them back a second time as they broke right after i took them out of the return box now for every return from now on theyre asking me to pay

on vocals and pretty decent on playbacks beats plus very very very solid i will never miss them  review by raben muzik  posted on  been using them since the s overall ive been using these stereophones since the s when mr koss john the founder gave them to me as a giftmy dad and him were friends i was a young teenage dj at womt  radio in manitowoc wi i was the envy of the staff they all used old tinny headsets and mine sounded great i eventually i ended up in dallas and then la then back to wi and the proaas have followed me around the country theyre still awesome review by flyboy curt  posted on  durable great value overall bought my proaa in the summer of  still perform perfectly only changes have been one or two sets of ear cushions very few things i own have lasted over  years these headphones are an enduring value review by pr  posted on  have used koss proaa as a broadcaster for nearly  years overall awesome cans review by uncle john  posted on  hall of fame overall i was an on air personality in atlanta for  years and my proaas were with me everyday i have pictures review by radio guy  posted on  great cans overall these are incredible with a xonar essence sound card the normal built in sound card in a computer doesnt have enough power for  ohm headphones but with the add in card these head phones rock just make sure you are listening to high bitrate music review by tfj  posted on  still the gold standard overall i have had a pair of these headphones for fifteen years they still sound better than nearly anything on the market and wont put you back as much as some of the flashier names even if you do have problems with them the lifetime guarnetee is there to make sure youre covered these are the only headphones i recommend for any serious work accept no substitute review by dm  posted on  there is nothing else overall i first encountered the proaas when i first started working in broadcasting as the station i worked at had  pairs and was amazed by the accuracy and durability at that time i was doing some of the longest weekend shifts and would have them on  to  hours at a time sometimes and and many hours in production and editing as well the only problem they had back then was the ear cushions were oil filled and the other problem was women and hair products the cushions would tend to harden and eventually crack because of the hair chemicals and our own natural body hair oil and sweat around that time koss implemented a improvement made with a different grade of polymer to overcome that and they are no longer oil filled our engineering department had an open account with them for parts and we did all our own repairs and i have serviced many sets through the years for either damaged cables or cushions or user imposed damages but the drivers and frames were usually never an issue and these would get beat and worked hard every day in the s i owned both a pair of double and triple as and lost them in a relationship split suffice to say i miss the headphones  i still work live sound and i have used dozens of other brands but nothing even comes close to the sound and durability of the aas and  years later i am looking at a set of the titaniums the aas are a bit heavy but thats part of their sound and what keeps them immune to the outside sounds around you and thats what real metal feels like which is why they last there is nothing better for accurate sound reproduction and detail and day in day out durability i live  miles from where they are made and they have always stood behind every piece of the products they make this is the definition of legendary which is why they have stood the test of time make no mistake there is nothing elseother than maybe a different model more suited for your needs but these were the catalyst of it all and all the other manufacturers worldwide have been chasing them ever since review by original madman john  posted on  a topgrade classic overall i bought my first pair of koss pro  aa phones back in the middle s while employed selling stereo gear they were outstanding performers then and a great value for the price and still are no wonder the model has lasted this long my original pair finally gave out in  after a year life span review by turbo  posted on  great company overall they stand behind their products  percent and their quality and value cant be beat what more can you ask for review by dj  posted on  best headphones ive ever used overall i have owned and used the proa headphones since i was in the usaf in  they were dutifully repaired one time under warranty and perform extremely well much better than other phones ive used it garbs the nuances of source and especially the transcribed music from my linn sondek turntable review by rick  posted on  design classic great sound but not for mobile devices overall i have two pairs bought approx  years apart which have radically different voice coil impedance the  pair have impedance of  ohms and the  pair  ohms i believe current production voice coils are  ohms the  ohm pair are easy to drive and give acceptable spl from ios devices and mobile phones the others do not and therefore require a portable headphone amplifier to give adequate spl on mobile devices regarding the lifetime warranty or should that read limited lifetime warranty i have had no response to my request to have both pairs repaired as the plastic guides for the headphone bands have both broken it is always very disappointing when manufacturer claims are not met i will update my review if koss honour their lifetime warranty promise review by melchet  posted on  i am speechlessthe best overall better than sennheiser and stylish vintage and absolute in performance the best koss you amazing guys and your founder my grand grand uncle was gene krupa jazz man and same great as a koss musician absolute best i love this product for outstanding quality style and price review by bo krupa  posted on  pro aa overall understand they are studio headphones extra connection port etc i bought my st set way back in late early  while in the service shipped them x across countrythey were flawless the oilfilled pads wore out bought the nd set from sam goodys in nyc after  years had no idea about the warranty at the time next set will be again proaas pros best quality sound ive had since  cons weight but i can live with it review by shooter  posted on  this is it overall to this day i wont settle for any other brand than koss  these headphones are the reason i bought mine around  in ca but they along with my entire music collection were stolen in  recommend heck yeah pros this is the ideal the one against all others are judged cons the price when i bought mine they were about  review by frostbite  posted on  pro aa overall bought these in  used them until they were worn out at least yrs had them in a cabinet for years then found out they were guaranteed for life sent them back to koss and they sent me a new set after  yrs they still stand behind their phones and they sound incredible couldnt be happier  pros company stands behind their products cons heavy but built like a tank review by randazzo  posted on  years and years of fab service overall bestest headphones ever i must have had them nearly  years and they are as good as new once one of the speakers became loose so i sent them to koss for repair  they did a full service  everything new speakers foams and cushions and at a very reasonable cost that must have been  years ago these are absolutely the best pros wonderful cons none at all review by scimitar man  posted on  koss pro aa overall when i order these shall be my th set since about  they have traveled with me through my time in the service been moved a number of times around the country in boxestrunkscartrunks only problems ive had is getting the oilfilled earpads replaced other than that they really shut out most outside noise has fullrich bass response magnificent overall sound pros magnificent sound very full range massive bass response cons they do weigh a bit more than most may care for review by soupboy  posted on  unequalled overall i purchased my aas in  and use them almost daily i have gone through several sets of pads but other than that they are still the set i go to when i want to listen to music in a busy room someday i should swap the  phone plug for the current  i tried the expensive noise canceling brand but these are more comfortable and just a quiet maybe more so pros audio quality construction cons a little heavy but weight is well distributed review by l a weber  posted on  the studio standard overall i used these phones from  till  and beyond i assume the original owner still has them they were used to record and mix tracks in our small studio along with some other types these were the favorites they isolated you from room noise and they didnt lie for the money and considering their anvillike construction it was a fine deal i hope koss still uses the same materials and methodsthough not the best sounding phones on the planet they are great for layingdown tracks use the highend jobs for mastering pros rugged good sound neutral good isolation cons heavy sonically flat can be uncomfortable review by lizard  posted on  wonderful company wonderful product overall i grew up with these headphones after my father bought them in the s they have been used abused and continued to perform flawlessly for decades over time the ear cups deflated the foam headband was lost and they began to collect dust in the basement until i heard about kosss lifetime warranty i sent them in  weeks ago and for only the cost of shipping they cleaned them up repaired the headband replaced the ear cups and installed new drivers and wire i just got them back today and i am blown away by the sound quality i would highly recommend not only these headphones but this company for their help and support and the obvious pride they take in their products even the decadesold ones im not sure that i will need new stereophones for a long time yet but if i do my next ones will be koss pros high quality amazing warrantycustomer service cons none review by berkowwm  posted on  phenomenal overall i was very excited to use these in conjunction with my old sansui receiver and yamaha cd player and the first time i plugged in i was shocked not by how good it sounded though rather how different it sounded ive always had to tinker with eq levels with other headphones usually around bass   treble   and i immediately noticed alack of bass compared to what i was used to but after a minute or two i realized i didnt need that because these phones play music the way the artistproducer wanted it to be heard proaa is incredibly balanced i am very satisfied pros extremely balanced cons weight but doesnt really matter to me with this sound quality review by jennyjenny  posted on   years and still impeccable delivery overall still crazy after all these years  pros rugged and pleasing delivery cons generous padding but could have been a touch softer review by jimmy dingle  posted on  proaa overall i have used proaa for about  years the warranty has replaced the phones several times because the joints that hold the band together comes apart and have so many gluings before i send in for repair also the insulation on the cord after several years will crack to the point of needing replacing as a licensed broadcast engineer now retired i need critical headphones that seal out the sound so that i can hear audio these headphones are excellent for critical listening and to hear problems in audio but again they are heavy and when i have filled in doing a music shift so that college students can study for term exams i find them a bit overwhelming after six hours of wearing i would use these headphones in a top notch recording studio or where critical listening is important pros good critical listening cons heavy bulky review by broadcast engineer  posted on  proaa overall i am admittedly a koss collector  i have an example of every single fullsized model of dynamic and electrostatic koss have ever made the aa is the exception  i have exactly  mint boxed examples from  to  anniversary specials  you name it ok im a koss nut i use  pairs in my professional studio and these all date from september   not a single fault in over a halfmillion hours of monitoring rock music and jazz so good theyre spooky pros everything they even smell nice cons zilch review by ventura  posted on  review update overall glad to see the return of the metal frame around the earpieces these phones are best for analog listening though digital sounds amazing as well you wont find a better headphone for the price like to see the pro  aaa’s remade as well for the revival of the vinyl lp these phones are the best companion to vinyl listening pros solid bassgorgeous midrange cons earpad foam could be better quailityknown to deteriorate review by mantooth  posted on  owned since   found nothing better overall i purchased my proaa headphones in  while i was in college in tx after auditioning many other sets at numerous highend stereo stores honestly i could have spent a lot more money but nothing sounded better than these for under   dollars during the short time that koss discontinued the proaa i had at least two professional sound engineers try to buy my set for a lot more than i originally spent for them guess what its  and i still have my original set i was ecstatic to find out that koss will still repair them im sending mine in for a rebuild and eagerly anticipating a reunion with my old friend nd generation  just bought a pair for my  year old son and he is amazed by their sound i absolutely without qualification recommend these headphones to anyone who really wants to hear everything in their music just remember to take them off every once in a while because they are a little heavy and slightly tight on the ears pros great presence low bass through high treble fantastic isolation cons weight review by sc  posted on  proaa overall i am looking at my rd set of the proaa since  pros terrific base response equally great midtreble cons weight review by soupboy  posted on  proaa overall i bought mine in high school in  theyve been with me ever since navy usage in barracks xcountry trips survived  kids went thru  pair of pads they are finally wearing out no treble on leftside and the headband is shot so another pair will be gotten for me for fathers day pros survivors cons heavy but you build muscles in yer neck review by larry  posted on  koss overall superior construction durable and built to last not for the weak of heart weekend warrior i have personally tried several different sets of headphones and believe me  you these koss proaa headphones beat the band hands down ps  ive been using koss audio products ever since i found them the newer products pale by comparison to the far superior koss product line pros proaa  superb listening fidelity cons none review by kevinp  posted on  how i sound in my head overall im a dj on a morning show the only issue i have is they weigh a ton and with them on my head for long periods of time they can cause discomfort duh take them off its just a habit you have to get intobut the sound quality is worth the discomfort pros isolation sound quality cons weight review by kc  posted on  koss proaa overall i first purchased these in  and am already on my rd pair the proaas are incredible sounding and rival phones twice their price the bass is tight with no muddyness and delivers the best highs youll ever hear the olive green color that was fab in the s may not appeal to everyone also the padding can be a bit uncomfortable after a few hours use dont buy into this headphone break in nonesense these sound fantastic right out of the box pros superb bass incredible midrange cons a bit heavy padding could be improved review by mantooth  posted on  clarity clarity clarity overall i remember they had great low end tremendous midrange a very popular headphone of the s the pro aa headphones are equal with sennheiser hd dries and akg m headphones pros comfort midrange and intelligent imaging cons bulky not a sleeping headphone review by chokely  posted on  headphones pro  aa overall if you are looking for incredible headphones this is it period do you get it period pros incredible cons none review by audio nut  posted on  excellence personified overall i have owned three of these headphones over the last forty years and have never found another headphone to come close to their performance my son and grandson also swear by them both are professional musicians i really dont want to use any other headphones  and often prefer listening through my koss headphones over using my bose speaker system for music and movies pros great isolation accurate sound reproduction solid bass clear highs cons weight review by old but wise  posted on  brilliant headphones overall i inherited this pair of proaas from my great grandfather who bought them back in the s and theyve been working well ever since they are certainly some of the best sounding headphones that i have ever used with full response even down to  hz i lost audio in one of the earpieces and had to send them in to koss for repairs then had to send them back a second time as they broke right after i took them out of the return box now for every return from now on theyre asking me to pay for shipping which isnt really a problem considering that its a lifetime warranty pros audio quality frequency range build quality cable length lifetime warranty cons weight tightness on ears wiring review by taizo  posted on  proaa overall ive owned these headphones since their early s the lifetime warranty on these headphones is fantastic ive replaced them  times so far after about  or so years the internal wiring will somehow come loose and i start to lose sound in one of the ear cups unless i wiggle the outside wire the sound is so incredible and fantastic very accurate sounding notes pros

stay put overall of all the headphones ive tried for use at the gym biking and running these are the only pair that comfortably stay around my ears and deliver fantastic sound ive got particularly small ears so ive always had difficulty finding a pair that dont hurt and that dont fall off these are perfect just ordered a second pair review by xtinabellina  posted on  good sound but overall this headset sounds good for a pair of earbudsearclips they block out external sound and allow me to hear only what i want they fit well but after long periods of use over  minutes i get an ache at the top of the earlobe and have to take them off there is no adjustment or forming my biggest complaint is the microphone which is not my primary use but ive used this head to head with a set of oem samsung earbuds and the microphone response is muchmuch better on the oem buds the microphone has very poor voice response and little if any noise cancellation i was also disappointed with the lack of a volume control there is a call answer button but it is very difficult to press when push comes to shove i would end up choosing my oem buds over these for comfort function and microphone clarity these do have the benefit of not falling out while im exercising but end up being uncomfortable after a mere half hour review by jay m  posted on  one of the best headphones i have ever owned overall i was in the market for a pair of inexpensive headphones for when im at the gym working out or out running so i picked these up online theyre sleek and attractive very soft and lightweight and so comfortable that you forget theyre on they sit well and secure on your ears that they dont move or fall out even during the most active of workouts i bought these expecting soso sound thats just good enough for the gym but i soon learned the sound quality however is absolutely outstanding these headphones render the entire spectrum with incredible clarity from deep rumbling bass that never drowns out the sound pronounced yet crystal clear mids and crisp highs with no hint of distortion i hear details in some of my favorite songs that would otherwise be drowned out and muddied by other headphones of lesser quality the soft earpieces are made to sit just on the outside of the ear canal and do an impressive job of sealing out ambient noise that being said you can enjoy the amazing sound quality of these headphones even at lower volumes im an hobbyist recording mixer drummer and an audiophile and i am so impressed that i may very well buy several pairs of these for general music listening and for recording purposes i have used many headphones over the years including noisecancelling bose reference akgs and studio iems and quite frankly i personally find it hard to hear the difference between these and more expensive models if you’re looking for an amazing pair of headphones at an unbeatable price these are the ones for you review by dom  posted on  write your own review

stay put overall of all the headphones ive tried for use at the gym biking and running these are the only pair that comfortably stay around my ears and deliver fantastic sound ive got particularly small ears so ive always had difficulty finding a pair that dont hurt and that dont fall off these are perfect just ordered a second pair review by xtinabellina  posted on  good sound but overall this headset sounds good for a pair of earbudsearclips they block out external sound and allow me to hear only what i want they fit well but after long periods of use over  minutes i get an ache at the top of the earlobe and have to take them off there is no adjustment or forming my biggest complaint is the microphone which is not my primary use but ive used this head to head with a set of oem samsung earbuds and the microphone response is muchmuch better on the oem buds the microphone has very poor voice response and little if any noise cancellation i was also disappointed with the lack of a volume control there is a call answer button but it is very difficult to press when push comes to shove i would end up choosing my oem buds over these for comfort function and microphone clarity these do have the benefit of not falling out while im exercising but end up being uncomfortable after a mere half hour review by jay m  posted on  one of the best headphones i have ever owned overall i was in the market for a pair of inexpensive headphones for when im at the gym working out or out running so i picked these up online theyre sleek and attractive very soft and lightweight and so comfortable that you forget theyre on they sit well and secure on your ears that they dont move or fall out even during the most active of workouts i bought these expecting soso sound thats just good enough for the gym but i soon learned the sound quality however is absolutely outstanding these headphones render the entire spectrum with incredible clarity from deep rumbling bass that never drowns out the sound pronounced yet crystal clear mids and crisp highs with no hint of distortion i hear details in some of my favorite songs that would otherwise be drowned out and muddied by other headphones of lesser quality the soft earpieces are made to sit just on the outside of the ear canal and do an impressive job of sealing out ambient noise that being said you can enjoy the amazing sound quality of these headphones even at lower volumes im an hobbyist recording mixer drummer and an audiophile and i am so impressed that i may very well buy several pairs of these for general music listening and for recording purposes i have used many headphones over the years including noisecancelling bose reference akgs and studio iems and quite frankly i personally find it hard to hear the difference between these and more expensive models if you’re looking for an amazing pair of headphones at an unbeatable price these are the ones for you review by dom  posted on  write your own review

a customer service representative for part availability and pricing secialty stereophones what is active noise reduction anr technologyactive noise reduction technology in stereophones creates an invisible shield between the listener and the droning sounds of the world by stopping low frequency noise before it reaches the ears tiny microphones are embedded in the stereophone ear cups these microphones read the surrounding low frequency noise and transmit information about those undesirable sounds to a processor in a pocket sized control case the processor in turn generates mirror image antiwaves that are  degrees out of phase and relays those antiwaves back to the stereophones when the offending sound waves encounter the waves generated by noise reduction technology the two counteract each other at the wearer’s ear the offending hum and buzz is reduced and a peaceful listening environment is created where once there was only noise lawn mowers jet engines crowded environments vacuum cleaners computer fans or any other low frequency noise below  hz can be reduced by an average of db by koss’ noise reduction stereophone the quiet zone  quiet zone noise reduction is even greater for noise below  hz offering at least db of protection against low frequency noise specifications what does frequency response meanthe range of sound reproduced by the stereophone or speaker from the lowest bass to the highest frequency the broader the frequency response range of a product the greater highs and lows it can reproducewhat does it mean when a product is amplifiedan amplified product is one that operates on its own power supply ac or batteries this applies to certain computer portable and home speakers and stereo systems conversely unamplified products must be connected to an amplified sound source in order to operatewhy is it important that a stereophone or pair of speakers be magnetically shieldedif the magnets that power a pair of stereophones or speakers were not shielded they could cause interference a distorted picture or even data loss when used with a tv vcr or computer all koss stereophones and speakers are magnetically shielded stereophone speakers are koss stereophones and computer speakers compatible with different types of computersyes koss stereophones and computer speakers will work with any computer that has a  mm headphonespeaker jack attached to its sound card or cdrom regardless of whether its a mac or a pchow can i order replacement ear cushions for my stereophonesyes replacement earcushions are available for most modelsplease select the find replacement ear cushions link on the left navigation bar to find your model for pricing and availability of discontinued products please contact our consumer sales department at usakosshow is a dual volume control different from a balance controla dual volume control incorporates volume control and balance control into one control it allows the listener to adjust the sound level in either stereophone ear cup independently of each other a balance control works in conjunction with a volume control to limit or increase the amount of sound that reaches a listener’s ear a dual volume control is also a great feature for people with partial hearing loss in one or both earswhats a dual entry cord versus a single entry corda dual entry cord splits into a y with each end attaching to an ear cup a single entry cord attaches to the stereophone at one ear cup only for greater freedom of movementwhat are the advantages of a metal headband over a plastic one or vice versait is mostly a matter of opinion each has their own benefits a metal headband is more durable over the long run while a plastic one offers greater comfort during extended listening the preference is a personal onewhat does sidefiring meansidefiring is a term used to describe earbuds that go into the ear sideways directing sound into the ear canal for improved bass responsewhat is the benefit of a dual volume controla dual volume control enables the listener to adjust the volume on each stereophone cup individually this is a great feature for those listeners who are hearing impaired in one or both earswhat is the difference between an open and a closed ear cupan open ear cup provides a more hearthrough airy sound while a closed one delivers deeper bass response most commonly a closed ear cup is paired with a closed circumaural vinyl or leatherette ear cushion for maximum isolation while listening and an open ear cup is paired with a foam ear cushion for greater sound transparencywhat is the difference between infrared and radio frequency rf cordless technologyinfrared is cordless technology that operates on a beam of infrared light transmitted from a transmitter connected to the sound source to the stereophone listeners must remain within the line of sight from the transmitter to the stereophones or the signal is broken a remote control for a tv operates on infrared technology radio frequency on the other hand operates on a radio signal transmitted from a transmitter connected to the sound source to the stereophone listeners may move freely in any direction out of sight of the transmitter up to a designated amount of space neither technology is necessarily better than the other it is mostly a matter of personal choice infrared is generally less susceptible to interference than rf while rf allows the listener to roam more freely throughout their home when considering a cordless purchase think about how you would use it if you are more inclined to listen in one room only the infrared unit offers a stronger signal with less interference if you prefer greater freedom of movement an rf unit will enable you to move about freely from room to room just as sound is subjective so is how you choose to listenwho uses a balance controlanyone who has partial hearing loss in one or both ears can use a balance control to adjust the

want to congratulate you on your professional product and will recommend them to anyone review by danielkro  posted on  hearing your music for the first time overall there is a reason these headphones have been around forever its simple they work they work so well in fact that when i put them on it was like i was listening to my music for the first time and no i wasnt listening to madonna i have heard things i had never noticed before everything is so clear and balanced i have bought numerous headphones in this price range but these are definitely the best review by arron  posted on  they

listen music without limitations and i will never use phones with noise cancelling never review by steve  posted on  excellent product overall ive been using these earphones for ages there are solid the  ohms bandwidth is the key it makes these earphones the best you get for what you pay for highly recommended review by ludobubner  posted on  just wow overall so i gotta say that a little research went a long way with these just look at the specs and youll notice the range the sensitivity is the norm so no special gear other than your smartphone and idevices needed and the lifetime warranty really a lifetime warranty if shit happens to them i am utterly pleased with these headphones for about years now and if you are into the retro look i guess these work only con is that these bleed sound so others will hear what you are listening to so please remember to listen within reason master blaster and to play good music lol enjoy review by gboggie  posted on  great sound very comfortable overall i have had these headphones for about four months the porta pros sound great with all kinds of music they have an open realistic sound which is wellbalanced they are very lightweight and comfortable as well as extremely portable the quality of construction seems very good and they come with a warranty i dont think i could be happier with these especially considering the very reasonable price review by marc  posted on  porta pro headphones overall i have owned my pair of porta pro for  years just had to order the new ear pads for them which is normal for  years of use and the pads are inexpensive the sound after  years is still impeccableand i am a bass hound and a lover of trance  blues also classic rock these headphones fulfill excellent sound in all the different music categories there durable and nothing has broken on themas for them pulling a hair from time to time no big deal i figure by having a small piece of my hair in them proves there mine per my dna if ever stolenlaugh long story short  i love them review by mark allan  posted on  best headphones for under  bucks overall ive had more than  headphones still own around  ive been using headphones since the first walkman thats almost  years ago those are better than anything else that costs up to  dollars period review by dilodilly  posted on  best headphones overall sound is amazing review by masato  posted on  input from a pro overall i recommened the porta pros to a dj onece he stated that hes never head anything like the headphones before he was impressed by the base production and the clear sound review by bryant  posted on  excellent for the price great basseq lightweight and durable overall ive been through them all  from some of the most expensive phones to the lesser priced and settled on the portapros for just about everything i do i hate earbuds and far prefer the response and quality from overtheears but theyre usually too bulky enter the koss portapro  theyre the perfect balance of earbud comfort and overtheear performance they are eqed very well no overpowering bass or compressed overcompensation for the audio spectrum like the b phones  b brand names  youll have to figure them out i use the portapros primarily as lightweight studio monitor phones as theyre so comfortable and are eqed so naturally the metal band is durable but as some others comment it can get stuck in your hair when you remove them but to me this is part of the charm of the portapros plus my hair is short so im not too concerned great warranty and support from koss all in all the best bandforbuck headphone out there in my opinion review by guywithguitars  posted on  perfeito overall eu possuo um porta pro há mais de  anos lógico que cuido dele muito bem mas o equipamento está em perfeito estado de glória pra mim é sem igual confortável excelente som o melhor review by daniel mota  posted on  wow customer support overall i had a  year old pair of porta pros that broke koss replaced under their lifetime warranty brand new pair same old beautifully balanced sound only suggestion is that koss offer a version with a microphone review by jonh  posted on  great sounding headphones for the price  metal headband needs to be redone overall as everyone says these headphones dont cease to amaze i compare them to other brands at x x x the price and they are holding their own they are so good that i can comfortably say they could be used to producewrite music on your laptop while you travel you will hear all the lows mids and highs with these headphones their sonic signature is slightly midforward and warm in the treble section rolls off a bit bass is solid and extends quite low but the metal headband catches my hair from timetotime and pulls a root out if i am not extremely careful ouch this needs a rework koss you have a winner with these headphones make a v of this which is still portable and compact but with a headband that is hairscalp friendly please if it werent for this gripe i would have given it  stars review by bongoman  posted on  very excellent product bought these several months ago and they are by far the best headphones i ever owned overall highly recommend review by kossfan  posted on  outstanding overall just got my new koss porta pro classic and i m loving them i have hooked it up to all my devices and i must say the sound is the great  if your a music lover of jazz beethoven classic rb or classic rock then you cant beat it i have a few headphones and for the money you cant go wrong looking into buying more of your product thank you tooley review by johnny  posted on  great for glasseswearers overall i end up wearing these for about  of my day at home and for work theyre so lightweight that i forget that i have them around my neck these also play nice with glasses my glasses and the headphones never rub or clack together ive had mine for half a year and listening to other small headphones now the porta pro set has noticeably better sound quality i firmly believe that humans will never create a more comfortable pair of headphones than these review by call ins  posted on  you wont believe your ears overall take what other reviewers have said about these headphones believe them and then multiply it by i found them here in review httptopchoicebestmainreviewbestheadphones  i received a pair of koss urs as a gift years ago and loved them so naturally i looked to koss again when replacing my portableonthego headphones i figured they were good especially considering that the design seems unchanged since the s which has to mean something but i also figured that this was one of those things that was just too good to be true however these are barnone the most amazing headphones i have ever put on my head listening to some of my favorite songs for the first time was one of those wow moments where you realize you have found something that changes your expectations completely the bar will be raised the instant you hear the bass response and incredible acoustic qualities of these light comfortable headphones i dont know what im impressed with the most the amazing bass the excellent stereo division or how loud they can get these things are just as amazing as most of the reviews show them to be and then a lot more i was worried about the eighties styling but in person they dont look bad at all i hate headphones that scream for attention but these dont look like that when you have them on and i have already been wearing them in public something i didnt think i would do after only seeing the picture of them online and even if theyre a bit outdated in appearance the design is so functional you wont even give looks a second thought after you put them on one thing is for sure these things have plenty of bass not too much not boomy but they seem properly tuned for listening to things without bass booster turned on which i like even with the bass settings adjusted high the bass remains clear and crisp im not sure how much power these can handle without damaging them but i listen to them very loud and they do not sound distorted or stressed at all i cant say enough good things about these portapros theyre simply amazing these are the first headphones or speakers ive had that sound absolutely awesome without adjusting the equalizer or pumping up the bass they sound good on everything from rb to country and everything inbetween ive been especially impressed that they pull the bass and highs out of a song without getting that shrill tinny treble that plagues so many headphones if there ever was a question about the quality of koss stereophones in my mind these portapros have put it to rest and made me into a lifetime customer review by alexascott  posted on  better but not the best overall its very very good phones in the field of sound but it has poor material of the cable case and even plastic of phone i was expecting to have phones in apple quality for its price review by starik  posted on  koss porta pro overall i had  pairs in about  years only  actually broke it doesnt matter what other headphones i own i keep coming back for these each and every time i have yet to find a pair of headphone at this price range of  and even more that can give me a sound like these little ones do i listened headphones that were priced at  and they are still not as good as koss porta pro the more expensive headphones yeah they have more clarity on all ranges but their sound isnt full enough it doesnt have that oomph not speaking about bass here that koss does probably the best thing about them is that even if they have ohm impedance rating they are very easy to drive i am listening them with an old iriver t you wont believe how good this player sounds without any kind of amp i own their direct rival also the sennheiser px ii but i cannot say which of them i like more they are quite different in sound signature and they complete each other very well so if you have the possibility go and buy both of them as you will not regret it bottom line one of the best headphones i have ever heard pros sound quality very comfy unique retro style cons cable quality review by alex  posted on  not best in price range simply the best overall i have used  headphones that didnt sound as good as my koss portapro headphones they are crystal clear in the upper and mid ranges and give amazing quality of sound in the bass ranges headphones are not supposed to be good if you want to hear full bass but these are forget the latest fadphones and get these unless you are wearing headphones just to show off the latest fad brand name then go ahead and spend your money on junk the portpros are the best not just for the money but for  times the money at least pros the perfect sound in all ranges especially bass cons wire to each earphone instead of one with connection to other within the set review by joeg  posted on  is koss porta pro worth overall quite nice but for me just  usd can get this  its really worth it but only for the sound and portability pros it contains a d sounds and its cheap and portable cons keep clicking hair and old fashioned design review by jobwongcheng  posted on  worth every dime overall i will always recommend them with all my heart the sound so great it beats everything at the same price after getting them in  i still have them with no visual defect pros sound head resting sound again review by daniel  posted on  best sound overall i just did a sidebyside comparison of this with the compomprable bose headphones soundtrue onear the koss sound is so good its difficult to review because its flawless the koss bass was more warm while the bose treble sounded chintzy and unreal pros light small prefect sound cons disign looks funny to me review by franky knuckles  posted on  porta pro overall i like these because they provide good portable sound without solidly plugging up your ears pros sound good really do fold light on the ears cons a little fragile review by harry  posted on  sound quality is the same as  years ago overall these onear phones are as good as any overtheear phones ive ever heard got my first pair  years ago but they got steppedon and broken got these as a gift and am once again in stereo heaven no fatigue at all from wearing these for hours on end pros ultralight wide dynamic range excellent bass and highs cons volume control removed from earlier version review by mediaace  posted on  best by far overall ive been using these since  when i was in the military i bought them because of how they looked not knowing it would have the quality of sound every time i buy something else i always come back to these special pros light easy to wear compact great bass cons none review by dabrowhnornett  posted on  beatsdres beats overall i have owned porta pros for many years the sound quality is amazing and the clarity rivals that of a bose product they fold up nicely for storage in the included pouch if anything goes wrong with them from normal use you can return them for a warranty repair save your money from the big flashy headphones these are the last set you will ever need pros quality durability warranty cons may be a bit tight during break in period review by eddie  posted on  the perfect portable overall been using these headphones since  nothing compares to sound qualityprice pros great sound quality cons none review by dimar  posted on  a real retro beauty overall i have finally found the best headphones for me and my ears nothing comes even close i hope that koss will never change the design as its perfect pros mind blowing sound light weight and portable cons none review by furtin  posted on  a gift that really keeps on giving overall received these headphones as a gift to replace old and broken koss a phones i was taken aback by their retro design but one listen to my ipod with these surprised the heck outa me perhaps the folks giving these knew about their reputation i mostly use these with an ipod and my tablet but they sound super with my stereo too i really have no complaints as there really is nothing to complain about some have commented about catching in your hair so ive fitted them for me and taped the bands with gaffers tape now there is no issue and the phones are already sized for me each time i pick them up all i can say is thanks koss for continuing to produce these wonderful headphones btw i am a musician playing bass for  years and love the bass response pros amazing sound and comfort durable retro cons pretty much none review by carlo  posted on  throwback gold overall koss has been producing these headphones since i have been alive and they are still the best dollar for dollar headphones in existence these make  headphones sound like subsonic garbage buy these or you will regret it for the rest of your life pros amazing clarity unstoppable bass built to last cons not made out of platinum and diamonds review by evilbakeoven  posted on  its a real icon overall clunky old structure hair always get caught in the head band the comfort zone won’t stay in a place where you slide them but extraordinary sound performance clear and bass rich im so happy to have this piece of history i bought my porta as a gift for my friend but after i tested the piece i changed my mind and i’m giving him another gift instead  i have it along with sony mdrv  i cant use them both and i cant get rid of one neither pros great sound  unexpected bass cons no isolation but it is what it is review by anas  posted on  a year later and still in love overall got my pair a little over a year ago and still in love with them everything just sounds better with these headphones they do a take a little more space when storing but youre definitely getting your moneys worth my mom loves her pair too pros light weight durable incredible sound cons bulky storage review by fern  posted on  you cannot beat the price and the service overall the koss porta pro is the best headphone at its price range period clean and crisp sound across all frequencies not to mention the charming bass i bought my first pair in  and a  anniversary version in  the frame of the latter broke in  so i kept them in storage not until recently did i found out that they have a limited life time warranty i sent my th anniversary

headphones comparing with many other hiend products pros clear sound deep bass solid build cons can feel a bit tight after wearing it for a long time review by ofpower  posted on  best in its class overall although i have seen these headphones many years ago i only got my st pair in  today i got my nd pair my st pair is still fully working they are the best phones in its price class beating the competitors that might cost  times more my favourite hifi phones comes from another manufacturer which costs  times more than the portapro but the portapro sounds very close to it and it is my allround phones pros clear sound good bass and high frequency cons feels a bit flimsy review by andy r  posted on   time buyer overall saw this pair on cnet as a good pick for budget headphones liked them so much i have not bought other headphones since i use these to listen to music while cooking games while gaming and whatever i need great deal for the price pros flawless sound quality light and

cushions occasionally but it is an easy process i use these with my ipod ipad and macbook pro pros fantastic full range sound light and comfortable review by california dodger  posted on  just but it overall the band was catching my hair occasionally due to the design so i shaved my head i really do like these i guess due to the open back  ventalated design of the speakers everyone can here what you are listening to its a really cool feature when you want the attention and have people to ask you what kind of phones are those i can here them all the way over here just so you can show them off not so cool when they get attention from my prof or the librarian these have a well balanced sound almost a flat line on a parametric eq test pros servicable cons has a cord like all others review by rooted superuser  posted on   years and still great overall i got these  years ago as a christmas present and they still sound brand new even when i use them for hours and hours every week ive used them for everything from listening to music video games and working on studio recordings a simple design and really great sound if any of my friends ask me about headsets this is always my first recommendation for the price its unbeatable pros clarity cons occasional hair is pulled review by jacob  posted on  portapro is king overall without doubt the best sounding earphones youll ever hear for the price i am a bass player and have fairly high demands when it comes to the bottom end and it has always been the portapro i turn to when i really want to listen to a track in sweet hifidelity crystal clear highs from the k tops but the real cream here for me is the bass response  down to k without any hint of boominess or floppiness  just tight wellrounded bass you will find the odd track or two that might need a bottom end boost but i can guarantee this will be the source file and not the headphones try not to listen to anything less than kbps in these beauties otherwise you will hear the limitations of compressed file formats pros sound weight small form factor cons foam ear covers cord length review by rawnet  posted on  best headphones ive ever tried overall absolutely the greatest headphone i have ever tried best sound cross genres pros sound cons looks review by dubord  posted on  heaven on the ears overall once you get by the body and the simplicity of the construction these are the best ever over the ear headphones i have ever purchased i wore them to work out and they were a trooper except the sweat caused the sleeve to rust and then the ear piece broke i had them for three years and i used them constantly when they broke i sent  to koss for handling and shipping and they replaced them they are by far the best sounding and most comfortable headphones i have ever owned if there were some way to add noise cancelling to these they would rival the expensive brands pros lightweightcomfortablegreat sound cons looks  not noise cancelling review by drstp  posted on  small size big sound overall just got my koss portapro headphones in and i thought this has to be a joke these are dinky the website and youtube reviews were good but for a moment there when i pulled them out of the package i thought i had made a major mistake a plain metal ribbon headband with small speakers that fold up into a size not much larger than a tennis ball and a thread like cord that looks like it would be more appropriate for ear buds than headphones then i listened to them ive had more expensive headphones that didnt come close to the portapro hearing is believing only my  year old koss proaa has a broader sound spectrum at twice the price and much more than twice the weight because of the weight i wouldnt wear the heavy proaa for anywhere near as long as the portapro i can see why reviews online rate these as high as other brands nameless here that sell for three times as muchor more apologies for the blurb but im impressed im sorry now i waited so long to try them out pros lightweight compact size broad spectrum sound cons looks flimsy cord looks vulnerably thin cord is occasionally too short review by tchas  posted on  amazing

just simply amazing pros excellent clear sound cons none review by maniac  posted on  wonderful amazing overall im a professional musician and i do my studio recordings and monitoring with different headphones and speakers im really surprised with portapro for quality and strength of design and sound quality and precision the depth of the bass and treble detail produce a threedimensional sound which compares reality with recorded playback these are awesome are also so comfortable and lighter in a few minutes you forget you have them on and allows you to listen to natural sound pros portable comfortable perfect sound beautiful design and amazing price cons none review by pablo q m  posted on  incredible overall i got these for their portability initially i expected these to have tincan sound but it turns out to sound even better than my overear headphones the midbass and midrange sounded incredibly smooth and vocals feel so real the highs are pretty good too but the bass drowns it out a bit but is easily remedied by using an equalizer to tone down the bass these cans also have a large vertical soundstage the only negative with the portapros is the massive sound leakage overall ill definitely buy these again pros clear good soundstage bassy portapro durable cons slightly warm review by andy  posted on  excellent choice overall am glad to see koss still makes these headphones ive had mine for  years or more and still love them excellent sound quality light weight minimal bulk koss stands behind them solidly as i did have them repaired once all other light weight phones

the portapros were still being sold i almost picked them up in  but got the tnt instead after reading the reviews i figured i should try them out turns out the choice was correct they are one of the most comfortable headphones i have ever worn they are lighter and smaller than they appear online sound quality is fantastic bass is awesome and not boomy highs are crisp but not grating like on some other headphones i have many pairs of headphones from over the ear sennheisers on the ear jvcs and inear panasonics that i alternated depending on the music and environment the porta pros have pretty much relegated them to the drawer i love the retro look no one around me has phones that look like mine and i think that is great pros solid bass comfortable cons none review by saltyspoon  posted on

pleased i compared their sound to much more expensive brandsmodels these are great especially if you consider the price pros excellent sound and comfort cons maybe a little dated looking review by adrian  posted on  an evergreen model overall theres a reason why these have been around since the s  performance sells very small footprint when folded up very convenient to carry a key advantage to these headphones is the fit  the metal headband acts to clamp the phones just right onto the ears although there is a switch to even lesser the clamping which gives optimal bass from such a good earspeaker seal at the  price point they are a good value considering their build quality and sonic performance also koss is the best with a warranty  should they become damaged they will make them good again ive had mine for many years pros great fit good bass clear mid and treble performance cons cushions disintegrate over time review by jerry  posted on  gotta try them overall after

couple headphones like bose and akg i thought i was fully satisfied with these headphones but i wanted something more i looked online and the koss porta pros seemed to have good reviews so i decided to give them a go once i bought them and tried them on i was astonished the fullness of the sound and the clarity of instruments was unbeatable to my standards the porta pros are definitely a bang for the buck and i definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for a more fulfilling listening experience pros the esque design the comfort levels the low price and of course the amazing sound cons from time to time the headband snags my hair review by karol  posted on  porta pro has the best sound overall i bought my first pair about  years ago since that time there have been several headphone manufactures that have developed better sounding headphones but only if you are willing to spend x more these are by far the best sounding headphones for the cost they have this feature where you can adjust the pressure of the earpads on your ears while this feature is not that important to me i can see where this would be of benefit to some the dynamic range of these headphones are wide enough to allow the listener to hear all of the music the dynamic range of the human ear is about hz to khz the range of these headphones is hzkhz more than adequate to cover the audible wavelength and any inaudible harmonics which add richness to sounds pros great sound for price cons none review by mcleanpe  posted on  best headphones ever overall great headphones which work well with all your modern

portability design cons none review by morten  posted on  one of my favorites products overall i bought my first set of porta pros in the late s i kept them until i accidentally shredded the cable when it got caught on my leg while on the stationary bike i was shocked to find that they were still being made i went out and bought  pairs since then i have owned other more expensive cooler headphones but none that have sounded as good or was more comfortable than my porta pros i still use them in the gym  to  times per week so i tend to wear them out every  or so years the great sound and comfortable design make working out way more pleasant thanks for maintaining such a great product for a fair price over such a long time span pros consistancy cons used to be cool review by ed  posted on  one word great overall great sound for that price a little bit bassy and high frequencies are crisp but not at the level of the ksc comfortable enough but mechanical is weaker than other compact headphones i tested anyway a very good choice for mobility pros sound quality cons not so robust as others review by dxdx  posted on  my ears are happy overall i cannot go out with listening to music and ive gone through a lot of onearheadphones that have superb sound quality good build but what has always ticked me off is how they hurt my ears after hours of having them on i just bought these this morning and ive had them on for about  hours now and my ears still feel nothing i absolutely love it good build quality excellent sound excellent feel i am now a fan of koss pros excellent sound quality very compact feels good to wear ears wont hurt even after having them on for hours cons my hair tends to get stuck at the metal band but it rarely happens review by paulo  posted on  great reliable headphons overall ive been buying these since the s and have always found them to sound fantastic and easy to carry around also they truly honor the warranty whenever there has been a problem buy these pros great sound and potability cons like most portable headphones they break at the plug review by charlie mingus  posted on  fantastic sound mechanically weaker overall the porta pros acoustic quality is proverbial for instance anytime when somebody tries to argue with me that you cannot hear any difference between lets say  and kbs mp i use porta pro to easily prove them wrong and to let them experience the real difference in sound quality by themselves before i voice here my concerns about mechanical sturdiness i must say that i do abuse my gear a lot coz i mostly use it when running or travelling my first porta pro i bought in early s they cost me a small fortune and lasted  years even long after all ear cushions and the supportive pads were gone i still used them for the fantastic sound they offered which beats any open and most of closed earphones with unimaginable ease i was pleasantly surprised to see in early s how much the price dropped then i was quite disappointed to see they also don’t last what they had used to the th anniversary black edition lasted less than a year and the replacement too i find the firmness regulation mechanism the weakest point even with the first pair i bought in s this hasn’t changed  that is still the first thing that breaks down in few weeks time and from that moment on the earphones are in firm mode since usually you have shorter time to listen available than the time which it takes before your ears to start hurt i don’t find this as a big problem what i do abhor however is the poor quality of cable which leads to mm jack the s model lasted  years the cable was soft and had rubbery feel the two pcs which i bought a year or two ago had a cable which had a more plastic touch and which also is stiffer both broke in the connection between the jack and the cable and as a result the sound only went into one speaker this happened only after few months of use of course the earphones are very affordable but still if you buy somewhere where the socalled lifetime warranty is applicable do keep the receipt it might come handy sooner than you might expect also what i m going to do w my next pair is to wrap an inch of cable above jack with black duct tape to move tear and wear from the connector part to more flexible part of the cable professionally i have been involved with companies who outsource their production from developed countries elsewhere sometimes locally sourced components do not have such good quality or in order to save a cent or two a marketing decision is made to use very slightly lower quality parts for the notsocritical components i know that s are gone and it will never be back but if you ask me i would more than happily pay  more and get the overall mechanical sturdiness to which i got used to  years ago however all this is rich mens problems like complaining that the seats in new ferrari are slightly less durable than the seats in the older one it is still ferrari  if you have never listened to these earphones try them and you will hear by yourself pros sound especially basses lightweight foldable cons regulation of firmness jack cable review by lucas  posted on  porta pro time machine overall what a throw back i originally picked up a pair in  while in the military i thought they sounded good at that time i had one of the first portable cd players and enjoyed listening i really used this pair to death and i purchased another and then moved on to ear bud headphones so i was online and found these again and said let’s try them out again and see if i still like them i gotta tell you this is one of the best deals on the internet these sound better than any ear bud and most over the ear phones you gotta try them if you don’t like them then just return them in the end you will keep them pros great sound comfortable cons easily broken review by bubba  posted on  koss portpro headphones overall i just purchased a pair of koss porta pro

chain cons other people can hear the sounds coming from the head phones review by brgary  posted on  mindblowing overall ive had these headphones for several years now and my brother owned them for about a year or so before he gave them to me my family is a bit on the audiophile side so ive had many different headphones to compare these tonotably koss dj and sennheiser hd in all honesty i may actually prefer my koss portapros over either pair being someone that tries to achieve the best listening experience on a budget of course i have listened to many many headphones these headphones have always seemed to conquer even the highend  headphones and needless to say they crush every headphone in its price range all of my friends are skeptical of them because of their classic and kind of cheap appearance but their face says it all when i have them put them on its pretty funny watching peoples reactions when they realize that  headphones are miles ahead of their  headphones in terms of sound my only complaint is that they start to make the tops of my ears sore after wearing them for several hours on end however thats to be expected with most headphones their light weight also means theyre kind of flimsy so be careful handling them i would go throwing them in your book bag or letting them fall onto the floor they break very easily however if you care for your headphones as you should they can easily last you an upwards of    years if youre looking for headphones with highend sound but not the highend price these headphones are perfect they sound amazing feel great on your head and your wallet will appreciate the price pros incredible sound quality affordability lightweight cons they tend to become uncomfortable after    hours of constant wear review by brian  posted on

ive tossed them around ive replaced the foam around the ear pads  they dry out like any foam after  years ive had my little girl yank on the cord  and they still work flawlessly best headphones ive ever bought hands down the only thing i can say negative is that the foam pads on the head strap i’m sure thats not what you call it came off after several years but they dont really serve much of a purpose and still fit great without them im sure koss would replace them if i sent them in since they have a lifetime guarantee too they also are a little old school looking as theyre open ear but for some this is actual style points and not a negative all in all there is no way to understand just how rich and clear these things are until you put them on your head ive worn  over the ear professional headphones that dont touch how amazing these things are im constantly putting them on heads of my skeptical friends and watching their eyes light up with amazement when i hit play on my iphone buy a pair you wont be sorry pros rich bass comfortable durability lifetime guarantee cons design looks dated foam pads on head strap fell out after several years of use review by srtelle  posted on  perfect headphones overall i own one pair since five years and i still love the great sound the only con is that the headphones come off when you do not put them in a box for transport and then you cannot tell which is the right and which is the left one i have tested them against some  other headphones like sennheiser and monster but these are to my ears the ones with the most realistic sound you can spend  times more money but don´t get better sound only my inear shure se produces even better sound but is less comfortable and cost  times as much and you cannot compare

of any headset that i have owned including much more expensive fullsized ones the frequency response is excellent up and down but the bass fidelity is superb some other headsets emphasize bass

them and broke them the other day there was no doubt about what i would buy to replace them and after  years they still cost the same price i paid for them back in  thats amazing koss rocks pros everything cons none review by rc  posted on  awesome overall i love them pros everything cons nothing review by midtowon  posted on  porta pro onear overall excellent headphones for the price nice foldup design produces very accurate tones ive had mine since  still working perfectly unfortunately the design and construction is pretty delicate you just have to be careful with it i did lose sound in on ear about  months after i purchased them koss replaced them really quick so far no problems i should have purchased the other model that i think they discontinued that had a noise cancelling device attached to it or was it an amplifier with volume control cant remember it too got good ratings anyway extremely satisfied with these light headphones they produce some incredible bass also love the life time warranty on this phone too with the lifetime warranty options im set for the rest of my life pros sound quality cons delicate construction review by cigarjohn  posted on  the best portable headphones ever overall i have owned koss porta pros for over  years the sound was amazing then and i havent heard any phones that will touch them in all around sound the bass is strong and tight not boomy you can hear every instrument including voices every time i let a friend listen to them they are blown away i own  pairs one each for my spouse and is mp player and one for the computer i use them all the time so i have  spares in case of any breakage i then send them back to koss with  for a new or repaired set they are very durable so that doesnt happen often pros amazing natural sound through the whole sound spectrum cons none review by petro  posted on  best headphones in price range overall these on ear headphones are the best and most comfortable ive listened to for under  the warm deep and detailed tones are fantastic the lightweight design and cushy pads dont cause any strain on my head listening to them is easy and recommended for long periods of time the one thing that keeps them from being a perfect product is the thin cord is easy to tear at the jack the cord is not very durable overall if you have an mp player or listen to music through your phone these are a must have pros very comfortable great sound quality good price cons small cord easy to break review by jetta  posted on  top quality headphones overall i have been a proud owner of this headphone for over  years and still have the same super sound i got the first time i used it base middle tone high tone everything super excellent product price also is ok i can only recommend pros everything best sound comfortable lightweight quality cons none review by franzis  posted on  super sound low price overall i love these headphones and use them every day got mad when the second pair was broken but i got a new cord from koss themselves thank you koss for making best headsets ever love all of them pros comfortable easy to travel with low price and good sound the bass can go really low and of course really good service if you call koss warranty for the rest of my life cons had two of them and both have broken but i got new cord on the second one review by peri  posted on  the one and only overall what can be said about these headphones that has not already been said in the  years they have been in production well my girlfriend thinks they look silly and that for some odd reason makes me love them more out of few phones i currently own i always find myself reaching for these with the wonderful bass and full bodied sound comes the whole porta pro experience  first you try and squeeze them out of the tiny bag that koss has provided  then you unroll unhook and unfold them  next comes the pain of adjusting them on your head as they rip hairs out surprisingly gratifying  the plug that tiny little plug now gets placed into whatever devise you have waiting for them  finally the sound you forget just how wonderful it is almost every time as it hits your ears heaven thank you koss for this gem pros comfort once on warm sound cons hair ripping short cord review by stumpy  posted on  great headphones overall these are great headphones i take them everywhere

sound battery life comfort all great overall my th pair of koss headphones since my first set of pro s in the late s and very pleased with the sound controls battery life and ease of paring have different styles for different purposes and environments and this latest addition was a result of wanting to cut the cord while travelling andor walking  biking setup worked flawlessly battery life is excellent and the sound while not equal to my studio models is better than expected love the onboard controls too bluetooth range and connection stability  quality are also excellent another great product from the folks who invented the stereo phone review by the sound of koss without the wires  posted on  great for the price point overall well first i would like to say that these are a great pair of headphones for the price i tend to listen to a lot of game and movie soundtracks as well as some european metal music and im noticing sounds with these that i didnt hear at all with my logitech gaming headset i forgot the model or my koss uri headset for only  im loving the sound quality that these deliver pros great sound quality well balanced lows mids and highs comfortable on my head and ears for the most part see cons below seems to be a sturdy design cord fits in tightly and doesnt move around in the connector cons the ear pads make me sweat and then they get sticky cord could have been longer final thoughts for the most part i love them i just wish they would have made the ear pads out of something that didnt fit quite so snugly so i wouldnt sweat against them the cord could have been longer however no matter whether i have them wired or connected via bluetooth they sound amazing for the price i highly recommend these to anybody else looking for a great pair of high quality budget headphones review by dweb  posted on  great product sounds good overall this product is great i only wish their customer service email department was as good as these headphones because unlike the headphones they lack proper response time and professional responses  review by tp  posted on  excellent sound excellent battery smart design overall i have owned these headphones pretty much since they launched late last year although the cost may seem a bit hefty the value of these headphones are worth far more than the retail value firstly these are the only bluetooth stereo headphones ive found that can last more than  hours on a single charge to make matters better is they are extremely lightweight im almost certain that its not possible for a battery to exist in the device but sure enough it works also charging through a standard  amp  volt charger takes about  hour also the sound is absolutely amazing if you own or heard a pair of prodj or prodj of which i own both then youll know what these sound like pretty much identical to clean crisp sound they provide another plus since it has its own power source through bluetooth no need to carry around an amp for your mobile device they are plenty loud i also fell in love with the design of the device no only is it just as comfortable as the prodj the buttons for the bluetooth controls are placed very well theyre easy to find and the added textures to them make it easy to identify as well also the idea to have a line in for the headphones is great too it will always work even when the battery is dead now the bluetooth is excellent but it does have its quirks interference is common when moving around in these i go through a lot of public transportation and ive gotten used to the few hiccups every now and then however minor interruptions are exactly that minor bluetooth always reconnects seamlessly and the music keeps on playing nfc is a nice touch for devices that support it great way to connect and disconnect your bluetooth without have to change any settings also if you have a device with the aptx codec get them quality loss on these while playing lossless flac is near to none i dont hear any distortion when i use a supported device and if there is some distortion it probably isnt audible to begin with the regular bluetooth compression isnt very bad either mps being the most unaffected due to the bandwidth being similar however the convenience of having the bluetooth feature outweighs the negatives mainly because call clarity is excellent not only can the person on the other end hear me well i can hear them with no problems at all now if youre looking to see what version of bluetooth these use my best guess would be  however there isnt a great way to test that so its pretty much on koss to give that information for obvious reasons these also have a  year warranty it sucks but its understandable bluetooth technology changes periodically and batteries dont last forever depending on the type of battery used in these these headphones can probably have a life of  years before the battery becomes useless now if only they designed the line in to be on the left ear cup and not on the right all in all these are probably the best headphones to get on the bluetooth market within this price range theyre solidly built and definitely worth having pros battery life sound design cons bluetooth interference warranty review by j lopez  posted on  write your own review youre reviewing bti how do you rate this product     star  stars  stars  stars  stars overall
