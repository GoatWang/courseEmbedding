longshort equity hedge fund strategy over which the manager has full discretion this hedge fund strategy strives to grow and protect client capital through an activelymanaged prudentlydiversified longbiased longshort equity portfolio comprised of liquid large and midcap global equities the manager follows a multidisciplinary valuebased investment process with risk controls the strategy blends topdown macroeconomic analysis with bottomup fundamental valuation the investment team’s macroeconomic analysis includes the valuation of currencies commodities industries and markets in order to develop global macroeconomic investment themes that are expressed in the strategy through long and short equity positions the manager may trade and invest in individual equities as well as exchangetraded funds and related options the strategy employs a moderate amount of leverage within constraints based on the investment team’s assessment of market risks and opportunities the strategy’s bottomup approach to equity valuation starts with a proprietary fundamental quantitative model that was originally built in  by the firm’s chief investment officer kevin c smith cfa the model applies an innovative and robust discountedfreecashflow methodology to produce daily valuations of the top  largest and mostliquid global equities that trade on a us exchange the fundamental
