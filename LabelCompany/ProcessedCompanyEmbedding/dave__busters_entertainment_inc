this significant investments in rd should be made in order to develop new gaming technology these new games should be advertised and marketed heavily this will boost revenues for the entire industry in addition sales in the industry are strongly correlated to the economy dave  buster’s recorded a loss in  and  due to the economy to address this the company should diversify its product base by offering promotions on games this would allow them to attract customers and boost food and alcohol revenues which offer the highest operating margins  management cognitive inertia ● framing lockin ○ no evidence of changes in philosophy or strategy ○ likely due to long tenures of ceo and cfo  years key employee kevin bachus ● worked for  companies in the gaming and tech industries ● position is critical because gaming sets db’s apart from competitors employee characteristics ● all five top managers were outside hires from a wide variety of companies and industries ● ceo and cfo have been in their positions since  creating the potential for inertia management action inertia ● leadership failures  status quo ○ no changes to the business model or establishments ○ focus is on continued expansion ○ overcoming inertia means radically changing the business  key employee kevin bachus kevin bachus is the senior vp of entertainment and gaming strategy his position is particularly critical because gaming and entertainment is what sets db’s apart from direct competitors and alternative industries bachus comes with significant experience as he has worked for  companies in the gaming and technology industry since  this experience will be critical as dave  buster’s will need to come up with new and innovative methods of entertainment to keep sales high in a slowing and cyclical industry employee characteristics although dave  buster’s was established in  the company has managed to keep things fresh by constantly hiring new employees to the organization from a variety of other companies and industries kevin bachus was hired on from bebo inc stephen king who is the current ceo was hired from carlson restaurants worldwide which is the parent company of tgi fridays dolf berle who is the coo was hired from business and sports club of clubcorp brian jenkins the cfo since  was hired from six flags amusement parks john melleady the sr vp of real estate and development was hired from bj’s wholesale club with the exception of brian jenkins and stephen king the company has a relatively new management staff this reduces the amount of inertia and biases that will occur review on glassdoorcom generally spoke positively of the culture at dave  buster’s cognitive inertia framing lockins dave and buster’s experienced cognitive inertia in the form of framing lockins the company’s ceo stephen king and their cfo brian jenkins have been around the industry since  there is no evidence that the company has adapted to new philosophies strategies or cultures during this time period dave  buster’s continues to operate as they have in the past without consideration of new product lines or gaming ideas the framing lockin inertia has contributed to the slow growth of the company and industry action inertia leadership failures status quo despite the industry growth steadily slowing dave  buster’s has not made any significant changes to their strategy the company still follows the same “eat drink play” motto and has the same fundamental setup at their locations rather than focusing on opening new locations dave  buster’s should look for blue ocean opportunities and look for new opportunities outside of their immediate customer base and industry  industry description ● provides alcohol casual dining and gaming without gambling ● niche market with small players

operates with annual revenues of mm this company has differentiated itself from competitors by also offering bowling ● gameworks offers foods alcohol and gaming to customers while they are a competitor to db’s the two companies rarely overlap geographically in addition gameworks lacks the economies of scale and brand image of dbs ● dave  buster’s is by far the largest player in the industry with mm in revenues they are highly focused on marketing advertising and promotions five forces description substitutes high impact ● many substitutes readily available to consumers including  bars and nightclubs  movie theaters and  casinos ● high differentiation branding and promotions reduces likelihood of switching from db to a competitor ● home gaming consoles competitive rivalry high impact ● high differentiation low growth low fixed costs and low exit barriers increase the threat of competitive rivalry ● although db dominates the industry with  of the market there is strong rivalry with independently owned businesses ● the differentiation of the industry can be seen through db’s patented arcade games strong branding efforts and advertising campaigns bargaining power of buyers moderate impact ● buyers are consumers typically ages  little or no switching costs to competitors or substitute products ● db is differentiated has patented arcade games and strategically located which reduces the bargaining power of buyers new market entrants low impact ● high differentiation high rivalry and low growth means that the threat of new market entrants is weak ● the combination of db’s high market share and low industry growth make the industry unappealing to potential entrants ● small independent establishments capture remaining revenues bargaining power of suppliers low impact ● there are a large number of alcohol and food suppliers in the us ● dave  buster’s is a relatively large account m per year in sales this makes them important to suppliersappendix  assumptions used for industry calculations  blue ocean paths industry life cycle graph was originally from ibis and modified for this presentation complementary services ● transportation service ● follow uber business model ● low overhead low entry barriers ● increases willingness to pay for regular customers functional vs emotional appeal ● new marketing campaign to promote family entertainment ● offer promotional deals on birthday parties ● support promotions with advertising campaign that targets families ● industry is in decline ● growth is slower than the economy  industry life cycle forecasted industry growth is less than the national average at  this indicates that this industry is slowly dying game manufacturers are declining making it more difficult to find new machines the game console has provided a new segment in the market shrinking the arcade game opportunity and interest strong correlation to the economy when the economy is high consumer spending follows when the economy is declining entertainment is one of the first sectors that consumers cut on spending this can cause a steep decline for the industry and many businesses are unable to survive high competition from other gaming sources such as internet  home consoles this industry continues to grow allowing potential customers to play games and entertain at home blue ocean look across complementary products and services dave and buster’s is putting out transportation services for customer’s convenience dave and buster’s will transport its members who live within  miles away from each location by its new shuttle services by doing this service db’s will attract more customers to have membership with db’s and db’s will have more chance to serve its customers more efficiently look across functional vs emotional appeal instead of focusing exclusively on the idea that db’s holds alcohol at the center of its business the company can target a completely new environment that customers will enjoy at the restaurant by aiming for a more family oriented atmosphere db’s can offer special packages for birthday parties or anniversaries that customers only can find at db’s besides good deals on food and beverages customers will now have a chance to win surprising gifts for their birthday parties to make it more remarkable  competitive position dave and buster’s founded  strategic position differentiation ● st mover differentiator ● niche market strategy ● offer great atmosphere with variety of foods beverages and games ● loyal customer program ●  locations including canada main competitor lucky strike founded  strategic position differentiation ● late mover ● full service bars ● various food types ● games bowling and other entertainment ●  locations in the us  differentiation db is a first move differentiation as they were one of the first to bring gaming to adults previously entertainment venues similar to db were aimed at children db enticed the adult experience by introducing alcoholic beverages dave and buster’s is following its principle to provide to the customers an upbeat atmosphere while staying at its location by providing high quality foods signature drinks based on location and latest hightech games db’s foods and beverages are updated three times a year to refresh the menus and its customer taste the foods and alcoholic beverages account for almost  of the total revenue and the remaining are on games the loyal customer program is striving to maintain the relationship with its customers and level up its customer satisfaction by sending out promotions and weekly updated news customers at db’s are encouraged to enter “winner’ s circle” to have chances to win the prizes of high tech gifts and other interesting rewards lucky strike lucky strike headquarter is in sherman oaks ca lucky strike main focus is on bowling operations and other participated activities with dinein option they also have full bar service which provides different varieties of beverages and spirits why lucky strike is db’s main competitor lucky strike has a urban appeal that targets db’s similar age group of  the hip appeal tends to attract large groups for entertainment such as db both companies have a similar price structure lucky strike has  locations around the united states and is seen as the strongest competitors of dave and buster’s  swot vrio analysis strength ● size advantage over other players ● marketing and customer research ● branding ● differentiated customer experience ● strategic locations ● diversified management team weaknesses ● sales depend on the economy ● slow growth industry due to technology competition ● differentiated but idle for several years opportunities ● expanding to international markets ● vertical expansion ● partnership is offered by various famous suppliers threats ● economic downturn ● potential new entrants ● substitutes and alternatives ●

imitability organization ● corporate owned ● high capital ● menu that accommodates health needs ● high focus on human power preparing food and serving ● “eat drink and play” has been successful but needs to adapt to new trends and technologies ● patented games not given to competitors ● new locations are strategically placed ● “eat drink and play” all under one roof is unique ● low barriers to entry means that new market entrants can easily enter industry ● growing faster than industry average ● success in industry is highly dependent on a “fun” brand image which is hard to establish ● several recent top management hires that will help direct the company in a new direction ● rotating menu based on marketing research and customer needs ● used size advantage to purchase nine jillian’s locations when the company went bankrupt ● using size and brand reputation to investigate expansion into new markets  swot analysis vrio analysis strength dave  buster’s is highly differentiated through their unique entertainment systems it is also famous for delivering promotions to its members via emails and the variety of promotion is very unique this narrows the scope of the industry and has resulted in no competition on a national level weaknesses the entertainment provided is considered a luxury which gives it a strong correlation to the macroeconomy sales will therefore be highly dependent on household income levels opportunities dave and buster’s has been offered to be partner with so many suppliers due to its popularity dave  buster’s only has one international location in canada further locations can be opened in canada as well as other economically stable countries in addition opportunities exist to expand vertically this includes activities such as liquor production and cab services threats as mentioned above sales are dependent on household income which makes the macroeconomy a threat in addition low barriers to entry make new entrants a constant threat to marketshare lastly there are a large number of substitute and alternative products such as standard sports bars movie theaters and sporting events → db company position is an industry differentiator by using their branded games and company branding value dave  buster’s has industry knowledge that far exceeds its competitors db has corporate executives and administration that have worked in the field for many years and are able to provide valuable insight to make strategic decisions to develop db be the company it is today this knowledge allows them to expand and remain at the forefront in the industry rareness the accessibility of the resources of db are rare as they are able to utilize corporate knowledge to find the best locations and newly available games corporate headquarters has analysts and operations that are continually making connections and ideas to provide uniqueness to the brand and products offered imitability imitation is feasible in this industry and has been copied many times but competitors have not found continued success for long the capital costs involved in opening a entertainment facility are high which limits the number of new entrants organization db offers high variety with menu options and quality of product by utilizing staff members to make the best product for the customer the management team is composed of new hires from a variety of industries which brings a variety of new ideas and processes to the company  company comparison db vs lucky strike in order from most important to least important to the customerappendix  relative cost assumptions ● brand image and promotions are the most critical wtp elements to customers ● dave  buster’s successfully achieved this by spending additional costs on marketing advertising and promotional expenses ● the slight increase in expenditures caused significant gains in willingness to pay  relative costs and willingness to pay relative cost analysis relative costs for dave  buster’s and lucky strike were allocated based on the average amount a customer spends per visit which is approximately  ● marketing and advertising the most impactful difference in relative costs can be seen in marketing advertising and promotional expenses in which db’s costs were estimated to be  more expensive than lucky strike db has invested heavily in this area as reflected in the increases in willingness to pay due to brand image and promotions ● economies of scale dave  buster’s economies of scale were estimated to produce favorable relative costs for payroll general and administrative expenses of  and  respectively ● bowling lanes because the bowling lanes at lucky strike are more expensive and require additional maintenance the cost of amusement and depreciation were each estimated to be  more expensive than dave  buster’s ● company growth dave  buster’s is growing significantly faster than lucky strike so the company as a whole incurs more preopening costs per customer this additional expense was estimated to be  willingness to pay ● price average price per customer for both db and lucky strike is equalthe allocation of the amount spent changes more is spent on entertainment whereas a larger portion is spent on drinks at lucky strike the experience of food drink and play is rated equal but slightly varies on preferences ● brand image db spends a larger amount on advertising which gives them more of a prominent image in the casual dining and gaming industry ● promotions db is intricately involved in target promotions through website email and loyalty program high marketing knowledge helps to target the consumers needs and increase profits ● location db utilizes their corporation headquarters analysis to find the best locations for their potential customers they also have a larger amount of stores ranging about  locations compared to lucky strike  stores held currently ● variety of games lucky strikes variety of games is higher as they offer both bowling and arcade games db has a large offering of games but is not as well diversified ● quality of food db changes the menu three times a year and they invest in research development highly trained chefs to differentiate their product from competitors lucky strikes menu remains consistent  game theory ● problem customers are not returning enough which decreases revenues and creates inconsistent cash flows ● players dave  buster’s and lucky strike ● information promotion will not be announced until it has started all other information is public ● actions offer members  free gaming each month maintain rewards or abandon loyalty program altogether ● decision dominant strategy for both db and lucky strike to increase promotions ● sensitivity ○ customers do not spend additional money on food and drinks resulting in a loss ○ other competitors enter the game and the rewards do not entice customers making the changes ineffective appendix a  game model appendix b  payoffs appendix c  formulas and sensitivity appendix d  key assumptions  detail of game theory problem dave  buster’s has limited customer loyalty to address this the company has the option to increase the current rewards offered in their loyalty program the proposed increases would offer members of the program  of gaming for free each month this would increase customer retention and profits through increased food and beverage sales players dave  buster’s and their main competitor lucky strike information dave  buster’s will not release any information about the change in rewards until the program is launched this would prevent lucky strike from strategizing beforehand and create a sequential timing scenario actions dave  buster’s has the option to increase the rewards offered through the loyalty program or maintain the rewards as they currently are in response lucky strike can increase maintain or abandon the rewards offered in their loyalty program decisions both companies have a dominant strategy to increase rewards through the promotion sensitivity analysis ● if the customers do not respond as strongly to the promotions as expected then the decisions will become less profitable and lucky strike may choose not to increase rewards regardless of dave  buster’s decision ● if other competitors enter the game then loyalty will not be increased to the extent that was excepted this would change lucky strike’s decision to increase rewards with dave  buster’s  corporate strategy betteroff test betteroff test ● vertical integration ○ move upstream and create exclusive relationships liquor manufacturers ● relationship specific investments ○ alcohol metabolizes quickly so customers can driver sooner ○ flavors are tailored to db’s specialty cocktails ● downstream freeriding ○ possibility of manufacturers selling new liquor formulas to retail stores and competitors ● future horizontal integration ○ can sell db’s branded liquor to retail locations appendix  complete value chain map  details of betteroff test ● relationship specific investments the alcohol produced will have two unique characteristics that will be tailored to the needs of db’s customers ○ the flavor of the alcohol will be formulated to enhance the flavor of specialty drinks offered only at db’s ○ the alcohol will quickly metabolize allowing customers to drive home safely without having to use transportation services on average  million people are arrested for driving under the influence each year ● downstream freeriding the formulation of specialty flavors and invention of alcohol that dissipates quickly in the bloodstream will require large investments in rd and marketing because of this liquor producers are currently reluctant to make these investments because competitors will be able to freeride on their research this decreases db’s research as industry revenues would increase with these innovations by vertically integrating db’s can make the investments and solve the freerider problem ● horizontal integration once db’s branded alcohol becomes established then the company may decide to integrate horizontally into the retail market this would include selling to supermarkets liquor stores and basic sports bars  corporate strategy ownership test ownership test ● vertical integration ○ move upstream and own liquor production facilities ● relationship specific investments ○ ownership allows production schedule to be aligned with db’s needs set forth by marketing ● downstream freeriding ○ difficult to create bulletproof contracts so ownership of the facilities is a safer option ● future horizontal integration ○ ownership of facilities will allow db’s to capture larger margins on sales to retail outlets appendix  complete value chain map  details of ownership test ● relationship specific investments by owning their own liquor production facilities db’s can ensure that production is consistent with their needs this means that if capacity is expected to reach  then db’s establishments will have priority in receiving the alcohol furthermore production can be aligned with the needs set forth by the marketing department if db’s plans to offer a discount on a certain type of liquor then they will be able to increase production ahead of time ● downstream freeriding one major concern with db’s financing the research into creating this alcohol is the possibility of downstream freeriding by owning the liquor production facilities db’s would ensure that the recipes technology and suppliers used to create the alcohol remained a secret ● horizontal integration if db’s decides to integrate horizontally then then owning the alcohol facilities will increase their margins on sales at supermarkets liquor stores and basic sports bars in  retail sales of alcoholic beverages was  billion dave  buster’s competitive advantage will enable them to capture a portion of that revenue  ● primary synergy ○ vertical integration ● secondary synergies ○ coordinated strategies ○ shared knowhow ○ shared tangible resources ● recommendation ○ upstream integration ○ own liquor production facility synergy from vertical integration  details of vertical synergy ● primary synergy ○ vertical integration by owning their own liquor production facilities dave  buster’ s will be able to reduce the time it takes to develop new varieties of alcohol reduce inventory costs by timing production and increase utilization ● secondary synergies ○ coordinated strategies dave  buster’s establishments will be able to align their strategies with the liquor production facilities first the alcohol produced will be tailored specifically to the wants and needs of db’s customers second the production facilities will be able to schedule production of certain types of alcohol and certain seasons this can be aligned with the cyclical demand at the db’s establishments ○ shared knowhow marketing research into the needs of customers will be shared by both the establishments as well as the production facilities ○ shared tangible resources there are two main resources that will be shared first the db’s brand will be used at both locations second all corporate overhead will be shared ● recommendation ○ based on the above synergies the results of the betteroff and ownership tests and the large potential increases in revenue it is recommended that db’s vertically integrate by owning a liquor production facility  appendix   industry assumptions because of the uniqueness of dave  buster’s industry the following assumptions were used to estimate total revenues and growth ● the industry will echo the “arcade food and entertainment complexes” industry ● in that industry the top four companies make up  of the total revenue ● of that  companies that fall into the more focused industry make up  ● we assume this ratio for the entire industry which means that  of the companies in “arcade food and entertainment complexes would also fall into the more focused industry ● in addition an estimated  of the  billion bowling industry would also fall into the more focused industry ● this brings the total forecasted revenues for the more focused industry to  billion growth is assumed to be the same as the “arcade food and entertainment complexes” industry  appendix   industry forces substitutes high impact ● many substitutes readily available to consumers including  bars and nightclubs  movie theaters and  casinos ● high differentiation branding and promotions reduces likelihood of switching from db to a competitor competitive rivalry high impact ● high differentiation low growth low fixed costs and low exit barriers increase the threat of competitive rivalry ● although db dominates the industry with  of the market there is strong rivalry with independently owned businesses ● the differentiation of the industry can be seen through db’s patented arcade games strong branding efforts and advertising campaigns bargaining power of buyers moderate impact ● buyers are consumers typically ages  little or no switching costs to competitors or substitute products ● db is differentiated has patented arcade games and strategically located which reduces the bargaining power of buyers new market entrants low impact ● high differentiation high rivalry and low growth means that the threat of new market entrants is weak ● the combination of db’s high market share and low industry growth make the industry unappealing to potential entrants ● small independent establishments capture remaining revenues bargaining power of suppliers low impact ● there are a large number of alcohol and food suppliers in the us ● dave  buster’s is a relatively large account m per year in sales this makes them important to suppliers  appendix   intra firm value chain  appendix   cost assumptions ● assumption  lucky strike cost of food and beverages are  less expensive due to use of cheaper ingredients and less variety ● assumption  lucky strike cost of amusement is  more expensive due to additional expenses from bowling alleys ● assumption  lucky strike operating and payroll benefits are  more expensive due to less economies of scale ● assumption  lucky strike general and administrative expenses are  higher due to less economies of scale ● assumption  lucky strike marketing advertising and promotional expenses are  lower due to less advertising and marketing efforts ● assumption  lucky strike depreciation and amortization expenses are  higher due to bowling alleys ● assumption  lucky strike preopening costs are  lower due to slower growth rate  appendix a  game model  appendix b  game payoffs payoffs ● db increases rewards lucky strike increases rewards m  m ● db increases rewards lucky strike maintains rewards m m ● db increases rewards lucky strike abandons rewards m  m ● db maintains rewards lucky strike increases rewards m m ● db maintains rewards lucky strike maintains rewards   ● db maintains rewards lucky strike abandons rewards m m  appendix c  game assumptions ● there are no incremental costs from the increase in gameplay all equipment has already been purchased and is therefore a sunk cost ● lucky strike is geographically relevant this means that the game only applies to db locations that are close to a lucky strike facility ● there are no other direct competitors nearby that could influence the game ● dave  buster’s and lucky strike have the same operating margin ● food and beverages account  of revenue at lucky strike this is  less than dave  buster’s and is due to lucky strikes additional revenues from bowling ● lucky strike’s gross margin on food and beverage sales is  lower than dave  buster’s due to weaker economies of scale that result in lower bargaining power with suppliers ● all incremental revenues from the promotions will come from additional food and beverage sales no additional games will be played by the customers  appendix d  game formulas dave  buster’s ● operating income of  mm averaging  per store ● an estimated  in revenues from gaming will be lost per store due to the increases in rewards ● food and beverage sales account for  of revenues and have a profit margin of  which averages to  operating income per store ● the increased benefits will increase food and beverage sales by  which will generate an additional  operating income per store less the cost of the rewards ● if lucky strike also increases rewards from loyalty program then food and beverage sales will increase by  or  operating income less the cost of the rewards ● if only lucky strike increases rewards then food and beverage sales will decrease by  or  operating income ● if lucky strike abandons rewards than food and beverage sales will increase by  which will generate an additional  operating income per store less the cost of rewards ● if db increases and lucky strike abandons rewards operating income will increase by  ● if db maintains and lucky strike abandons rewards operating income will increase by  lucky strike ● operating income of  mm which is an average of  per store ● an estimated  in revenues from gaming will be lost per store due to the increases in rewards ● food and beverage sales account for  of revenues and have a gross margin of  which averages to  operating income per store ● the increased rewards will increase food and beverage sales by  which will generate an additional  operating income per store less the cost of the rewards ● if db also increases rewards then food and beverage sales will increase by  or  operating income less the cost of the rewards ● if only db increases rewards then food and beverage sales will decrease by  or  operating income less the cost of
