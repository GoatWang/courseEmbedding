in small and midcapitalization companies involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger capitalization companies investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods the nuance concentrated value fund and nuance concentrated value longshort fund are nondiversified meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund therefore the fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund short sale of securities involves unlimited risk including the possibility that losses may exceed the original amount invested however a mutual fund investor’s risk is limited to one’s amount of investment in a mutual fund
