of december   vanguard is clientowned as a client owner you own the funds that own vanguard vanguard provides services to the vanguard funds and etfs at cost reference content layer openedread the transcript liz tammaro so we received quite a few questions in advance when you all registered for this webcast were going to get started with our first question and jim im going to give this one to you so it makes a lot of sense before we get started lets define what is an etf jim rowley simply put an etf is an exchangetraded fund right− its a pooled investment vehicle that acquires or disposes of securities investors own a pro rata share of the assets in that fund the fund issues new shares or redeems existing shares to meet investor demand furthermore and i should say providing some type of an investment exposure to those advisors whether its an index in particular or a market strategy and when you think about even more so what makes them similar to mutual funds is that the majority of etfs are organized and regulated as investment companies under the investment company act of  and thats the same regulatory regime under which mutual funds operate so for all the discussions sometimes we hear about differences between mutual funds and etfs theyre overwhelmingly similar actually liz tammaro and even thinking about that we can talk about maybe what are some of the benefits of the mutual fund versus an etf or sorry even vice versa etf versus mutual fund and even maybe what are some of the disadvantages jim rowley ill take that because i think i dont necessarily like the word disadvantage i think differences is maybe the more appropriate term and we just addressed some of the similarities between etfs and mutual funds so its maybe more important to know what are the actual differences and really the differences come down to two major items and they both relate to how investors transact in shares of those funds right− were talking about exchangetraded funds etf investors they trade with each other on exchange in terms of buying or selling their securities and the price that they get is a tradeable market price mutual fund investors on the other hand they are buying and selling their shares directly with the fund and they might do that through some type of intermediary but its back and forth with the fund itself and they get an endofday nav so we think about all the similarities and again sometimes theres a discussion about how different they are but really the differences come down to those two items its trading on exchange versus direct with the fund and its trading at a market price rather than getting the endofday nav jim rowley i think we actually have a great way to illustrate that i think we have a chart that addresses that point that doug was talking about that etfs are overwhelming they just happen to be index funds and when the chart comes up a simple way to illustrate this is we look at expense ratios but instead of breaking them down by etf versus mutual fund we break them down by index fund versus nonindex fund separated into etf and mutual fund and when you see the expense ratios you see that given an indexing strategy whether its a mutual fund or an etf the expense ratios tend to be lower than they are for the nonindex strategies whether its an etf or a mutual fund so it has a lot more to do with whether or not its an indexing strategy than whether or not its an etf or a mutual fund liz tammaro and similar to that question we have another one thats come in from bruce asking about how easy is it to buy andor sell an etf versus a mutual fund− jim rowley a lot of moving parts in that question because i think the default has always been mutual funds because theyve been around longer so it becomes a lot of a comfort decision in many ways where purchasing a mutual fund is usually done in dollars you put your orders in in dollar terms youre happy to hit the enter button on your keyboard because you know at the end of the day your order is going to execute at the end of the day with a  pm nav you might be able to get fractional shares because your order gets rounded up into dollars and the mutual fund takes care of the automatic reinvestment for you with an etf investors need to be aware of transacting through their brokerage account and now the dynamic might be a little bit different because you have to put your order in in shares mutually speaking theres no fractionals there when you put your order in shares you get a corresponding dollar amount rather than put the order in dollars and you get a corresponding share amount so you know the ease comes with a comfort level that a particular individual might choose or have a preference for doing important information all investing is subject

vanguardcom or call  to obtain a prospectus investment objectives risks charges expenses or other important information are contained in the prospectus read and consider it carefully before investing

actively managed mutual fund uk economic outlook brexit looms large brokerage trades will soon settle in just  days down from  vacations barbeques lazy summer days—and giving to charity research our firm with finras brokercheck reference content layer openedread the transcript liz tammaro so we received quite a few questions in advance when you all registered for this webcast were going to get started with our first question and jim im going to give this one to you so it makes a lot of sense before we get started lets define what is an etf jim rowley simply put an etf is an exchangetraded fund right− its a pooled investment vehicle that acquires or disposes of securities investors own a pro rata share of the assets in that fund the fund issues new shares or redeems existing shares to meet investor demand furthermore and i should say providing some type of an investment exposure to those advisors whether its an index in particular or a market strategy and when you think about even more so what makes them similar to mutual funds is that the majority of etfs are organized and regulated as investment companies under the investment company act of  and thats the same regulatory regime under which mutual funds operate so for all the discussions sometimes we hear about differences between mutual funds and etfs theyre overwhelmingly similar actually liz tammaro and even thinking about that we can talk about maybe what are some of the benefits of the mutual fund versus an etf or sorry even vice versa etf versus mutual fund and even maybe what are some of the disadvantages jim rowley ill take that because i think i dont necessarily like the word disadvantage i think differences is maybe the more appropriate term and we just addressed some of the similarities between etfs and mutual funds so its maybe more important to know what are the actual differences and really the differences come down to two major items and they both relate to how investors transact in shares of those funds right− were talking about exchangetraded funds etf investors they trade with each other on exchange in terms of buying or selling their securities and the price that they get is a tradeable market price mutual fund investors on the other hand they are buying and selling their shares directly with the fund and they might do that through some type of intermediary but its back and forth with the fund itself and they get an endofday nav so we think about all the similarities and again sometimes theres a discussion about how different they are but really the differences come down to those two items its trading on exchange versus direct with the fund and its trading at a market price rather than getting the endofday nav jim rowley i think we actually have a great way to illustrate that i think we have a chart that addresses that point that doug was talking about that etfs are overwhelming they just happen to be index funds and when the chart comes up a simple way to illustrate this is we look at expense ratios but instead of breaking them down by etf versus mutual fund we break them down by index fund versus nonindex fund separated into etf and mutual fund and when you see the expense ratios you see that given an indexing strategy whether its a mutual fund or an etf the expense ratios tend to be lower than they are for the nonindex strategies whether its an etf or a mutual fund so it has a lot more to do with whether or not its an indexing strategy than whether or not its an etf or a mutual fund liz tammaro and similar to that question we have another one thats come in from bruce asking about how easy is it to buy andor sell an etf versus a mutual fund− jim rowley a lot of moving parts in that question because i think the default has always been mutual funds because theyve been around longer so it becomes a lot of a comfort decision in many ways where purchasing a mutual fund is usually done in dollars you put your orders in in dollar terms youre happy to hit the enter button on your keyboard because you know at the end of the day your order is going to execute at the end of the day with a  pm nav you might be able to get fractional shares because your order gets rounded up into dollars and the mutual fund takes care of the automatic reinvestment for you with an etf investors need to be aware of transacting through their brokerage account and now the dynamic might be a little bit different because you have to put your order in in shares mutually speaking theres no fractionals there when you put your order in shares you get a corresponding dollar amount rather than put the order in dollars and you get a corresponding share amount so you know the ease comes with a comfort level that a particular individual might choose or have a preference for doing important information all investing is subject to risk including the possible loss of the money you invest diversification does not
