mechanics in distance runners during reduced body weight conditionshttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoran context treadmills that unload runners via a differential air pressure bladder dap eg alterg antigravity treadmill are commonly used to reduce effective body weight in a clinical setting however the relationship between the level of unloading and tibial stress is currently unknown objective to determine the relationship between tibial impact acceleration and level of body weight bw unloading during running design crosssectional setting university motionanalysis laboratory participants  distance runners m f  ±  years  ±  kg interventions none main outcome measures peak tibial acceleration and peaktopeak tibial acceleration was measured via a uniaxial accelerometer attached to the tibia during a min continuous treadmill run that simulated reduced bw conditions via a dap bladder the trial began with a min run at  bw followed by nine min stages where bw was systematically reduced from  to  in  increments results there was no significant relationship between level of bw and either peak tibial acceleration or peaktopeak tibial acceleration p both heart rate and step rate were significantly reduced with each  reduction in bw level p conclusions although ground reaction forces are reduced when running in reduced bw conditions on a dap treadmill tibial shock magnitudes are unchanged as an alteration in spatiotemporal running mechanics eg reduced step rate may nullify the unloading effect httpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranarticles peerreviewedtwolegged hopping in autism spectrum disordershttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoransensory processing deficits are common within autism spectrum disorders asd deficits have a heterogeneous dispersion across the spectrum and multimodal processing tasks are thought to magnify integration difficulties twolegged hopping in place in sync with an auditory cue   hz was studied in a group of six individuals with expressive language impaired asd eliasd and an agematched control group vertical ground reaction force data were collected and discrete fourier transforms were utilized to determine dominant hopping cadence effective leg stiffness was computed through a massspring model representation the eliasd group were unsuccessful in matching their hopping cadence  ±  hops·s−  ±  hops·s− to either auditory cue with greater deviations at the  hz cue in contrast the control group was able to match hopping cadence  ±  hops·s−  ±  hops·s− to either cue via an adjustment of effective leg stiffness the eliasd group demonstrated a varied response with an interquartile range iqr in excess of  hops·s− as compared to the control group with an iqr   hops·s− several sensorimotor mechanisms could explain the inability of participants with eliasd to modulate motor output to match an external auditory cue these results suggest that a multimodal gross motor task can  discriminate performance among a group of individuals with severe autism and  could be a useful quantitative tool for evaluating motor performance in individuals with asd individualshttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranarticles peerreviewedhttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranhttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranarticles peerreviewedimpact of direction of unloading influence on template rate of perceived exertionhttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranit is suggested that exercisers engage in a process of teleoanticipation and create an exercise template based upon previous experience with the exercise task which guides their perceptions of the amount of effort required for task completion the present study examined how altering workload intensity during a positivepressure treadmill task may impact ratings of perceived exertion rpe in a counterbalanced design  collegiate cross country runners  males  females performed two min runs at a constant velocity while bodyweight bw was either increased from  to  inc or decreased from  to  dec in  min increments oxygen consumption vo heart rate hr and respiratory exchange ratio rer were collected rpe was recorded at the end of each stage and energy expenditure ee was calculated with vo and rer data there were no significant differences between direction of loading conditions for vo ee hr and rer p   betweentrial differences in rpe at    bw were statistically significant p   with higher rpes observed during the inc trial differences in rpe observed between conditions cannot be explained by physiological mechanisms these findings suggest that rpe is a multifaceted construct which can be impacted by subjectively based anticipatory factors such as exercise intensityhttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranarticles peerreviewedgait analysis of teenagers and young adults diagnosed with autism  severe verbal communication disordershttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranboth movement differences and disorders are common within autism spectrum disorders asd these differences have wide and heterogeneous variability among different ages and subgroups all diagnosed with asd gait was studied in a more homogeneously identified group of nine teenagers and young adults who scored as “severe” in both measures of verbal communication and overall rating of autism on the childhood autism rating scales cars the asd individuals were compared to a group of typically developing university undergraduates of similar ages all participants walked a distance of meters across a gaitrite gr electronic walkway for six trials the asd and comparison groups differed widely on many spatiotemporal aspects of gait including step and stride length foot positioning cadence velocity step time gait cycle time swing time stance time and single and double support time moreover the two groups differed in the percentage of the total gait cycle in each of these phases the qualitative rating of “body use” on the cars also indicated severe levels of unusual body movement for all of the asd participants these findings demonstrate that older teens and young adults with “severe” forms of verbal communication impairments and autism differ widely in their gait from typically developing individuals the differences found in the current investigation are far more pronounced compared to previous findings with younger andor less severely involved individuals diagnosed with asd as compared to typically developing controls as such these data may be a useful anchorpoint in understanding the trajectory of development of gait specifically and motor functions generally httpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranarticles peerreviewedinfluence of midsole ‘actuator lugs’ on running economy in trained distance runnershttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranintroduction previous investigations reported the influence of running shoe design on running economy re and determined that both shoe weight and midsole properties hardness stiffness comfort can alter re external forefoot actuator lugs have been reported to provide enhanced energy return during shoe mechanical testing but it was unclear if this design feature would provide any improvement of re the current investigation measured the effects of external forefoot actuator lugs on re in  highlytrained male distance runners during four submaximal running velocities methods all runners voluntarily completed a maximal graded exercise treadmill protocol followed – days later by eight randomised  min submaximal levelgrade treadmill runs with two randomised footwear conditions wl  with lugs wol  without lugs oxygen consumption heart rate hr rating of perceived effort rpe and sagittal plane highspeed video were collected re metres run per millilitre o per kg of body mass stance duration st stride rate sr and foot strike fs were computed for each trial data were analysed with factorial repeatedmeasures analysis of variance anova results re averaged over all submaximal velocities was significantly greater p   in the wl condition  ±  m·ml−·kg− as compared to the wol condition  ±  m·ml−·kg− only one subject displayed a lower re in the wl condition no significant differences were found between hr p   st p   or sr p   between footwear conditions but running in the wl condition lowered rpe p   conclusions the presence of external forefoot actuator lugs improved re by  although the mechanisms explaining this improvement are not clearhttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranarticles peerreviewedhttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranhttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranarticles peerreviewedeffects of tensioning errors in split transfers of tibialis anterior and posterior tendonshttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranbackground split transfers of the tibialis anterior and posterior tendons are commonly performed to address hindfoot varus deformities in patients with cerebral palsy stroke or brain injury poor outcomes from these procedures are often attributed to a failure to tension the transferred tendon properly but the mechanical effects of this aspect of the procedure have not been quantified to our knowledge the purpose of the present study was to use a cadaver model to examine changes in the actions of these muscles that occur when the tensions in the halves of the split tendon are intentionally balanced or unbalanced to varying degrees methods tendon excursion was measured in seven cadaveric specimens before and after split tendon transfer with experimentally controlled tensions in the halves of the split tendon the muscle moment arm a quantitative indicator of the action of a muscle about a joint axis was calculated as the derivative of tendon excursion with respect to the subtalar joint angle results the tibialis anterior had an eversion moment arm with the subtalar joint in a neutral position following surgery but the tibialis posterior had virtually no action in the neutral position following the split transfers with ideally balanced tension subtalar joint rotations of ° strongly influenced the moment arm of the tibialis posterior p   indicating that its action depends on the position of the hindfoot the moment arm of the tibialis anterior however was influenced only by rotations of ≥° p   for each angle pair comparison of conclusions these results suggest that it is possible for a split tendon transfer to be successful over a large range of tensionings split transfer of the tibialis posterior tendon produced the desired mechanical outcome in that the tibialis posterior had an eversion moment arm when the foot was inverted and an inversion moment arm when the foot was everted split transfer of the tibialis anterior to the cuboid however produced a muscle that consistently functioned as an everter regardless of the position of the hindfoot clinical relevance residual varus and overcorrection following a split tendon transfer are often attributed to technical errors in balancing the tension between the medial and lateral tendon halves the findings of the present study however suggest that such surgical failures are likely caused by only the largest of imbalances in tendon tensionhttpsworksbepresscommatthewmoranarticles peerreviewed
