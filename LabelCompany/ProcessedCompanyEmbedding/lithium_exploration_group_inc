exploration group announces new product offerings at morinville disposal facility scottsdale az marketwired  lithium exploration group inc otcqb lexg today announces that alta disposals morinville facility has clarified approvals to resume acceptance of waste streams that were approved at the facility under the prior operator this allows the facility to accept more forms of liquid waste because up to today the facility has only been disposing of produced water from oil and gas production some of these other forms of liquid waste are fluids generated from tank and floor washing in chemical plant operation fluids generated from tank washing of bulk carriers and fluids generated from washing of upgrading and refining plant equipment these fluids command variable but considerably higher price to dispose of than traditional produced water confirmation of the ability to handle a wider variety of fluids is expected in the very near future  these new product offerings will expand our reach in the region and give us a lot more flexibility in dealing with potential customers commented ceo alex walsh alta disposals goal as a company is to provide exceptional customer service and competitive pricing in the market that combination along with the technological advantages that we bring will make us a formidable competitor in the multibillion dollar waste disposal industry about
