philosophyin order to deliver attractive longterm investment performance– and to do so sustainably – we have given considerable thought to the way we manage our firm in particular we have established powerful incentives against making decisions that are at the expense of future investment performancedownload our organisational philosophy in pdf »  continuity of private ownershipbeing a contrarian investor requires being out of sync with conventional thinking and being painfully wrong at times that creates career risk for individual decisionmakers and pressure for the owners of a firm as a firm that is owned by the key investment decisionmakers our ownership structure is designed to give our people the freedom to make tough unpopular decisions and stick with them this is also true from an operational perspective we believe our ability as a firm and as individuals to focus on the very long term without the pressure to produce shortterm results is an enduring competitive advantage in this industry for more information on our ownership structure please click herewilliam grayinvestment team  alignment of interestsperformance fees and coinvestment help to ensure that our success is aligned with that of our clients our fees have always been designed to reward us for superior performance as well as penalise us for underperformance making the firm’s profitability much more sensitive to investment performance than growth in assets under management under our refundable reserve fee structure we refund performance fees to our clients in periods of underperformance we also offer larger investors a pure refundable performance fee structure—in other words we only get paid if we outperform coinvestment further reinforces this focus on performance orbis’ founders owners management and employees invest alongside clients and pay the same fees indeed as a group they are the largest single investor in our funds we therefore have powerful incentives to behave as responsible stewards of our clients’ capitaljimmy chanquantitative analyst  individual accountabilitywe believe contrarian investment decisions are best made by individuals not groups our investment process has therefore always been designed to encourage individual thinking and accountability for all members of the firm individual performance is evaluated in terms of value added for clients our detailed performance attribution systems track the results of individual investment decisions allowing an objective assessment of each persons contribution in addition to acting as an early warning system and helping to highlight areas of improvementben prestonequity analyst  building sustainabilitysince inception we have recognised that assets under management will inevitably grow if we are successful on behalf of our clients such growth presents both opportunities and challenges to maximise the likelihood that we can meet those challenges we have chosen to invest heavily in maintaining and developing our investment and operational capabilities our ownership structure provides the foundation that enables us to prioritise such longterm investments over shortterm profitability while our performancebased fee structures act as a powerful incentive against gathering assets at the expense of investment performancedan brocklebankequity analystwilliam gray  investment team jimmy chan

is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first
