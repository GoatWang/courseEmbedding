article linkedin email print talk courtesy of starz june    am pt lionsgate has sealed an agreement to acquire premium cabler starz in a  billion cash and stock deal the deal had been expected the two companies have flirted with a merger on and off for more than a year the two were united in a corporate marriage early last year by investor john malone the majority shareholder in starz who also acquired a stake in lionsgate last year malone’s stake in lionsgate will grow through the starz acquisition pact as he will receive voting and nonvoting lionsgate shares in exchange for his preferred starz class b stock malone’s personal stake in lionsgate is believed to grow to about  of voting power in the company with the transaction in addition the maloneaffiliated liberty global and discovery communications each hold  stakes in lionsgate lionsgate said the deal in total values starz shares at  an  premium over the day average trading price for starz as of june  starz shares have been on the rise for the past few months as acquisition rumors heated up related starz lionsgate may finally tie the knot “this transaction unites two companies with strong brands complementary assets and leading positions within our industry” said lionsgate ceo jon feltheimer and vice chairman michael burns “we expect the acquisition to be highly accretive generate significant synergies and create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts starz ceo chris albrecht and his team have built a worldclass platform and programming leader and we’re proud to marshal our resources in a deal that accelerates our growth and diversification generates exciting new strategic content opportunities and creates significant value for our shareholders” the deal calls for starz shareholders to receive  in cash and nonvoting shares in lionsgate the transaction will see lionsgate shares reclassified into voting and nonvoting shares a structure that is common in maloneaffiliated companies malone’s investment in starz was a personal holding rather than through his libertybranded holding companies however liberty media ceo greg maffei serves as chairman of starz “jon michael and the rest of the lionsgate team have built the first major new hollywood studio in decades and we’re thrilled to join with them in a transaction that multiplies the strengths of our respective businesses” said albrecht who earlier this week signed new employment contract that runs through  “our similar entrepreneurial cultures and shared vision of the future will make this alliance an incredible fit that creates tremendous value for our shareholders great content for our audiences and limitless opportunities for our newlycombined company i am very appreciative of the work passion and dedication of both of our companies’ employees and more enthusiastic than ever about the future of our business” lionsgate said it expects to fund the deal with a combination of loans and bonds it will raise the studio’s debt leverage to  to  times earnings although the cash flow provided by starz will help them whittle down that debt the company said the deal is expected to close by yearend the big question raised by the deal is how it will affect lionsgate’s participation in epix the premium movie channel it owns with viacom and mgm lionsgate has about a  stake in epix which has been the pay tv home for its movies since  in the short term execs said the epix partnership will remain intact another potential hurdle on the horizon during the period when the deal closes is a renewal of starz’s carriage agreement with att’s directv the singlelargest mvpd in the nation the deal at present is worth an estimated  million a year to starz if att decides to flex muscle and hammer starz for concessions that deal could affect the underlying projections for the merger lionsgate and starz billed the union as a natural fit of a studio that is increasingly invested in highend tv content and a premium cable group that has momentum with original programming for the first time since its launch in  starz’s buzzy dramas at present include “outlander” and “power” starz has deemphasized its focus on theatrical movies in the past few years under albrecht sony pictures is the only studio with which starz has a movie output deal that pact runs through  starz will give lionsgate a strong platform to launch series that can be sold around the world starz is at the outset of expanding its reach internationally it also followed the lead of premium rivals hbo and showtime by launching a standalone broadbandonly offering to reach viewers who don’t have a traditional pay tv package “chris albrecht and his team have grown starz into an industry leader that provides highlyrated and diverse content drawing critical claim and brand recognition for starz” maffei said “together lionsgate and starz form an entertainment powerhouse with a worldrenowned studio that produces blockbuster movies and channels with musthave programming that will be able to capitalize on content opportunities across multiple platforms the combined company will be wellpositioned to return more value to our shareholders and effectively compete in the global media marketplace” starz brings to lionsgate a collection of  starz and encorebranded premium channels it also owns the anchor bay entertainment home video distribution banner which has handled weinstein co film releases among other thirdparty content lionsgate’s library of film and tv series will surely offer a boost to the schedules of the starz and encore channels beyond the flagship starz network touting the scope of the deal lionsgate told investors in a conference call monday that the combined company would invest  billion annually in new film and tv content if the deal is completed starz’s network operations will account for  of the enlarged company’s  operating income on a pro forma basis with lionsgate film operations delivering  and its tv production arm delivering  liontree advisors and raine group are serving as financial advisors to starz in the transaction pjt partners is lead advisor to lionsgate along with jp morgan
