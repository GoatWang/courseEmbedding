principles accepted generally in the usa these principles require management to use its best judgment in determining estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and

best estimate of the ultimate outcome for such items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared changes in estimates are recognized in

financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse   the company operates in several countries as a result we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions and tax agreements and treaties among the various taxing authorities our operations in these jurisdictions are taxed on various bases income before taxes deemed profits and withholding taxes based on revenue the calculation of our tax liabilities involves consideration of uncertainties in the application and interpretation of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations   we regularly assess our position with regard to individual tax exposures and record liabilities for our uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties these accruals reflect managements view of the likely outcomes of current and future audits the future resolution of these uncertain tax positions may be different from the amounts currently accrued and therefore could impact future tax period expense   changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year   recent

of operations the mda is organized as follows     · caution concerning forwardlooking statements and risk factors this section discusses how certain forwardlooking statements made by us throughout the mda and in the financial statements are based on our present expectations about future events and are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances   · overview this section

judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities   forwardlooking statements   we have sought to identify what we believe to be the most significant risks to our business but we cannot predict whether or to what extent any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that we have identified all possible risks that might arise investors should carefully consider all of such risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this document in addition to historical information the following discussion and other parts of this document contain certain forwardlooking information when used in this discussion the words believes anticipates expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results due to a number of factors beyond our control we do not undertake to publicly update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements even if experience or future changes show that the indicated results or events will not be realized readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date hereof readers are also urged to carefully review and consider our discussions regarding the various factors which affect our business included in this section and elsewhere in this report   factors that might cause actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those projected or implied in such forwardlooking statements include among other things i the impact of competitive products ii changes in law and regulations iii limitations on future financing iv increases in the cost of borrowings and unavailability of debt or equity capital v our inability to gain andor hold market share vi managing and maintaining growth vii customer demands viii market and industry conditions ix the success of product development and new product introductions into the marketplace x the departure of key members of management as well as other risks and uncertainties that are described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission                limited market due to penny stock   the companys stock differs from many stocks in that it is a penny stock the securities and exchange commission has adopted a number of rules to regulate penny stock these rules include but are not limited to rules all g g g g g g and g under the securities and exchange act of  as amended because our securities probably constitute penny stock within the meaning of the rules the rules would apply to us and our securities the rules may further affect the ability of owners of our stock to sell their securities in any market that may develop for them there may be a limited market for penny stocks due to the regulatory burdens on brokerdealers the market among dealers may not be active investors in penny stock often are unable to sell stock back to the dealer that sold them the stock the markups or commissions charged by the brokerdealers may be greater than any profit a seller may make because of large dealer spreads investors may be unable to sell the stock immediately back to the dealer at the same price the dealer sold the stock to the investor in some cases the stock may fall quickly in value investors may be unable to reap any profit from any sale of the stock if they can sell it at all stockholders should be aware that according to the securities and exchange commission release no   the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse these patterns include  control of the market for the security by one or a few brokerdealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer  manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases  boiler room practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons  excessive and undisclosed bidask differentials and markups by selling brokerdealers and  the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses furthermore the penny stock designation may adversely affect the development of any public market for the companys shares of common stock or if such a market develops its continuation brokerdealers are required to personally determine whether an investment in penny stock is suitable for customers penny stocks are securities i with a price of less than five dollars per share ii that are not traded on a recognized national exchange iii whose prices are not quoted on the nasdaq automated quotation system nasdaqlisted stocks must still meet requirement i above or iv of an issuer with net tangible assets less than  if the issuer has been in continuous operation for at least three years or  if in continuous operation for less than three years or with average annual revenues of less than  for the last three years section g of the exchange act and rule g of the commission require brokerdealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor‘s account potential investors in the company‘s common stock are urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that are deemed to be penny stock rule g of the commission requires brokerdealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor this procedure requires the brokerdealer to i obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation investment experience and investment objectives ii reasonably determine based on that information that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions iii provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the brokerdealer made the determination in ii above and iv receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor confirming that it accurately reflects the investors financial situation investment experience and investment objectives compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult for the companys stockholders to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them    overview of the company and its operations   the company sold all its business in the  th quarter of  it has no business operation as of the date of this report   sancons visions and goals   after the disposal of all its business in  the directors are now looking for viable business that it can acquire in asia   employees   as of march   the company had no employees   factors that may affect future results   the companys ability to execute its business strategy and to sustain its operations depends upon its ability to maintain or procure capital there can be no absolute assurance the necessary amount of capital will continue to be available to the company on favorable terms or at all the companys inability to obtain sufficient capital would limit the companys ability to i acquire new business and ii fund its working capital needs the companys access to capital may have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition andor results of operations                there can be no absolute assurance the company will be able to effectively manage its existing or the possible future expansion of its operations or the companys systems procedures or controls will be adequate to support the companys operations consequently the companys business financial condition andor results of operations could be possibly and adversely affected   as a public company sancon is subject to certain regulatory requirements including but not limited to compliance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  sox such compliance results in significant additional costs to the company by increased audit and consulting fees and the time required by management to address the regulations   results of operations  comparison between the three months period ended march   and the same period in    revenue   the company had no revenues for the three months period ended march   and the same period in    general and administrative expenses   general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the three months ended march

accompanying financial statements the company has accumulated loss of  as of march   compared to  as of december   there was a working capital deficit of  on march   and it was  as of december   it has increased by  the change is mainly due to increase in the loans from related parties   operating activities   the net cash flows used in operating activities for the three months period ended march   was  compared to  for the three months period ended march   the decrease is attributed to decrease in net loss and increase in accrued expenses and other payables   financing activities   the net cash flows provided by financing activities for the three months period ended march   was  compared to  for the three months period ended march   the company financed its growth by utilizing cash reserves loans from directors and issuance of common shares loans from directors were unsecured and deferred payment term and without interest bearing the company’s primary use of funds was for operation expense and working capital                critical accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances future events however may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions while there are a number of significant accounting policies affecting our financial statements we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most complex difficult and subjective estimates and judgments allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes stockbased compensation asset impairment    stockbased compensation   effective january   the beginning of sancons first fiscal quarter of  the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r asc  using the modifiedprospective transition method under this transition method stockbased compensation expense was recognized in the consolidated financial statements for granted stock options since the related purchase discounts exceeded the amount allowed under sfas rasc  for noncompensatory treatment compensation expense recognized included the estimated expense for stock options granted on and subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas rasc  and the estimated expense for the portion vesting in the period for options granted prior to but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas asc  results for prior periods have not been restated as provided for under the modifiedprospective method   on december   the

and share options listed in the settlement agreement the company would give the option to dragon wings to purchase  common shares the option may be exercised by dragon wings in whole or in part at any time within  years from the date of this settlement agreement with the exercise price at us per share with dilution protection and subject to share split adjustment   for other items paid for by

number of share to be issued is the value of the average price for the  to  days prior to the transaction date   item b offbalance sheet arrangements   there are no offbalance sheet arrangements that

with operations based in australia and china sancon exported more than  tons of recycled industrial waste material annually to its processing partners and manufacturers in china sancons main operations and services included industrial waste management consulting collection and reprocess of recyclable materials such as glass plastic cardboard and paper before its reentry into manufacture cycles as raw materials the use of recycled material is both environmentally friendly and is a key part of the competitive manufacturing process to lower costs chinese manufacturers are increasingly turning to recycled materials to lower costs the major customers for sancon were chinese manufacturers and recycled material traders such as pernod ricard hing yang hong which are located mainly in the chinese provinces of shanghai guangdong zhejiang and fujian the business operation of the company was carried out through its subsidiaries in  the company divested all its subsidiaries the company currently has no active business activities plan of operation the company is actively looking for acquisition and merger opportunities in growth industries in asia critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances future events however may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions while there are a number of significant accounting policies affecting our financial statements we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most complex difficult and subjective estimates and judgments revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured noted below are brief descriptions of the product or service revenues that the company recognizes in the financial statements contained herein the company was organized into two businesses material recycling and waste management service their revenue recognition is as follows  material recycling refers to the activities of collecting and processing of waste materials then selling them to customers in china the plant is located in australia the revenue is recognized when delivery of the material is occurred and invoice issued  waste management service refers the activities of providing waste management service with operations located in shanghai china the revenue is recognized when service is completed and invoice is issued allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce amounts to their estimated realizable value a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of accounts receivables including assessing the probability of collection and the current creditworthiness of each customer if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments an additional provision for doubtful accounts could be required we initially record a provision for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and then adjust this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts we consider i the aging of the accounts receivable ii trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable iii the customer mix in each of the aging categories and the nature of the receivable iv our historical provision for doubtful accounts income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no asc  accounting for income taxes sfas  prescribes the use of the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period we increase or decrease our income tax provision in our statement of operations if any of our estimates of our prior period taxable income or loss prove to be incorrect material differences could impact the amount and timing of income tax benefits or payments for any period in addition as a result of the significant change in the companys ownership the companys future use of its existing net operating losses may be limited the company operated in several countries as a result we were subject to numerous domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions and tax agreements and treaties among the various taxing authorities our operations in these jurisdictions were taxed on various bases income before taxes deemed profits and withholding taxes based on revenue the calculation of our tax liabilities involved consideration of uncertainties in the application and interpretation of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due the tax liabilities are reflected net of realized tax loss carry forwards we adjust these reserves upon specific events however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the contingency has been resolved and the liabilities are no longer necessary changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year stockbased compensation effective january   the beginning of sancons first fiscal quarter of  the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r asc  using the modifiedprospective transition method under this transition method stockbased compensation expense was recognized in the financial statements for granted stock options since the related purchase discounts exceeded the amount allowed under sfas rasc  for noncompensatory treatment compensation expense recognized included the estimated expense for stock options granted on and subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r asc  and the estimated expense for the portion vesting in the period for options granted prior to but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas asc  results for prior periods have not been restated as provided for under the modifiedprospective method on december   the company entered into a settlement agreement with dragon wings for the settlement of the claim by dragon wings in consideration of sancons agreement to make the payments in the form of common shares and share options listed in the settlement agreement the company would give the option to dragon wings to purchase  common shares the option may be exercised by dragon wings in whole or in part at any time within  years from the date of this settlement agreement with the exercise price at us per share with dilution protection and subject to share split adjustment for other items paid for by common stock the value of the transaction is determined by the value of the goods or services received measured at the time of the transaction the corresponding stock value used to determine the number of share to be issued is the value of the average price for the  to  days prior to the transaction date asset impairment we periodically evaluate the carrying value of other longlived assets including but not limited to property and equipment and intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is less than its carrying value in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the longlived asset fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved significant estimates are utilized to calculate expected future cash flows utilized in impairment analyses we also utilize judgment to determine other factors within fair value analyses including the applicable discount rate results of operations two years ended december   and  revenue the company had no revenues in  and  other income we had other income of  in  and nil in  attributable to the writeoff of amount due to related party general and administrative expenses general and administrative
