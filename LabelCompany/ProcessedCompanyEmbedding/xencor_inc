pipeline – xencor a deep pipeline of xmab antibody drug candidates xmab antibodies are being developed by xencor and our partners in  different programs for the treatment of lifethreatening and debilitating diseases our four primary xmab fc domains are designed to improve therapeutic antibody performance by enhancing immune regulation cytotoxic potency or circulating halflife or by creating bispecific antibody structures that are stable longacting and readily produced the plugandplay nature of each domain has enabled the rapid discovery of a portfolio of differentiated drug candidates with a diversity of mechanisms targets and potential disease indications this clinical portfolio diversity all from a common basis in fc domain design creates a breadth of opportunities for xencor

biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases asthma and allergic diseases and cancer today announced that the first patient has been dosed in a phase b multidose trial of subcutaneously administered xmab® a potential treatment for allergic disease   a previously completed phase a study of intravenous administration of xmab has shown potent suppression of ige in particular demonstrating the rapid clearance of ige from the circulation while being generally well tolerated by patients said paul foster md chief medical officer at xencor we expect to report interim data from this phase b subcutaneous trial in  complete data results from a phase a firstinhuman study for iv administration of xmab were presented at the american thoracic society ats  international conference in may  data showed that iv xmab was generally well tolerated with transient asymptomatic thrombocytopenia reported at doses ≥ mgkg and induced rapid and extensive depletion of serum ige at all doses tested including in high ige subjects the poster is available on the events and presentations page of xencors website under archived scientific presentations at httpinvestorsxencorcomeventscfm for more information about this phase b subcutaneous xmab clinical trial please visit to wwwclinicaltrialsgov identifier nct    about xmab® a first in class monoclonal antibody that targets ige with its variable domain and uses xencors xmab® immune inhibitor fc domain to target fcgriib resulting in three distinct mechanisms of action for reducing ige levels for the potential treatment of allergic disease xmab acts by  sequestering free ige to block ige signaling  suppressing bcell differentiation into igesecreting plasma cells and  clearing ige from circulation total ige reduction differentiates xmab from other antiige therapeutic antibodies that actually increase total ige levels because total ige assays unlike free ige assays are readily available to clinicians the effect of xmab on total ige levels could enable for the first time simple monitoring and potentially adjustment of antiige therapy  about xencors xmab® immune inhibitor technology fcγriib iib also called cdb is a receptor for fc domains on b cells and other immune cells when engaged the iib receptor blocks immune activation pathways and traffics bound soluble antigens out of circulation xencor has discovered a series of fc domain variants with up to a fold increase in binding affinity to fcγriib derived from just two amino acid changes these xmab® immune inhibitor fc domains greatly heighten the properties of iib receptor engagement and have potential as building blocks for drug candidates in autoimmune allergic and inflammatory diseases about xencor inc xencor is a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases asthma and allergic diseases and cancer currently
