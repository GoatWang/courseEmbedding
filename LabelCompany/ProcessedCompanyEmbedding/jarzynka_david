compact cooler is a compact highperformance cooling system that brings new levels of efficiency and reliability to demanding applications such as highresolution digital imaging analytical chemistry life sciences materials analysis semiconductor inspection scientific research and water vapor cryotrapping pgc gas chillers pgc gas chillers pgc gas chillers cool compressed dry gases such as nitrogen argon or air from ambient to cryogenic temperature without precooling pgc gas chillers are closedloop refrigeration systems that cool a nonrecirculating gas stream using a refrigerant to gas tubeintube heat exchanger maxcool cryochillers maxcool cryochillers polycold maxcool cryochillers are closed loop cryogenic refrigeration systems that provide up to  watts or  watts of cooling respectively these cryochillers can be used to capture water vapor and other condensable substances by freezing them onto a cold surface such as a cryocoil or chevron baffle maxcool cryochillers are also used to cool and heat objects such as electrostatic chucks used in semiconductor wafer processing pfc water vapor cryochiller pfc water vapor cryochiller the brooks polycold® pfc water vapor cryochiller effectively captures water vapor which typically comprises  to  of the gas load in high vacuum systems it pumps vapor within minutes of “start” defrosts in less than four minutes and lowers water vapor partial pressure during processing for higher quality better adhesion and more reproducible deposition cryodyne refrigerators cryodyne refrigerators cryodyne refrigeration systems are a family of twostage closedcycle helium refrigeration systems based on the giffordmcmahon thermodynamic cycle they offer usable heat lift from 0k to 0k making them highly suitable for a variety of
