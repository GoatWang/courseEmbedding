reports second quarter  results company release    pm et deerfield ill july   prnewswire  essendant inc nasdaq esnd a leading national wholesale distributor of workplace items today announced financial results for the second quarter ended june    key results for second quarter  were as follows second quarter  summary revenue declined  to  billion compared to  billion in the prior year quarter gaap diluted earnings per share in the quarter of  decreased compared to  in the prior year quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of  in the quarter increased sequentially from the first quarter of  but decreased compared to  in the prior year quarter free cash flow was  million in the quarter and  million in the first six months of  we made good progress advancing our merchandising and pricing initiatives and our industrial products category delivered growth for the second quarter in a row  however this was offset by top line pressure that is reflective of persistent industry challenges stated ric phillips interim president and chief executive officer of essendant  in light of this pressure we will continue to advance our transformation initiatives and we will look to build on and accelerate our transformation in the second half of  second quarter performance net sales decreased  in comparison to the prior year quarter driven principally by reduced sales in technology jansan and traditional office products categories partly offset by growth in cutsheet paper and industrial products categories net sales by product category were jansan products revenues of  million a decrease of  million or  primarily driven by declines in the national retail channel technology products revenues of  million a decrease of  million or  as a result of reduced supplier promotions and declines in the national retail channel and the independent dealer channels traditional office products revenues of  million a decrease of  million or  due to sales declines in the independent dealer channel and the national retail channel industrial products revenues of  million an increase of  million or  due to growth initiatives and energy market recovery cutsheet paper products revenues of  million an increase of  million or  primarily driven by independent dealer channel sales increases automotive products revenues of  million an increase of  million or  driven by growth initiatives office furniture revenues of  million a decrease of  million or  primarily driven by sales declines in the independent dealer channel gross profit was  million a decline of  million versus the prior year quarter the decline was the result of lower sales volumes  million with the remainder of the decline primarily driven by lower supplier allowances sales volume and supplier allowance declines more than offset the benefits of merchandising and pricing actions related to our transformation initiatives operating expenses were  million a decrease from  million in the prior year quarter resulting from prior year pension settlement expense of  million creating a favorable comparison partially offset by current year quarter transformational expenses of  million and litigation accruals of  million reflecting an agreement to resolve a litigation matter adjusted operating expenses were  million a decrease of  million which was primarily driven by overall cost containment actions including decreased variable labor expenses partially offset by a reset of management incentives income tax expense was  million in the second quarter of  a decline from  million in the prior year quarter due to lower pretax income partially offset by the impact of adopting new accounting guidance related to sharebased compensation gaap diluted earnings per share was  compared to  in the quarter last year adjusted diluted earnings per share were  compared to  in the quarter last year free cash flow totaled  million in the quarter reflecting continued working capital management and the timing of inventory receipts utilization of free cash flow from lower inventories drove a reduction in longterm debt of  million during the quarter outlook for  in light of the first half sales results we anticipate full year  sales to decline  to  from  similar to our experience in the first half of  we expect the range of  sales decline to affect our second half adjusted diluted earnings per share based on strong cash flow generation in the first half of  free cash flow generation is expected to be in excess of  million for the full year  conference call essendant

the quarter increased sequentially from the first quarter of  but decreased compared to  in the prior year quarter free cash flow was  million in the quarter and  million in the first six months of  we made good progress advancing our merchandising and pricing initiatives and our industrial products category delivered growth for the second quarter in a row  however this was offset by top line pressure that is reflective of persistent industry challenges stated ric phillips interim president and chief executive officer of essendant  in light of this pressure we will continue to advance our transformation initiatives and we will look to build on and accelerate our transformation in the second half of  second quarter performance net sales decreased  in comparison to the prior year quarter driven principally by reduced sales in technology jansan and traditional office products categories partly offset by growth in cutsheet paper and industrial products categories net sales by product category were jansan products revenues of  million a decrease of  million or  primarily driven by declines in the national retail channel technology products revenues of  million a decrease of  million or  as a result of reduced supplier promotions and declines in the national retail channel and the independent dealer channels traditional office products revenues of  million a decrease of  million or  due to sales declines in the independent dealer channel and the national retail channel industrial products revenues of  million an increase of  million or  due to growth initiatives and energy market recovery cutsheet paper products revenues of  million an increase of  million or  primarily driven by independent dealer channel sales increases automotive products revenues of  million an increase of  million or  driven by growth initiatives office furniture revenues of  million a decrease of  million or  primarily driven by sales declines in the independent dealer channel gross profit was  million a decline of  million versus the prior year quarter the decline was the result of lower sales volumes  million with the remainder of the decline primarily driven by lower supplier allowances sales volume and supplier allowance declines more than offset the benefits of merchandising and pricing actions related to our transformation initiatives operating expenses were  million a decrease from  million in the prior year quarter resulting from prior year pension settlement expense of  million creating a favorable comparison partially offset by current year quarter transformational expenses of  million and litigation accruals of  million reflecting an agreement to resolve a litigation matter adjusted operating expenses were  million a decrease of  million which was primarily driven by overall cost containment actions including decreased variable labor expenses partially offset by a reset of management incentives income tax expense was  million in the second quarter of  a decline from  million in the prior year quarter due to lower pretax income partially offset by the impact of adopting new accounting guidance related to sharebased compensation gaap diluted earnings per share was  compared to  in the quarter last year adjusted diluted earnings per share were  compared to  in the quarter last year free cash flow totaled  million in the quarter reflecting continued working capital management and the timing of inventory receipts utilization of free cash flow from lower inventories drove a reduction in longterm debt of  million during the quarter outlook for  in light of the first half sales results we anticipate full year  sales to decline  to  from  similar to our experience in the first half of  we expect the range of  sales decline to affect our second half adjusted diluted earnings per share based on strong cash flow generation in the first half of  free cash flow generation is expected to be in excess of  million for the full
