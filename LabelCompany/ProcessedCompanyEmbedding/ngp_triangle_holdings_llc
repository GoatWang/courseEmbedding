commodities longshort equity research analystmarketplacezeits oil analyticssummarywith no restructuring support agreement with creditors secured so far triangle is running out of timethe concern is reinforced by triangle’s disclosure of a failed negotiation with its largest investora free fall filing cannot be ruled out important note this article is not an investment recommendation and should not to be relied upon when making investment decisions  investors should conduct their own comprehensive research please read the disclaimer at the end of this article i wrote in my april  note with regard to the outlook for a triangle petroleum nysemkttplm balance sheet restructuring can a reorganization at tusa be avoided at this point while a hope always exists there is not a single tangible sign or argument that i personally can find in support of such a scenario as one can see from the chapter  filing by energy xxi nasdaqotcexxi this week a reorganization in the current commodity price environment can be devastating for junior stake holder classes as it effectively locks in asset valuations based on the current extremely low commodity prices curtailing any upside from a potential cyclical recovery while triangle petroleum corporation has not released any statement regarding the results of its restructuring effort there are multiple signs that the outcome may indeed be unfavorable to the existing tplm shareholders triangle faces an important deadline on may   in the absence of a restructuring support agreement by that date a risk of a free fall filing is high the may   deadline as a reminder triangle petroleum corporation has a holding company structure with the majority of the companys borrowings being at the operating subsidiary level triangle petroleum usa or tusa the ep subsidiary has two debt components  million first lien credit agreement  million in principal amount of  senior unsecured notes the holding company has  million of  convertible notes as of october   including  million of accrued interest source triangle petroleum corporation december  on april   tusa received notice from the administrative agent under its credit agreement that the borrowing base under the agreement had been redetermined and reduced to  million from  million effective as of april   as of april  tusa had  million of outstanding borrowings and  million of outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility or  million in excess of the redetermined borrowing base under the agreement tusa had  days after the notification to elect to cure the borrowing base deficiency triangle stated in its disclosure that tusa expects to elect to repay the borrowing base deficiency in three equal monthly installments the first payment of which is due by may   as of april  tusa had cash on hand of approximately  million while theoretically tusa may elect to pay the first installment on may  a more likely scenario is a comprehensive restructuring agreement in the absence of such agreement triangle may have to consider a free fall filing for protection under chapter  to preserve precious liquidity in the system restructuring discussions with ngp end without result on may  triangle disclosed that it had engaged into discussions with its major shareholder ngp triangle holdings llc ngp in connection with a potential consensual restructuring or recapitalization of triangle specifically triangle stated in its k filing …by this filing we disclose that i the company engaged in discussions with ngp with respect to the terms of the potential restructuring and ii such discussions terminated without the parties reaching agreement discussions between ngp and the company may resume at any time and the company undertakes no obligation to disclose the existence or nature of such discussions until an agreement has been reached between the parties while it is difficult to discern the bid and ask in these negotiations the disclosure does not sound particularly encouraging from the holding company investor perspective the outlook is worrisome the borrowing base redetermination which reduced the borrowing base to just  million indicates that the first lien lenders assigned a relatively low value to the companys proved reserves even though oil prices have been moving higher one can easily envision a scenario where in the event of a reorganization under chapter  both the tusa first lien credit agreement and tusa senior unsecured notes would be deemed impaired claim classes which likely puts the tusa unsecured noteholders into a position of significant control while there is always a hope that a prepack restructuring agreement would be achieved whereby the holding company triangle petroleum corporation receives some distribution under the restructuring plan there are several signs that such a scenario is not particularly probable first triangle appears to be giving up the fight for a recovery of its investment in rockpile the completion services operating subsidiary in a recent press release rockpile announced that after conducting an extensive evaluation triangle and rockpile have mutually agreed to pursue strategic alternatives that would allow both companies to separately and independently execute on their business strategies and operational plans my interpretation is that triangle may have elected to turn the keys over to rockpile lenders second ngp disclosed sales of  tplm shares that took place on may  and may  at prices of approximately  and  per share while the sold shares represent a small percentage of the total holdings by ngp the disclosure reinforces the concern with regard to the outcome for tplm shareholders for indepth data and analysis of commodity fundamentals please consider
