bernstein advisors quality income portfolio series  the dividend attraction investors have treasured dividendpaying stocks for ages and recent performance has justified the love the sp dow jones indices announced that total dividend distributions for us common stocks increased by a net increases less decreases  billion in q down from the  billion increase in q according to its own release for the month period ended june  net dividend increases totaled  billion up from an increase of  billion for the month period ended june  in q there were  dividend increases up from the  dividend increases in q the number of dividends cut or suspended totaled  down from the  cut or suspended in q perhaps the hardest thing for an individual investor to do is to weed out quality dividendpaying businesses from all the rest the quality income approach the richard bernstein advisors quality income portfolio is a unit investment trust uit focused on total return through a combination of dividend income and capital appreciation a uit is an investment vehicle which consists of a professionally selected unmanaged portfolio of securities which are held for a predetermined period of time the value of the units of the trust will fluctuate each day with the value of the underlying securities therefore it is possible to lose money by investing in the trust the stocks are selected for the trust by richard bernstein advisors llc rba using their comprehensive quality income strategy and held for approximately  months this strategy attempts to control the risks associated with investing in higheryielding stocks yet maintain attractive current income rba believes risk actually increases as dividend yield increases and that simply investing in highyield equities often leads to selecting stocks whose dividends are subsequently cut or discontinued rbas strategy incorporates several layers of risk control in order to attempt to minimize the probability of dividend cuts and the related underperformance rba portfolio selection process the stock market is often far ahead of investors in predicting dividend cuts or omissions many stocks that offer extremely high dividend yields get there not by increasing their dividends but by virtue of their stock price dropping significantly thus dramatically increasing their yield in addition there is typically a sound business reason for a stock to tumble and it usually involves business problems for the company in such circumstances it is reasonable to expect a competent board of directors to cut dividends to conserve cash because of this effect rba believes stocks with extremely high dividend yields should be viewed cautiously because high dividend yields may simply reflect depressed stock prices in anticipation of dividend cuts or omissions rba examines the security of dividends on the global high dividend yield universe by screening for debt levels and for consistency of earnings this process generally results in an unweighted portfolio of less than  stocks from the initial universe of several thousand rba then uses a proprietary optimization method to weight the stocks this final step attempts to reduce the volatility of the overall portfolio thus the strategy attempts to reduce risk in two ways first rba screens for estimated dividend consistency second rba uses a proprietary weighting method which strives to reduce overall portfolio volatility of course there can be no assurance that these objectives will be achieved in addition there is no guarantee that the issuers of the securities included in the portfolio will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will either remain at current levels or increase over time richard bernstein advisors rba is a registered investment adviser focusing on longer term investment strategies that combine topdown macroeconomic analysis and quantitativelydriven portfolio construction utilizing mr bernsteins widely recognized expertise in

managementunder advisement as of june   not fdic insured  not bank guaranteed  may lose value you should consider the portfolios investment objectives risks and charges and expenses carefully before investing contact your financial advisor or call first trust portfolios lp at  to request a prospectus which contains this and other information about the portfolio read it carefully before you invest risk considerations an investment in this unmanaged unit investment trust should be made with an understanding of the risks involved with owning common stocks such as an economic recession and the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of the issuers of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market certain of the securities in the portfolio are issued by real estate investment trusts reits companies involved in the real estate industry are subject to changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recession an investment in a portfolio containing smallcap and midcap companies is subject to additional risks as the share prices of smallcap companies and certain midcap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies due to several factors including limited trading volumes products financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information an investment in a portfolio containing equity securities of foreign issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers the value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers this uit is a buy and hold strategy and investors should consider their ability to hold the trust until maturity there may be tax consequences unless units are purchased in an ira or other qualified plan   the information in the prospectus is not complete and may be changed we may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with the

enable clients to achieve their financial goals toggle navigation advanced search subscribe log in whats in your etf portfolioby richard bernstein of richard bernstein advisors  etfs continue to play a highly disruptive role in money management rba has embraced this trend by employing what we refer to as pactive™ management which is the active allocation whether strategic or tactical of passive investment instruments such as etfs stock baskets and index funds these pactive™ portfolios have quickly become the fastest growing part of our business we have refuted the concerns of some critics of etfs however we join some of the naysayers when it comes to “factor etfs” our research suggests that factor etfs’ actual sources of returns often have little if anything to do with the factor included in the etf name ie value growth or size  factor as defined by a leading risk model provider xraying etfs rba’s approach to etf management is quite different from that of most etf managers our clients’ portfolios typically contain  etfs but internally at rba we manage the portfolio using the underlying holdings of the etfs ie as though our portfolio had hundreds or even thousands of securities when searching for a new etf rba looks beyond basic characteristics like management fees liquidity etc and searches for etfs that best fit with the existing etfs in the portfolio while aiming for certain overall portfoliolevel exposures those exposure goals might relate to size style sector geography quality yield etc we call this process of managing etf portfolios via the underlying holdings “xraying” the etfs and our xray analyses have become increasingly important as the number of etfs has multiplied because there are now so many etfs from which to choose our analyses have had to become more sophisticated to ensure that our clients’ portfolios are structured as closely as possible to the desired targeted exposures issue  the cyclicality of factors while at merrill lynch in  we began publishing quantitative profiles the “qp” as it was known was ground breaking at the time because it was the first widely published research that examined the cyclicality and efficacy of various stock selection strategies and factors this research led to a book called “style investing – unique insights into equity management” john wiley  sons  which was the seminal book regarding the timing of styles and factors our research clearly determined that styles and factors were highly cyclical and that one’s portfolio could have significant periods of underperformance if one naively invested in one side of a style decision eg small versus large capitalization stocks investors in today’s factor etfs must be cognizant of the potential cyclicality of factor performance and need to fully understand how the macroeconomy can influence a particular factor’s performance and for how long issue  are the potential returns of factor etfs driven by the named factor one would think that a factor etf’s performance would be driven by the factor advertised in its name our proprietary research shows that most factor etfs are hardly pure investments in the named factor worse yet the specific named factor often had little influence on a factor etf’s sources of potential return chart  shows the risk decomposition of some of the most popular “value” factor etfs the bars in the chart highlight that the proportion of the underlying value portfolios’ risk ie a source of potential return has been attributable to value growth other possible factors such as size momentum exchange rate sensitivity liquidity etc industry concentration and stock specific risk the dark green portion in each bar is the value contribution in no case was value the primary contributor to portfolio risk in any of the value etfs the largest contribution was about  in nearly every case industry exposure was a larger determinant of risk than was value in fairness some of these value factor etfs include a negative bet on growth however even the contribution of value and negativegrowth rarely outweighs the industry and stock specific risks source richard bernstein advisors axioma inc some etfs may show values below  or above  due to diversification benefits of certain factors which detract from portfolio variance we found similar issues with growth factor etfs chart  shows the risk decomposition of some popular growth etfs most of these etfs derive their growth exposure by taking a negative bet on value however it is clear in the chart that industry and stock specific risk overwhelm the growth and value factor exposures source richard bernstein advisors axioma inc the risk related to sizerelated etfs seems to be more associated with size as chart  highlights size contributes roughly  to the total risk of the major size etfs in one case however the combination of industry and stock specific risks is considerably larger than is the size risk source richard bernstein advisors axioma inc some etfs may show values below  or above  due to diversification benefits of certain factors which detract from portfolio variance what’s in your etf portfolio rba’s proprietary research examines both the timing of factor cyclicality and the factor risk decomposition of etfs we think both are critically important to successful etf portfolio investing our analyses of some of the most popular factor etfs suggest that the factor advertised in the etf’s name is rarely the primary source of a factor etf’s potential returns one might think one has a portfolio allocated to value within one’s portfolio only to find that the true allocation is to a particular industry our research over the past  years definitively shows that factor performance is highly cyclical the annual dalbar studies of mutual fund flows suggest that investors have been very poor timers of these factor cycles we strongly doubt that investors will be any more successful in their timing of growth and value etfs than they were in their timing of growth and value mutual funds so with apologies to the credit card company what’s in your etf portfolio special thanks to stacy hendler for her etf analysis  copyright

advisors  commentaries  advisor perspectives helping advisors enable clients to achieve their financial goals toggle navigation advanced search subscribe log in pactive® investingby richard bernstein of richard bernstein advisors   was a terrible year for the performance of active stock pickers according to bank of america merrill lynch  of us large cap active funds underperformed their benchmark although we doubt that stock pickers will continue to underperform quite as badly as they did last year investors seem to be waking up to the inherent performance problems for traditional active managers it is difficult for every stock picker to outperform when there are so many stock picking funds and so few managers willing to take sizable risks within their portfolios we are not stock pickers at rba we have never made a claim to be able to differentiate stock a from stock b and will never make such a claim rather our performance is based on meaningful macro positions based on asset allocation size style geography quality and other market segments pactive® investing the active management of passive investments like etfs is rba’s specialty the growing breadth and depth of the etf market leads us to believe that rba is uniquely positioned to combine the most important aspects of both passive and active management passive investments are not a panacea for poor active management when we started rba in  we emphasized that the firm was a manager of beta alpha is important but if one doesn’t make superior beta allocations then alpha can be totally irrelevant for example an active stock picking manager might outperform a benchmark by several hundred basis points but if the benchmark’s return was  then the investor nonetheless received a substantial negative return at rba we drive our alpha through beta allocation ie through macro decisions rather than through individual stock selection investors’ returns during the “lost decade” in equities were a perfect example of poor beta management the widely held view during the lates was that “stocks for the long term” was a winning strategy and that one couldn’t go wrong with a simple sp ® index fund unfortunately the sp r underperformed many other stock indices during the next  years the idea that a passive investment in this case an sp ® index fund was a definitive route to better returns was clearly wrong because investors had forgotten the most important decision was which index fund to buy and when today etfs are considered a solution to inferior active returns but the problems regarding which etf to buy and when to tactically buy them will likely continue to be a significant challenge chart  shows the relative performance between small cap and large cap us stocks the russell ® vs the sp ® small caps were outperforming large caps when the line is going up and vice versa small cap relative outperformance peaked in mid  and then proceeded to underperform for most of the next  years source bloomberg finance lp one might say this is an extreme and very longterm example but there are many shorterterm examples we could cite chart  shows a more recent example between emerging market stocks and us stocks coming out of the  bear market most asset allocators favored emerging market stocks over us stocks however a portfolio allocated to emerging markets anytime from  to  would have significantly underperformed one allocated to us stocks source bloomberg finance lp although many profess to be “longterm investors” the turns in asset class leadership can be very meaningful even year by year and often have a backwardlooking effect on investor positioning chart  shows asset class performance during  when global profitability was waning versus asset class performance in  when global profitability was accelerating some of ’s worst performing asset classes became ’s best performers investors should clearly have a longterm strategic investment plan but tactical allocation can have a consequential impact on portfolio performance source richard bernstein advisors llc msci hfri standard  poors bofa merrill lynch bloomberg for index descriptors see “index descriptions” at end of document anyone can do thismaybe not one might think that allocation of etfs is easier than picking active managers and therefore anyone can be a pactive® manager several points suggest otherwise rba has trademarked pactive® because we feel our macrobased approach to investing is quite unique for more insight as to how rba approaches etf selection and allocation please see this earlier report httprbadvisorscomimagespdfswhatsinyouretfportfoliopdf regardless of whether one uses passive etfs or active mutual funds one must remember that both are simply portfolios of assets investors’ general inability to tactically allocate active funds seems likely to translate to an inability to tactically allocate etfs dalbar data supports our contention in the second bullet the “typical investor” has performed very poorly over the past  years see chart  the “typical investor” will likely be similarly unsuccessful when tactically picking etfs as they have been when picking mutual funds most investors tend to buy high and sell low why would that behavior be any different when they invest in etfs source richard bernstein advisors llc bloomberg msci standard  poor’s russellhfri bofa merrill lynch dalbar fhfa frb ftse total returns in usd average investor returns are represented by dalbar’s investor returns which represent the change in total mutual fund assets after excluding sales redemptions and exchanges fees play a major role in performance a  sec report httpswwwsecgovinvestoralertsibfeesexpensespdf outlines the effects that manager fees can have on longterm performance the report demonstrates that even small increases in manager fees can have a significant detrimental effect on wealth building pactive® strategies are relatively low fee strategies largely because there is no need to support a substantial analyst infrastructure necessary to research hundreds if not thousands of individual companies we feel the potential improvement in performance versus the dalbar performance history would more than compensate for the strategies’ relatively low fees in addition pactive® portfolios are transparent and liquid the trend in many areas of investment management has been toward higher fees less transparency and investor illiquidity pactive® seems to push back on those trends pactive® investing’s bright future pactive® investing seems to have a very bright future for the following reasons it is a unique combination of active and passive management ie the active management of passive investments it is tactical and can take advantage of significant changes in asset class leadership it is relatively low fee active management it is transparent and liquid there is a skill involved to allocating etfs history suggests that most investors are quite poor at asset allocation and equity allocation index descriptions the following descriptions while believed to be accurate are in some cases abbreviated versions of more detailed or comprehensive definitions
