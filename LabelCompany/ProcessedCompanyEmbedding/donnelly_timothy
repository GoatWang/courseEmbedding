service to consumers by tim donnelly tim donnelly is a freelance writer and managing editor of brokelyncom his work has appeared in billboard the atlantic thought catalog and the new york post timdonnelly inccom contributortimdonnelly  comments credit getty in a famous video clip from penn and tellers showtime hidden camera show diners are lured to an upscale restaurant branded as the worlds first boutique vendor of bottled water a water steward presents each table with a menu discussing the finer qualities of water purportedly shipped in from mountains and streams all over the world some of which cost as much as  a bottle of course the joke is on the customers because all the water actually came from the garden hose out back but the message was clear people are willing to pay more for a product if they think it gives them a truly special or significant value—and if you present it to them in just the right way your company is probably selling a stuff thats a lot more valuable than fanciedup hose water selling on value not price involves a balance of confidence personal rapport and doing your homework and its become more difficult as technology gives consumers greater access to price information and competitors weve talked with veterans of selling their value and they share some tips on how to make your products stand out in a lowcost world choose your targets wisely new companies often make one fatal mistake that forces them to compromise on price says barry farber a business consultant who has worked with american airlines att and bmw and author of more than  books on sales companies dont narrow their target market and dont understand their products likely arent for everyone farber says to do this by researching the potential client to see if they are a good candidate to meet your price needs this saves you from wasting time talking to people who only want the cheapest deal some sales people they just make sure the prospect is breathing and then they dump all this info on them he says thats not a good return on your investment of your time sales reps that dont have that kind of aggressive focus if they lose the deal their month is dead their year is dead nat kausik ceo of trubates an online marketplace for adjustable local deals says his company knows that many consumers are familiar with the nature of valuebased pricing especially after dealing with fluctuating airplane fares the right customers will be receptive to hearing why they should pay more for a certain product over another thats why his site lets users review an offer after they redeem it and makes the review available to other users consumers theyre very sophisticated he says they understand how to explore price for value about onethird of consumers are purely hung up on price while the other twothirds are open to at least hearing your argument says tom reilly an author and valuebased shopping expert innovators and early adopters are more likely to shell out the extra money he says be crystal clear whom the market segment is that youre designing for he says dig deeper how to narrow your target market leverage your strengths and experience once youre in the sales meeting with a potential client you had better be ready to stiffen your backbone and wield the full weight of your companys strengths this comes largely from sales skills but you can prepare your team by educating them on how your company stands out  its almost embarrassing at times the way people dont understand all the ways they bring value reilly says you should also be telling the potential client or customers about the history of the company which helps build confidence in the product build up your success stories by documenting testimonials from past successes and showing them off to future opportunities be able to successfully use your customers as your sales people farber says orwak a company that supplies waste compactors baling systems and other recycling equipment emphasizes its value thanks to its transcontinental reach based in europe the company has seen recycling grow leaps and bounds ahead of the united states over the past  years its sales team pitches its products as a way to help companies stay ahead of the recycling curve we try to sell it as hey weve been there done that lets look at europe thats the future of america says mark lanning orwaks national sales manager were going to give you a little peek at the future from our experience dig deeper secrets to getting good reviews online know that confidence is key when youre highlighting the value of a product over cheaper competitors you shouldnt be vacillating on price or negotiating reilly says to avoid words and phrases that suggest flexibility things like saying generally we charge or your price the time not to show a lack of conviction is when youre asking people for money he says drop the price without hesitation and without getting defensive he says it is the time however to mention the advantages you bring to market global sourcing logistic support programs and other things that go beyond the features of a single product or service reilly says you can be confident without dragging your competitors through the dirt farber says highlight why your products value is worth their consideration over lowerprice options the most critical thing an entrepreneur needs more than anything else is confidence he says if thats missing i dont care if you have a plan and all that stuff youre dead in the water you can lose your edge right away and selling value becomes  times more difficult dig deeper how to boost confidence and success emphasize your customer service the toughest job selling value to customers is getting them to picture the full depth and breadth of everything your company has to offer lanning says his company likes to talk about more than just the product as comparing balers can feel like just comparing one hunk of steel to another customers now expect a quick response time an ease of use and the feeling that you care about them its easier to paint the picture about service than a hard object he says farber advises people to foucs on personal touches and developing a rapport with the client by getting to know their needs and business background im a big believer of handwritten thank you notes he says often the customers who are obsessed with finding the lowest price turn into the biggest headaches he says but the customers that see your value understand youll be there to provide customer service make sure to keep providing good service throughout the lifespan of the customer which will let you pile up those customer testimonials you can use to show future clients why you provide the right value value is always long term reilly says price is short term dig deeper how to deliver great customer service the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those of inccom

week columbia associate professor timothy donnelly won the kingsley tufts poetry award one of the most prestigious prizes awarded to contemporary poets not only does the award identify donnelly as a rising star in the world of contemporary poetry but also bestows him with  an enormous sum for a midcareer poet in today’s market donnelly comments”this prize will give my family and me a measure of financial stability that would otherwise have taken a decade or more to achieve” the award recognizes his most recent work the cloud corporation for which the new yorker somewhat obliquely called donnelly “an acrobatic formalist albeit one on fastforward” this semester donnelly teaches a senior poetry workshop for undergraduates and a poetry thesis workshop school of the arts full press release after the jump… columbia university school of the arts writing faculty timothy donnelly receives kingsley tufts poetry award   new york february  —columbia university school of the arts is pleased to announce that timothy donnelly associate professor of writing has won the  kingsley tufts poetry award for his book the cloud corporation wave picador the annual award offered through the claremont graduate university is one of the most prestigious prizes a contemporary poet can receive “i am thrilled that timothy donnelly has won the kingsley tufts award” said carol becker dean of school of the arts “not only is timothy a beloved professor who has made monumental contributions to our writing program but as many have expressed he is one of the great poets of his generation” for  years now the kingsley tufts award has supported and honored midcareer poets including previous recipients da powell henri cole matthea harvey and yusef komunyakaa “i’m among the many people in this country who have had to go into significant debt just to get by” donnelly said of the seven difficult and sleepdeprived years he spent writing the cloud corporation all the anxiety in the book about the economy and the struggle to make ends meet isn’t just for effect—it’s all very personal this prize will give my family and me a measure of financial stability that would otherwise have taken a decade or more to achieve but as true as all that is it’s the honor of having had the cloud corporation chosen for this distinction that i really can’t wrap my head around” the cloud corporation is timothy donnelly’s second book his first twentyseven props for a production of eine lebenszeit was published by grove press in  his poems have been widely anthologized and translated appearing in such periodicals as a public space fence harper’s the iowa review jubilat lana turner the nation the new republic and the paris review this spring he is the theodore h holmes ’ and bernice holmes visiting associate professor at princeton university’s program in creative writing and lewis center for the arts he has been poetry editor of boston review since  he lives in brooklyn with his wife and two daughters the kingsley tufts award was established by kate tufts to honor the memory of her husband who worked as an executive and wrote poetry as his avocation kate and kingsley tufts were lifelong poetry lovers and often spoke of creating such a prize the award is presented for work by a poet who is past the very beginning but has not yet reached the pinnacle of his or her career “we hope these awards will give a crucial injection of encouragement to the poets of america” said linda gregerson chair of the judging panel “we expect of these poets thrilling work in the years to come”   the gaze

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
