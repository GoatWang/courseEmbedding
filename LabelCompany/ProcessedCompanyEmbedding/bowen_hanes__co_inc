fund one of the bestperforming public pensions in us view more fortune magazine the market beater from atlanta   jay bowen has established a stunning record by identifying longterm global trends and finding stocks that will benefit from them read more investment style  philosophy broad global trend analysis our topdown approach is rooted in the belief that the analysis of various global trends is vital when allocating funds to financial assets thus we begin with a broad analysis of global macroeconomic political and technological trends with our objective being to ascertain how these trends will impact the financial markets industry analysis it is only after answering these broad questions that we begin our industry analysis our topdown approach leads us to emphasize those sectors that we feel have the most potential in terms of growing their revenues and earnings not only in the us but in virtually every region in the world particular emphasis is given to those industries and companies that have a strategic and international business plan that focuses on those countries that display economic vibrancy including currency stability rising real incomes and improving living standards company analysis while certainly not the least important examining the individual company is the last component of our analysis we use a variety of proprietary valuation techniques to assess whether a company warrants investment consideration read more continued with this type of approach we are both growth and value managers rigid analysis of economic political and technological trends leads us to the industries that we feel have the most growth potential we then look for companies that we think represent the best value within those industries this means that we are going to be overweighted in certain industries and underweighted in others in many instances clients rely on bowen hanes to manage their funds in a balanced fashion to include both stocks and bonds when employing such an approach equities are relied upon for capital appreciation while fixed income securities are used for stability and incomefixed income the strategy for fixed income places a major emphasis on the following interest rate anticipation  commitments to securities are made when value is perceived from both a price and yield standpoint preservation of capital  quality and safety are of paramount importance when selecting bonds thus we emphasize investment grade securities when making commitments buy and hold strategy  the objective is to provide both income and stability as opposed to seeking
