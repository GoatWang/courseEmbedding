going long or short the opinions takes up to  years worth of historical data and runs these prices through thirteen different technical indicators after each calculation the program assigns a buy sell or hold value for each study depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study for example if the price is above the moving average of the stock then this is generally considered an upward trend or a buy note a security needs to have at least  active trading days in order to generate an opinion reading calculations the short medium and long term indicators are grouped together and calculated separately for their groups the overall indicator is a composite of all  studies listed on the page a buy is assigned  point a sell is assigned  point a hold is assigned  points the indicator value is determined by adding up the totals for the different groups and dividing this sum by the number of studies in the group the indicator is expressed in terms of a percentage if the total is greater than zero then this is a buy if the total is zero then this is a hold if the total is less than zero then this is a sell to keep the results in a more logical format we factor the overall opinion by  to keep the end result in multiples of  percentage points with the exception of a  buy or sell this is why the opinion indicators will be displayed as      and  for example rather the exact percentage value opinions are updated every ten minutes throughout the day using delayed data from the exchangessupport and resistance this section shows a snapshot view of
