structured nanopost array napa pillars for dependable ms results energy from the uv laser source on maldi systems is absorbed by the redichips napa pillars and is transferred to the sample by resonanceeffect the nanoposts on the redichip surface are highly organized and offer exceptional reproducibility in each analysis napa pillar dimensions are optimized for maximum efficiency in energy transfer resulting in enhanced sample ionization in a matrixfree environmentin traditional matrix assisted laser desorption ionization maldi mass spec experiments a chemical matrix is necessary to facilitate molecular ionization for subsequent analysis maldims has become a standard technique for a variety of analytical applications but it is not ideal for small molecule identification due to signal impedance from the matrix the redichip enables small molecule quantitation because of the unique matrixfree design of the target platenanopost dimensions have been optimized for enhanced ion production via resonanceeffect upon interaction of the uv laser with the nanostructures laser light confinement effects field enhancements high heating rates prolonged interaction times promote sample ionization in the nanostructures         resource center visit our resource center to learn more about our technologies and capabilities learn more rc protea biosciences  pineview drive suite

because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using these parameters investors have seen  annual returns on average
