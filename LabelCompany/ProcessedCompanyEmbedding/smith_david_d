jersey for the past two years during the th and th centuries several major theorists put forth ideas that would influence how governments handled economic matters this lesson will discuss the major ideas and influential theories of adam smith david ricardo and thomas malthus introductionduring the th and th centuries several major writers began commenting on the economy these individuals attempted to uncover theories which could be applied to markets in order to promote a better society among the most influential theorists of the time were adam smith david ricardo and thomas malthus in this lesson well discuss the major theories of these three economists with special attention to how their ideas influenced the field of economics adam smithadam smith is known as the father of modern economics born in scotland in  he embarked on an academic career at the age of  educated primarily in european literature he was awarded a position as chair of logic in  and then chair of moral philosophy the following year at glasgow university in  smith became the tutor of the young duke of buccleuch this career change had lasting effects on smiths philosophy while he traveled with the duke he visited places like switzerland and france and became aware of the ideas of thinkers such as voltaire rousseau quesnay and turgot importantly his employment with the duke gave him a lifelong pension this granted him the freedom to retire and write his work theory of moral sentiments which was published in  he continued to write afterwards and produced the wealth of nations in  the philosophy he advocated in these works continues to influence economic thought today according to smith people have a capacity for reasonable judgment that is often underestimated and should not allow politicians or philosophers to impose unreasonable government regulations on them he was an advocate of laissezfaire thinking which was a policy of minimal government intervention in the economy according to smith free markets allowed the natural laws of supply and demand to function properly smith remained a lifelong bachelor and died in scotland in  david ricardoanother influential economist was david ricardo born in london on april   he was the third of  children at the age of  he began working with his father who was a successful stock broker ricardo worked with his father until  during that year ricardo married priscilla anne wilkinson a quaker later he converted from judaism to christianity a move that greatly angered his parents this forced ricardo to leave his fathers business and start his own as a broker he was able to save money to retire at the age of  with his first career over he looked to politics for his next challenge ricardo read adam smiths book wealth of nations in  he was so intrigued by the concepts in smiths work that he began studying economics himself in  he produced his first publication the high price of bullion a proof of the depreciation of bank notes which argued for the use of metallic currency his methods of analyzing market forces by using deduction and mathematics still influence economics today he also believed like smith that economies functioned best when they were left alone by governments ricardo was an early advocate of free trade one of his most influential theories was comparative advantage which was the idea that nations should focus on industries where they could easily compete in the market and only trade with other countries to gain products not available nationally by this theory each nation could profit from specializing in certain industries ricardo died in  at the age of  thomas malthusreverend thomas malthus was born on february   in england he has had an enduring effect on economics and even the work of charles darwin in his autobiography darwin cited malthus essay on the principle of population as inspiration for his theory of natural selection in this work malthus wrote that man if left unchecked was capable of producing far more offspring than the world resources could handle his conclusion was that if offspring were not regulated eventually famine would become a global problem using these ideas darwin came to the conclusion that offspring with certain qualities would be better equipped to survive than others in  darwin wrote in october  that is fifteen months after i had begun my systematic inquiry i happened to read for amusement malthus on population and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long continued observation of the habits of animals and plants it at once struck me that under these circumstances favorable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavorable ones to be destroyed × unlock

courses math history english actsat science business psychology ap malthus continued to influence economics with his theory of wages which stated that earnings would drop to the minimum amount necessary to maintain a workers basic needs because high wages would cause a spike in population his premise that population growth would cause worldwide starvation became known as the malthusian catastrophe his views became controversial because they opposed the popular th century attitude that european society could improve and move towards perfection his population fears were based on the technology of his day however increases in food production changes in storage and industrial technology all helped to support a growing world population without the mass famine predicted by malthus he died on december rd  lesson summaryas economists writing in the th and th centuries adam smith david ricardo and thomas malthus wrote about theories which would continue to influence economic theory in modern times among the ideas advocated by adam smith was a policy of minimal government intervention in economic matters or laissezfaire thinking smith was also a staunch supporter of free markets which allowed the natural laws of supply and demand to function properly smith became an influence for david ricardo who read his work wealth of nations before embarking on his own economic studies ricardo was also a proponent of laissezfaire economics one of his most enduring legacies was his support of utilizing metallic money to replace paper bank notes thomas malthus was most noted for his assertion that the worlds population needed to be regulated he believed that since the world contained limited resources continued population growth would ultimately lead to global starvation while this theory has been seen as unfounded his focus on population studies helped pave the way for modern studies in their own ways these economists paved the way for modern studies of free markets

country has a fixed stock of resourcesc free trade changes the efficiency with which a country uses its resourcesd differences in the prices of resources in different countries existbthe simple model of comparative advantage used in the text is based on assuming away a the effects of trade on income distribution within a countryb constant returns to scalec that all resources can move freely from

circumstances the theory of comparative advantage predicts that a rich country might actually be worse off by switching to a free trade regime with a poor nation a raymond vernonb andrew warnerc paul samuelsond jeffery sachscin comparative advantage the assumption is that resources can move freely from production of one good to another why is this assumption unrealistic a the process of shifting resources from one good to another eliminates human sufferingb the benefit of free trade is much lesser compared to the cost of shifting resourcesc the process of moving resources causes friction and human sufferingd there are regulations that prohibit such movementcthe units of resources required to produce a good are assumed to remain unchanged no matter where one is on a countrys production possibility frontier this is known as a zerosum gameb positivesum gamec constant returns to specializationd diminishing returns to specializationcdiminishing returns to specialization occurs when a natural resources begin to run out owing to pollutionb more units of resources are required to produce each additional unitc the cost of producing goods reduces substantially with increase in number of goods producedd the quality of resources comes down as a result of producing more goodsbit is more realistic to assume diminishing returns to specialization when evaluating the theory of comparative advantage this is because a there exist differences in the prices of resources in different countriesb resources can move freely from the production of one good to another within a countryc not all resources are of the same qualityd different goods use resources in the same proportionscthe comparative advantage theory is considered to have ignored which of the following statements a constant returns to specialization implies a concave production possibility frontierb constant returns to specialization suggests that the gains from specialization are likely to be exhausted before specialization is completec it is feasible for a country to specialize to a point where the resulting gains from trade are outweighed by diminishing returnsd different goods use different resources in different proportionsddynamic gains in both the stock of a countrys resources and the efficiency with which resources are utilized will a cause the countrys ppf to be in a bellshaped curveb enable the country to produce more goods than it did before the introduction of free tradec cause a countrys ppf to shift inwardd enable the country to achieve constant returns to specializationbwhat was samuelsons criticism of free trade a he argued that dynamic gains lead to a universally beneficial outcome for all countriesb he argued that offshoring service jobs that were traditionally mobile will increase the market clearing wage ratec he argued that free trade has historically been beneficial only to third world countriesd a rich country importing cheap goods from a poor country may not make up for the wage losses in the rich countrydaccording to samuelson the ability to offshore service jobs that traditionally were not internationally mobile coupled with rapid advances in communications technology and the productivity of foreign labor due to better education have an effect on middleclass wages in the united states that can be similar to a mass inward migration into the united statesb improvement in the standard of living in the united statesc better employability of united states labord a substantial hike in the market clearing wage rateaone of the rebuttals of samuelsons critique of the free trade model is that a the united states ability to achieve constant returns to specialization is unparalleledb the strict immigration policies of the united states help insulate the economy from inward migrationc introducing trade barriers may in fact be beneficial for the united states to some extentd developing nations are unlikely to upgrade the skill level of their workforce rapidly enoughd and  created a measure of how open to international trade an economy was and then looked at the relationship between openness and economic growth for a sample of more than  countries from  to  a ricardo smithb warner sachsc porter vernond samuelson ohlinbin general economic studies on the relationship between trade and economic growth suggest that a countries open to international trade display higher growth rates than those that close their economies to tradeb comparative advantage theory does not hold much relevance in the modern world of international trade and open economiesc modern economic trends tend to be influenced more by the absolute advantage theory than the comparative advantage theoryd with the onset of free trade rich countries are showing better dynamic gains in the efficiency with which resources are usedaaccording to the heckscherohlin theory the pattern of international trade is determined by differences in a labor productivityb efficiencyc factor endowmentsd management practicescthe united states has an abundance of arable land but faces a shortage of lowcost labor in contrast china excels in the production of laborintensive goods such as footwear and textiles according to the heckscherohlin theory a united states will import textiles and footwear from china and export agricultural goodsb china will invest more than united states in the production of agricultural goods to exploit its population advantagec united states and china will import agricultural goods and textiles respectively

because a it makes fewer simplifying assumptionsb it predicts realworld international trade patterns with greater accuracyc ricardos theory is less accurate due to the leontief paradoxd ricardos theory is too complicated to be applied to realworld scenariosaus exports were less capitalintensive than us imports despite the relative abundance of capital in the country this phenomenon runs contrary to what the heckscherohlin theory would predict and is termed the  paradox a zenob leontiefc russelld simpsonbwhat is a possible explanation for the leontief paradox a us imports goods that heavily use skilled labor and innovative entrepreneurshipb us has a special advantage in producing new products made with innovative technologiesc us exports heavy manufacturing products that use large amounts of capitald us has a strong absolute advantage over all other foreign nations because of its advantageous factor endowmentsbone of the drawbacks of the heckscherohlin theory even though it makes sound theoretical sense is that a it does not explain the differences in national factor endowmentsb it argues that comparative advantage arises from differences in the countries labor productivityc it lacks common sense appeald it is a relatively poor predictor of realworld international trade patternsdone of the key assumptions of the heckscherohlin theory is that a technologies
