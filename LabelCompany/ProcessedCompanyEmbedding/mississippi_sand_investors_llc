hydrosizer positioned for frac sand explosion details published tuesday  august   mclanahan corp has been an equipment manufacturer for more than  years so it’s no surprise to find them on the cutting edge of constructionmaterials trends the company is a leading supplier in the design and supply of wetprocessing plants for producing “frac sand” which is gaining popularity among the nation’s producers frac sand andor proppant consists of naturally round unconsolidated highsilica sands typically within the size range of  and  mesh production of this sand involves washing scrubbing classifying dewatering drying screening and packaging and shipping the increased demand for oil and natural gas has driven oil and gas companies to increase production by both stimulating older wells and drilling new wells one important method for maximizing the production of each well is through the process of hydraulic fracturing during which frac sand is combined with a viscous gel and forced down the wells at high pressure to prop open the fractures millions of dollars are being spent on the production of this sand the reason is that the average construction sand used in concrete and asphalt sells for around  per ton frac sand sells for  to  per ton “for most wetprocessing equipment companies frac sand production has been the one saving grace in a tough couple of years due to the comparatively high price of frac sand which can be  times that of some construction sands” said john best general manager aggregates processing division for mclanahan corp “many of the major companies are looking to see if their resources are viable and investors outside the industry are falling over themselves to get new plants into production to ride the oilgas exploration and production wave” when extremely precise classification is needed to separate granular material by size the mclanahan hydrosizer is comparable to screening but at the fraction of the footprint and cost for specific gravity separation the hydrosizer or the fb litesout classifier offers the best most efficient and costeffective solution according to the company features include extremely sharp high efficiency size classification between  and  micron effective separation of minerals of different specific gravity low operating cost rapid payback on investment producer focusmississippi sand llc is one producer
