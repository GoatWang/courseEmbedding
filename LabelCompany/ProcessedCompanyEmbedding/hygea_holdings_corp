common stock the healthcare services industry tends to be fragmented and dynamic consisting of specialized and ancillary services firms that operate mainly on a regional basis such as generalist management companies information systems vending firms that offer services ranging from simple emrpms packages to complex billing and management systems health maintenance organizations and managed service organizations due to the healthcare services market having a strong regional bias many competitors in one location may not be operating in other areas management believes that the fragmented competition allows the company the opportunity to expand into new markets rapidly via targeted acquisitions the industry in which hygea operates has no institutional provider organizations the hygea integrated practice model combines three distinct business verticals the first business vertical is the medicare advantage designated clinic system that only accepts medicare advantage patients with significant presence maintained by leon medical centers miami dade county mcci florida statewide pasteur medical centers miami date county and southeastern integrated medical simed centers ocala and jacksonville the second business vertical is the commercial market and feeforservice medicare which is best represented in florida by cleveland clinic florida statewide mayo clinic florida statewide and southeastern integrated medical north florida the third business vertical is comprised of small group practices that will take a combination of both feeforservice and medicare advantage patients these practices are usually not large enough to sustain all the components of the hygea integrated model hygea combines all of the business verticals and sees itself as payor neutral accepting clients irrespective of whether they are commercial cash or medicare advantagemedicare feeforservice we do not believe ancillary service firms are not in competition with hygea as they do not drive or attract patients but are more of recipient of referrals from these three business verticals in the state of florida the northern part of the state is driven by a feeforservice practice model while the southern part of the state has a much higher incident of managed care delivery model company description we are the principal shareholder of hygea health owning  of hygea health hygea health has two principal areas of operations the first is a network of multidisciplinary integrated medical group practices integrated group with a primary care physician pcp focus the integrated group owns a series of subsidiaries that provide industry related services and which support the integrated group practice business model the second focus is palm medical network llc palm medical network an independent physician network under palm medical network we have a series of medical service organizations msos that have entered at risk contracts with medicare advantage health maintenance organizations hmos throughout florida under the integrated group we manage own and are acquiring physician practices that we incorporate into integrated multidisciplinary group practices the principal focus is the acquisition of primary care physicians which includes family practice internal medicine clinical cardiology and other primary care concentrated disciplines we began implementation of our provider

emrpms into additional companyowned and other physician practice groups throughout the us the development of our integrated group and our palm medical network is subject to a number of risks uncertainties and obstacles these risks include our inability to raise needed financing to maintain or grow our operations the erosion of our revenue stream as a result of competition increased expenses resulting from an increased regulatory atmosphere the failure or delay of third party payors to provide reimbursement for our services healthcare claims exceeding our reserves and our
