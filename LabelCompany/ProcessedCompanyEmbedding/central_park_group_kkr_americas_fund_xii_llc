alternativeassets lineup kkrs  acquisition of girish reddys fundofhedgefunds firm prisma was a move in the right direction two keys to its success ties to goldman sachs and the promise of independence by jan alexander kkr prisma cofounder and ceo girish reddy photograph by dorothy hong page  of  henry kravis knows a thing or two about acquisitions but the deal that kkr  co engineered in october  promised to be particularly delicate the buyer was an established company seeking new revenue sources the targets capital came from investors nervous about changing anything the principals of both companies had to see eye to eye if the targets executives walked because the buyer wanted to impose its own ideas the transaction might fail so although kravis his longtime partner george roberts and other kkr executives might normally advise an acquirer to cut costs eliminate jobs and rethink the business in this case they had to tread carefully the reason the buyer was kkr and the target new york fundofhedgefunds firm prisma capital partners was kkrs first acquisition for itself  that is not as a participant in a buyout today kravis can say its been a great marriage despite the long and anxious courtship it is a marriage however in which the two parties live apart and operate autonomously that was part of the deal kravis and his kkr colleagues work out of the firms elegant headquarters at  west th street just off fifth avenue and a short stroll from central park the ceo of whats now called kkr prisma girish reddy runs his firm from offices at one penn plaza a new building that is one of the few examples of gentrification in a shabby if bustling part of midtown near penn station and madison square garden whereas kravis has hung his own art collection at kkr featuring work by cindy sherman and edward ruscha reddys prisma displays pieces by emerging artists including almostlargeaslife photos of mongolia by john delaney a former master printer for richard avedon reddy cofounded prisma ten years ago with two former colleagues from goldman sachs group gavyn davies and thomas healey who remain advisers to the firm kkr prisma is a sizable business now with  billion in assets  no  on the fund of funds  institutional investors alphas ranking of the worlds largest fundofhedgefund firms but kkr expects much more funds of funds gained prominence in the s mostly for highnetworth individuals and smaller institutions that wanted to invest in hedge funds a fund of funds allocates its capital to multiple hedge funds offering clients less risk than in betting on a few singlefund managers and allowing investments in otherwise inaccessible funds when reddy and his partners started prisma in  they thought the future lay with institutional clients and customized portfolios they were right the largest private equity firms have long been attracted to hedge funds blackstone group  kkrs biggest rival  started a fund of hedge funds with partner capital in   years before the firms public offering then expanded it under j tomilson hill a former lehman brothers holdings investment banker and executive hill is now ceo of blackstone alternative asset management the largest provider of funds of hedge funds in the world with  billion in assets today all the publicly listed private equity firms  apollo global management blackstone carlyle group fortress investment group kkr oaktree capital management  have diversified into other alternative assets including hedge funds goldman sachs senior analyst marc irizarry says total assets in publicly traded alternativeasset managers have doubled from  billion in  to  billion in  while capital from nonprivateequity businesses has grown from  percent to almost  percent kkr remains more dependent on buyouts than its publicly traded peers  percent of its  billion in assets comes from private equity these firms pursued diversification for a variety of reasons there are natural limits in private equity so to maintain growth these firms seek new asset classes as private equity matures firms focus on leveraging their brands younger managers clamor to expand to build their careers while share prices get a boost from assets that run countercyclically to private equity and most buyout firms want to offer investors more products in some cases broadening offerings into liquid alternatives in hopes of cracking the retail investor market but getting hedge funds right isnt easy in june kkr liquidated its kkr equities strategies fund a hedge fund it had formed in  with a team from goldman sachs proprietary trading desk the fund had  million in assets sources at kkr say it never achieved the scale they hoped for and that the firm wants to concentrate on prisma its credit hedge funds and seeding new hedge funds in  kkr wound down a credit hedge fund the kkr strategic capital fund after assets fell from  billion in  to a little more than  million hurt like many funds at the time by investor redemptions kkr still runs about  million in two credit strategies and owns a  percent stake in nephila capital a  billion reinsurance hedge fund based in bermuda and it owns  percent of prisma a fund of hedge funds can fit well into an alternativeasset structure to some extent a fund of funds removes a firms vulnerability to the performance of an individual fund manager because clients in funds of funds are generally smaller or less sophisticated institutions than those in private equity a firm can expand its base without the risk of scaring off core investors if things dont work out certainly a fund of funds can go awry apollo global management bought a stake in a fund of hedge funds lighthouse investment partners in december  but reportedly is now trying to cash out after disappointing performance and disagreements over strategy small wonder that kkr took its time over the prisma acquisition  about two years a fund of hedge funds is a complicated business that must cope with new complexities when it becomes part of a large more diversified alternativeasset firm throughout the acquisition process both kkr which has a long history of buying out hundreds of companies of all kinds and prisma which specializes in carefully designing and constructing portfolios of hedge funds clearly understood the special nature of the relationship now after two years the honeymoon and the adjustment period are both over and the story of prisma and kkr has truly begun prisma ceo reddy speaks of portfolios as precision instruments you should test the risk factors before you put the pieces together he says when you add a new manager how does his or her risk complement other managers you should test the portfolio at that stage not after you make a  percent allocation such exactitude is not accidental reddy studied engineering before he considered a finance career now  he was born and raised in hyderabad india and earned a bs in electrical engineering at the prestigious indian institute of technology madras he came to the us to work on a graduate degree in engineering at cornell university cornell had just started a threeyear engineering and mba program which reddy joined he says the program opened up a new view of the world one of my favorite courses was in derivatives primarily focused on options and futures he says at the time derivatives and investment management were a big focus at cornell with two leading professors in the area andrew rudd and robert jarrow so it was a natural fit for me and i ended up doing my mba in finance rudd had cofounded analytic research firm barra now msci barra and jarrow developed a number of derivatives models and techniques in  reddy went to work for goldman sachs in london where he eventually coheaded the equity derivatives group he became a partner six years later davies was in the london office too as chief economist reddy considered the zimbabweborn cambridge universityeducated davies a thoughtful policy guy healey was a partner in goldmans new york office where he was chairman of the pension services group and led institutional marketing he saw that pension managers were starting to consider alternative assets pension funds had large pools of capital and interesting investment ideas and we perceived that there would be a growing interest in hedge funds says healey who served as assistant secretary of the treasury for domestic finance under ronald reagan the trio were at goldman when the bank went public in  a move that gave partners a share of the ipo profits but reportedly with a threeyear lockup reddy elected to leave in  at the age of  he declined to comment on any financial incentives but says i thought it was time to try something more entrepreneurial he moved with his family to summit new jersey and began to explore new ventures he became a director at his former professors firm barra in  msci acquired the firm the next year healey and davies also left goldman all of us had run our course at goldman and we all left within a six to month period for different reasons says healey who began teaching at harvard business school and participating in various investment partnerships davies who had been interested in the economics of the media industry became chairman of the bbc in  he brought in ideas for funding and adapting to the web satellite and other changing media technologies but his tenure ended under a cloud in january  after a uk judicial inquiry criticized the bbc for what even the
