more about argentina and other countries in our daily postcard eletter simply enter your email address below to sign up for these free postcards and well also send you a free report  what nobody will tell you about argentina your email address excellent argentina real estate opportunities are available throughout the country the architecture defining properties in argentina is eclectic older buildings in buenos aires that would be well at home in any european city sit alongside unappealing highrises built in the ’s ’s and ’s…and here and there newer and less offensive modern structures share the landscape the older apartments in buenos aires are much bigger than their european counterparts making the real estate in argentina much more comfortable than say the typical european apartment for instance the typical apartment in buenos aires is approximately  square feet with three bedrooms two bathrooms a large kitchen sitting room dining room and maids’ quarters magnificent apartment properties most larger apartments in argentina have one or two bedrooms and maids’ quarters plus a back entrance with separate stairs and elevator for the maids’ use the perfoot cost of these apartments is onethird to onetenth that of a similar property in europe a squarefoot apartment for example in one of these argentine properties of character will cost you about  all indications are that an investment in an apartment in buenos aires is a good one if you are interested in making an investment in argentina real estate here you have two options you can buy something small…something that would be considered a starter home for a single person or a couple or you can buy a larger unit–a “classic” apartment in one of the better neighborhoods a smaller apartment would make a good longterm rental on the local market returning about  net of everything including the rental management fee with minimal hassle the only potential hassle would be an eviction however the property laws in argentina related to eviction of a tenant are similar to those in the united states and the eviction process isn’t overly difficult there are steps to follow but it’s nothing like europe for example where even the most deadbeat of tenants can be all but impossible to evict different areas of buenos aires in which to buy real estate in palermo a neighborhood in buenos aires that attracts lots of expats real estate prices have fallen less than in other parts of the city but they’re still very reasonable end houses in the northern suburbs which are where expats with families tend to navigate are selling for up to  less than before the currency devaluation in addition to apartments in the capital there is also an attractive real estate market right now for houses in the buenos aires suburbs to the north here you will find quaint englishstyle houses built in the s and modern angular houses of more than  square feet with fourcar garages these are highervalue investments and like apartment properties in buenos aires offer long but probably not shortterm rental potential…plus the promise of impressive appreciation in the coming years if you are particularly interested in getting into the rental business with your argentina real estate purchase you might want to consider one of the northern suburb’s gated communities to either buy a lot and build a home or buy an existing home returns in the best gated communities for longterm rentals are currently about  per year overall houses in the northern suburbs rent well on the corporate expat market especially to families with schoolaged children there is an englishlanguage school nearby and the feel is more like the north shore of chicago than the third world there are shops restaurants parks and there’s even a commuter train to the city the cost per square foot for the readytomoveinto houses ranges from  to  this is where the wealthy argentines live so the houses are big in other words although the persquarefoot cost is low the total cost is not entirely insignificant small houses here are around  square feet and are selling for  and up every house has maids’ quarters most have back staircases for maids swimming pools and parrillas y quinchos–outdoor covered eating areas and brick barbecues the real estate in these suburbs undoubtedly has great potential for longterm appreciation longerterm than the two to three years you might expect for apartments in the city these are grand houses built with “real” materials–granite for the countertops hardwoods for the floors and windows and brick for the exteriors houses of this standard in a major us city would go for at least four times what they are currently listed for in buenos aires the argentine real estate market beyond buenos aires patagonia is a brand in itself including mendoza and its wonderful wine region and bariloche and the lake region including san martin de los andes mendoza concentrates the best regions for wineries and vineyard properties with prices starting as low as  for a  to acre piece of real estate a garden city with stunning views of the andes mountains it has five trees for every resident
