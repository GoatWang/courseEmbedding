insights it should come as no surprise to anyone who has to buy gasoline heating oil natural gas or any other petroleum product—powershares db energy fund nysearcadbe which began trading on jan   has had a spectacular run as the etf approaches its month anniversary the fund’s nav return since inception is  including a  yeartodate gain through june  and a  jump in the last three months all better than  of energy etfs dbe invests directly in futures contracts exchangetraded instruments promising the delivery of oil at a predetermined price on a future date essentially the fund bets on the price of five energy commodities—brent crude oil heating oil light crude natural gas and rbob reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending gasoline the fund generates returns from fluctuations in the price of the commodities from interest on treasury bills used to collateralize the futures contracts and from rolling contract yields thanks to the powershares db optimum yield model prices for four of the five have been rising for several years and hovering at or near record highs for several months the key reason for dbe’s sparkling returns the fifth natural gas is also up sharply in recent months on monday for example brent crude was  more expensive than it was a year ago while rbob gas was  higher spot prices for henry hub natural gas—which make up just  of the fund’s base weighting compared to an equal  stake in each of the other four—were up  over the last year to  per million british thermal units the fund’s daily index weightings vary due to fluctuations in price and the index is rebalanced to the base weights annually during the first week or so of november while the mix makes dbe more diversified than powershares db oil fund nysearcadbo or the popular united states oil fund nysearcauso—which has taken in nearly  billion versus  million for dbe and  million for dbo—this fund is clearly not a diversified fund in fact dbe is not part of our powershares momentum tracker portfolio because we gain exposure to oil through the db commodity index tracking fund nysearcadbc which also tracks aluminum corn gold and wheat dbe has outgained dbc since we added the latter to the portfolio nov   to  but can that continue commodity investing is always risky and the long seemingly merciless runup in prices for the energy commodities that make up  of this fund’s assets only magnify that risk last fall cleve rueckert of tickersense noted that we were in the nd oilprice rally  or more in two decades after each prices declined by an average of  over an average period of four months such a drop would likely be devastating for shareholders of dbe and a host of other commodity and energy funds in monday’s commodities roundup the wall street journal noted “after rising  this year some observers wonder how much higher crude prices can go before prices cripple consumption” of course this rally may be different for one thing as rueckert pointed out the average rally lasted  days and this one is closer to  days now since oil closed at  in january  the us slowdown the weak us dollar interestrate cuts by the federal reserve and an influx of money into speculative energy and commodity investing along with a constant in the space—geopolitical issues—have all helped lift prices to the stratosphere crude futures hit another intraday record on monday nearing  per barrel before falling back on news of saudi arabia’s announcement that it will boost output on monday alone prices gained and then fell nearly  before closing down just  analysts are predicting anything from a  drop in oil prices to another big jump matthew simmons president of houston investment bank simmons  co international predicts oil will hit  to  per barrel over the next six months to five years as reported by the wall street journal the bottom line no one knows what’ll happen next though more and more experts are saying that  oil is realistic over the next six to  months while that would be good news for dbe shareholders it may come with potentially violent swings both up and down the news from saudi arabia caused dbe’s nav to drop  intraday on monday after opening  higher than friday’s close that’s a lot of movement even for investors with commodity funds as a niche play designed to diversify a portfolio for most that’s the only role this fund should play especially right now dbe may offer some protection in today’s stormy seas as a hedge against inflation and other market troubles but its outsized returns raise the question of whether it’s too
