fda determined that your firm manufactures the fortify unify assura including quadra implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators and the merlinhome monitor  under section h of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the act  usc § h these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or function of the body this inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section h of the act  usc § h in that the methods used in or the facilities or controls used for their manufacture packing storage or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice

commensurate with the significance and risk of the nonconformance further section  states the risk evaluation of nonconformances is based on three factors severity probability and detectability   by basing your firm’s risk evaluation on “confirmed” cases and not considering the potential for “unconfirmed” cases to have been shorts your firm underestimated the occurrence of the hazardous situation this delayed initiation of capa  titled lithium clusters shorts in m cells until december   and your firm continued to distribute devices containing this battery until october  the adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time your firm provided a summary of and implementation dates for several corrections corrective actions and systemic corrective actions however in your firm’s response you failed to provide evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections corrective actions and systemic corrective actions  b  section  of both your sjm corrective and preventive action capa sop b  revision d and sjm corrective and preventive action wi b  revision c defines your firm’s capa process and the supporting procedures and forms associated with activities performed within your firm’s capa process additionally figure  in your firm’s sjm corrective and preventive action wi b  revision c describes the capa risk assessment and resolution process that proceeds after a capa file is opened  your firm failed to follow its capa procedures when evaluating a third party report dated august   in that your firm released merlinhome cybersecurity risk assessment b  revision g an updated risk assessment and its corresponding corrective action merlinhome ex v pilot release on december   with full release on january   before approving the capa request for this issue capa titled crm product cybersecurity on february    your firm conducted a risk assessment and a corrective action outside of your capa system your firm did not confirm all required corrective and preventive actions were completed including a full root cause investigation and the identification of actions to correct and prevent recurrence of potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities as required by your capa procedures additionally your firm did not confirm that verification or validation activities for the corrective actions had been completed to ensure the corrective actions were effective and did not adversely affect the finished device we have reviewed your response and conclude that it is not adequate  your firm provided a summary of and implementation dates for several corrections and corrective actions however in your firm’s response you failed to consider systemic corrective actions and the necessary information to include evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections corrective actions and systemic corrective actions  c  your management review and medical advisory boards did not receive relevant and complete information concerning the premature battery depletion issue as required by section  your firm’s procedure quality management review sop b  revision r on november  and november   two separate presentations were provided for management review and to your mab for review concerning premature battery depletions the presentation to your firm’s mab included rates of occurrence of premature battery depletions caused by “confirmed” lithium cluster formations the presentation did not include information on the potential for “unconfirmed” cases to be shorts despite possessing evidence provided by your supplier regarding premature battery depletion caused by lithium bridges this resulted in significant underestimations of the probability of occurrence of the hazardous situation additionally both presentations stated there were no serious injury or death directly related to lithium cluster formations however the first related death to this issue occurred on b mdr your firm completed its returned device analysis related to this death on august   the analysis concluded the cause of premature battery depletion “could not be determined” despite evidence of lithium bridges provided by your supplier this death was not disclosed in these presentations for management or mab review  we have reviewed your response and conclude that it is not adequate your firm provided a summary of and implementation dates for several corrections and corrective actions however in your firm’s response you failed to consider systemic corrective actions and the necessary information to include evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections corrective actions and systemic corrective actions        failure to establish and maintain procedures to control product that does not conform to specified requirements as required by  cfr a   for example on october    your firm initiated a recall for your firm’s fortify unify and assura implantable cardioverter defibrillators icds and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators crtds due to premature battery depletion subsequently ten implantable cardiac defibrillators icds subject to this recall were shipped from your firm’s distribution centers to st jude us field representatives between october  and october   an additional seven icds also subject to this recall and in the control of st jude us field representatives were implanted into patients    the adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time  your firm provided a summary of and implementation dates for several corrections corrective actions and systemic corrective actions however in your firm’s response you failed to provide evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections corrective actions and systemic corrective actions        failure to ensure that design verification shall confirm that the design output meets the design input requirements as required by  cfr f for example your firm has a design input b  of “the remote monitoring device shall only open network ports to authorized interfaces” which is documented in merlinhome ex b software system requirements specification document b this is implemented as a design output in your firm’s merlinhome software requirements specification uploads b this design output was not fully verified during your firm’s design verification activities according to your firm’s testing procedures b final configuration test procedures b and final configuration test procedures document b  the requirement was only partially verified by testing that the network ports opened with an authorized interface   your testing procedures did not require full verification to ensure the network ports would not open with an unauthorized interface     the adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time your firm provided a summary of and implementation dates for several corrections corrective actions and systemic corrective actions however in your firm’s response you failed to provide evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections corrective actions and systemic corrective actions       failure to ensure that design validation shall include risk analysis where appropriate as required by  cfr g  for example  a  your firm failed to accurately incorporate the findings of a thirdparty assessment you commissioned dated april   into your firm’s updated cybersecurity risk assessments for your high voltage and peripheral devices specifically       your firm’s updated cybersecurity risk assessments b cybersecurity risk assessment b  revision a april   and merlinhome product security risk assessment b revision b may   failed to accurately incorporate the third party report’s findings into its security risk ratings causing your postmitigation risk estimations to be acceptable when according to the report several risks were not adequately controlled      the same report identified the hardcoded universal unlock code as an exploitable hazard for your firm’s high voltage devices  your firm’s global risk management procedure sop b  section  of revision t released november   and section  of revision x released november   requires your firm to assess if new hazards are introduced or previously identified hazardous situations are affected by risk control measures your firm identified the hardcoded universal unlock code as a risk control measure for emergent communication however you failed to identify this risk control also as a hazard  therefore you failed to properly estimate and evaluate the risk associated with the hardcoded universal lock code in the design of your high voltage devices  the adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time your firm provided a summary of and implementation dates for several corrections corrective actions and systemic corrective actions however in your firm’s response you failed to provide evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections corrective actions and systemic corrective actions b  section  of your firm’s global risk management procedure sop b  revision t outlines your firm’s risk management policy which states that “risk management shall be integrated into all product life cycle stages in order to assure early identification and timely mitigation of risks that could impact patient safety” your firm’s returned product analysis record for b  was completed by your firm on september   for a device that was explanted on july   due to premature battery depletion this analysis included evidence of lithium ion cluster formation however your firm failed to identify lithium clusters as a hazardous situation and a potential cause of premature battery depletion through its risk management process this process is used for batteries that are used in the unify fortify assura and quadra icds and crtds  we have reviewed your response and conclude that it is not adequate in your firm’s response you failed to provide a description and evidence of implementation for corrections and corrective actions to include consideration of systemic corrective actions you should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the fda without further notice these actions include but are not limited to seizure injunction and civil money penalties also federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of warning letters about devices so that they may take this information

firm has taken if your firm’s planned corrections andor corrective actions will occur over time please include a timetable for implementation of those activities if corrections andor corrective action cannot be completed within  business days state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all
