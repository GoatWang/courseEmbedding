seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»government properties income trust as sustainable as it getsjun  about government properties gov cashcentered creep dividend growth investing dividend investing longterm horizonsummarygovernment properties recently released their q figuresthe strongest advantage this reit has is its position as the us governments biggest landlordcombined with their other assets this seems a safe lucrative investmenta business that is stable provides steady income and is likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future is one any income investor would want in their portfolio  and it is my opinion that government properties income trust nysegov is such a business on april  government properties income trust released their q figures with q ffo of  missing estimates by  and revenues of  million beating estimates by  million the earnings miss was addressed the april  conference call by president and coo david blackman who asserted that it was negatively impacted by our noncash charge at sir due to a tenant bankruptcy by sir blackman was referring to select income reit nysesir a firm in which government properties has a  stake nonetheless blackman also stated that our operating results remained stable in light of this report it is worth taking a look at government properties as a prospective investment government properties income trust is a reit that focuses the bulk of its property portfolio on government tenants indeed they hold the distinction of being the us governments biggest landlord offering  properties containing  million square feet across  states and in washington dc to federal and state government departments and agencies this fact alone makes government properties an attractive investment the us government is as reliable a tenant as it gets the likelihood of the federal government defaulting on rental payments is extremely unlikely the sheer diversity of us government agencies making use of government properties makes plain just how dependent the government is on this reit for its office space agency rentable square feet  of rentable square feet  of annualized rental income citizenship and immigration services

federal governments rent of the office space provided by government properties generates  of the reits annual income in addition to this the reit also gets rental income from state government departments and agencies in states such as california georgia massachusetts new york and virginia it also profits from its  stake in select income reit the strength of the position that government properties enjoys can be gleaned from its financials the reit has a total debt to total capital ratio of  with  billion worth of assets  billion worth of debt and total cash on hand worth  million the revenue figures for the  period show how steadily profitable government properties is year revenue    million   million   million   million   million such revenue figures have supported the steady dividend payments that government properties has paid their shareholders since  prospective shareholders are currently offered a dividend yield of  with a somewhat high but tolerable payout ratio of  backed by a solid business model the key risk to this business would be the inability to either renew their leases with their existing tenants or find new tenants for its properties however this reit has minimized this risk admirably the leases that do exist are not set to start expiring until  and the nature of the tenants  government agencies  would find it cumbersome to relocate their operations to other premises the likelihood that the current tenants will renew their leases when the expiry date approaches is therefore very strong investors can therefore assume that government properties income trust looks set to continue collecting rental fees from the us government and rewarding their shareholders for years to come and proceed accordingly disclaimer the author is not a
