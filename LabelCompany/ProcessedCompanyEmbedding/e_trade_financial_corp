gaap measures by excluding or including certain items is helpful to investors and analysts who may wish to use some or all of this information to analyze the company’s current performance prospects and valuation management uses this nongaap information internally to evaluate operating performance and in formulating the budget for future periods management believes that the nongaap measures discussed below are appropriate for evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the company adjusted operating margin adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted income before income taxes by net revenue adjusted income before income taxes excludes the provision benefit for loan losses management believes that excluding the provision benefit for loan losses from operating margin provides a useful measure of the companys ongoing operating performance because management excludes it when evaluating operating margin performance see endnote  for a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the comparable gaap measure corporate cash corporate cash represents cash held at the parent company as well as cash held in certain subsidiaries not including bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries that can distribute cash to the parent company without any regulatory approval or notification the company believes that corporate cash is a useful measure of the parent

capital strength see endnote  for a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the comparable gaap measure it is important to note that these nongaap measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to not as substitutes for or superior to measures prepared in accordance with gaap for additional information on the adjustments to these nongaap measures please see

also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
