all humans on earth   early years born in price utah in  steve davis grew up in tucson arizona where his father was institute director at the university of arizona between  he is a th generation descendant of parley p pratt “my father dr h clyde davis was hired by president dwight d eisenhower in  as chief geologist atomic energy commission and very important to the us government for gathering additional wealth to rule the nation federal mining claims were under the total control of my dad he had eight airplanes in salt lake city to map out the whole us for eight years under eisenhower clyde davis did all the covert mining and interstate freeway mapping clyde was so successful through his professional expertise he was honored in  through a meeting with five great leaders us secretary of agriculture ezra taft benson former president harry s truman president dwight d eisenhower general omar bradley and mormon president david o mckay through his services since world war ii in keeping america safe after this meeting the family moved to tucson arizona where his father commenced staking various mining claims on us bureau of land management and us forest service lands for patenting and conversion into private property for the recovery of the precious metals “at this time i was only four years old throughout my life i traveled with my father assisting him in the evaluation testing and staking of mining claims on various federal state and private lands mostly in the western and central united states west of the mississippi” my personal knowledge of “angels” began when i was seven in  when i was seven years old i knew i was going to die after my jealous cousin jerked the reins of a horse and the horse galloped into the desert with my foot caught in the stirrup i then witnessed uncle demar rust stop the horse physically take my foot out of the stirrup wink and disappear” while he was being rushed to the hospital with his wrist bleeding very badly steve asked his mother if she had seen uncle demar she broke into tears because she had just buried him in salt lake city six months earlier” all steves life he didn’t feel a part of his family “i look totally different from my three brothers and sister” he said but why did i look exactly like uncle demar at seven i began to investigate” steve was very curious about “guardian angels” and why he had one he began talking with lds institute students and searched the institute library for information about angels he learned he should extend his hand and challenge any angelic visitor doctrine  covenants – beginning in  he started reading his ancestor parley p pratt’s autobiography because of pratts spiritual experiences ﻿ “when i was  years old i became a mormon through my father baptizing me i am still a member of the church founded by joseph smith” atomic nuclear testing “in june  my mother’s father woodruff rust mysteriously died at the young age of  he owned the hotel kanab and the north rim lodge at the grand canyon” anna belle left tucson arizona and buried her father in salt lake city “to connect all the ‘dots’ of secrecy and the ciansa with the mormon church newly called apostle howard w hunter came to tucson arizona in june  just before the death of woodruff in salt lake city and called dr h clyde davis to be in charge of all institutes and religion teachers under the employment of the mormon church and create a ‘new direction’ ” by october conference time steves mother was very upset when she discovered her father died due to nuclear fallout of the governments nevada testing clyde was the whistleblower of the nevada open air testing of nuclear bombs when he found a memo in the file stating the tests would only happen when the air was going ne into utah president harry s truman rd degree mason had signed the order for the nevada nuclear testing to destroy the mormons he shared this information with us secretary of agriculture ezra taft benson and president eisenhower and stopped the testing three prophetic dreams and my october   near death experience “on october   my mother had an exact dream of one of her sons having a head injury the next night she had an identical dream the third night was the same after three consecutive dreams she knew that her oldest son was going to have an auto accident with his scooter he was  and his name was hot “rod” he was very careless because rarely did he have a father home to discipline him she didn’t dream it didnt deal with my brother i was the “target” while in a coma i saw my yearold physical body down on an operating table and i knew i was dying i saw someone approaching me i knew what to do i extended my hand and challenged this spiritual being and asked ‘who are you’ as instructed for anyone since  dc  the angel extended his ‘spiritual hand’ and stated ‘i am angel moroni you need to restore what i delivered back in  are you willing to do that’ after i said ‘yes’ i experienced three days in a coma i remember everything that happened like it was yesterday today” “famous chicago catholic head surgeon dr fonseca was present at st mary’s catholic hospital visiting a relative as the arizona highway patrol car arrived with my lifeless body he successfully removed the bullet and part of my damaged skull if i had died clyde davis would have been arrested for negligent homicide and for that sole reason the cop didn’t wait for an ambulance because he figured i was going to die before i arrived at the hospital after i woke up from my  day coma over  telephone calls telegrams and letters flooded the hospital during my  days by the time dr fonseca operated and placed a metal plate of my ‘hole’ i had been interviewed by the news media from all over the world plus tens of thousands of prayer and support messages the rifle that shot me was a  caliber rifle much more powerful than the rifle that killed president john f kennedy my brains should have blown away when the bullet hit me anna belle was very calm after the gun shot wound she knew what to do from her dream just before dr fonseca operated and placed a metallic plate over the hole left side above and in front of my ear this doctor thanked me for allowing him to again believe in ‘angels’ because he had turned to atheism “president eisenhower spoke with me after i recovered and i shared with him information from my three day coma telling him i got the same information given to the apostle paul  years earlier president eisenhower turned over the cia funding jones trust central dominion bank account ny federal reserve bank of  trillion to ezra taft benson and clyde davis” legal background i am not an attorney i attended one full year    at northrop university—straight as in law school the professors were all california judges and they told me not to become an agent for the california bar for several years while i was assistant to the president at northrop i took several aerospace engineering classes i then took several mining engineering classes while i was the general manager for the college of mines and mineral science at the university of utah this was followed by two years of law classes at utah valley state college when i became a paralegalprivate investigatorexpert witness college and early career “i am a business college graduate and international finance degree double major and the professional engineer through hands on experience when i was senior vice president at newberry engineering tempe az public company i had  professional engineers working on government contracts all throughout the western us i had access to any of these experts in the air cargo airport project this was all back during the s i also received my gemolgistcertifed diamond appraiser license utah securities license utah real estate license during this time too when in january  the quorum of the twelve and members of the church through majority vote dc  every april of every year decided to have a prophet govern the church rather than the quorum of the  since  the church was cursed for three or four generations this curse didnt apply to steven davis apostle parley p pratt disobeyed the lord and participated with the majority of the members and quorum the church was cursed i am a fifth generation of elder pratt parley p pratt memorial “back in  i commissioned book of mormon artist arnold friberg to design me a memorial for parley p pratt the design was endorsed by church historian and apostle howard w hunter back in  while i was assistant to the president northrop university inglewood california and on national radio with former california governor ronald reagan concerning the largest bicentennial activity amercian hall of aviation history at lax i was in charge of it i was the one who saved the howard hughes spruce goose in june  i got missouri governor christopher bond to remove the  extermination order by governor boggs at an rlds stake conference in liberty missouri president kimball didn’t want the mormon church involved in this removal in  i grew up in tucson where elder kimball was a thatchersafford stake president and bankinsurance officer ﻿aloe vera plantation “in the s i purchased an aloe vera plantation on the island of dominica first island discovered by christopher columbus and developed an important product to enhance the immune system of the human body lds bishop and judge of israel ﻿ “in  i was called by the president former us secretary of agriculture and his two counselors present president hinckley and president monson of the mormon church to become a prominent church leader one who is treated equally to the president apostles and other leaders a bishop in  dr h clyde davis sued zions first national bank for illegally removing money from his bank account zions bank added me in the lawsuit in  i contacted church leaders apostles about their personal liability serving on this bank board and that we had evidence that would cause them to be excommunicated from the mormon church two apostles resigned from the bank board two others refused to resigned they worked with and under dr h clyde davis for many years in the s  s president ezra taft benson believed in him and that he would fulfill the above promise from the lord president benson knew all about his near death experience with angel moroni and called him to be a “judge of israel” and a prominent church leader just before he gave his famous “pride” talk – condemning members for not reading and understanding the warnings found in the book of mormon about the condition of the “church” at the time of the millennium commencing april   gordon hinckley and tom monson who became presidents of the mormon church also signed his bishop’s certificate authorizing him to be a special witness for the lord in  in the s i studied all the records of the jewish early christian moslim eras at the university of arizona and brigham young university with zeal and the desire to know why i was told certain things by the angel moroni while i was in a coma between october   at the st marys hospital tucson arizona the president of the united states called me after i came out of the coma he was praying for me with his secretary of agriculture ezra taft benson because of the position of my father dr h clyde davis he was the one who accidently shot me — chief geologist for the us government and the new presidential elections were the next week we all know how the  presidential elections was controlled through the ballot fraud in certain states it was after my accidential shoting when president eisenhower turned over the cia slush fund to benson central dominion trust ny federal reserve bank   trillion bank account this bank account was used commencing in september  using our agreement with merrill lynch to buy up over  metric ton of gold all over the world i have filed these documents all over the world exposing this stuff why because i was told by angel moroni that truth needs to be spoken especially those who have been converted to jesus christ and still need to be bornagain see john chapter  ﻿zions bank fraud “i was summoned to the mormon church court in march  the same week we successfully settled with zions bank in the law suit by dr h clyde davis i attended a church court council in may  for many hours defending myself the mormon church leader apologized and cancelled the rest of the hearing because i had a considerable amount of evidence proving fraud i continued as a very active member during this time i had another law suit against another prominent church leader judge pat b brian a utah state judge i dropped my law suit against him he had illegallyfraudulent brought a day old baby from dallas texas to me in utah without texas approving the adoption because his wife was the sister of another mormon apostle he would have been excommunicated from the mormon church certain leaders were scared about being exposed by the evidence dr davis and i had gathered dr davis was retired and didnt want to proceed in either the courts of the land or the courts of the mormon church i am still a member and active because of the illegal actions by mr studdert in november  another mormon church court in utah stephen m studdert former assistant to three us presidents was held without my knowledge at this time i was living in nevada and knew nothing about this excommunication by mr studdert he was the one who held the church court in  i properly notified the mormon church leaders and asked for a hearing using my rights as a baptized member of the church to date they havent allowed me my membership rights to a rehearing challenging what stephen m studdert did the following is the exact working in the mormon church doctrine about excommunication “should the parties or either of them be dissatisfied with the decision of said council they may appeal to the high council of the seat of the first presidency of the church and have a rehearing which case shall there be conducted according to the former pattern written as though no such decision had been made doctrine  covenants  you are welcome to ask apostle richard g scott or apostle jeffrey h holland if this is not the case their telephone number is   salt lake city utah “i am still a mormon i attend church i support it i am not a member of any other church but the one formed by joseph smith stephen m studdert  inspector javert les misérables “because of my fathers position within the freemasonry operation of the us and my having survived his shooting accident violating arizona laws with a loaded rifle in the truck many leaders are superstitious of me they monitor everything i do they try to copycat the cities of peace designed by me back in  happened because of a business my father was given by the owners of san manuel arizona a drug store they owned an underground copper mine and built a city in the mountains i saved them lots of money by flying cargo to their community rather than trucking it through winding roads i give fulldisclosure about my life because of this secret monitoring it was headed up by my father until his mysterious death on easter weekend  in provo utah he had signed an affidavit five weeks earlier supporting my missouri operation  he had repented and confessed for being a spy and highlevel mason with the one world order since  because he saw events happen as i had said and i knew all about the corruption of the leaders of the lds church in spite of their sophisticated public relationsimage while in brazil my father let me know his direct knowledge of mining operations he was directly involved with in chile south america including mining claims of alan bond of australia became barrick gold because of that knowledge i traveled to vancouver several times and met with jorge lopehandia and warned him of the many death threats my father and i have received since the s

ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone
