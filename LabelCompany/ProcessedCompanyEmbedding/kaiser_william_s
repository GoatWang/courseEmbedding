william iv was king of prussia and his grandfather and namesake wilhelm was acting as regent he was the first grandchild of queen victoria and prince albert but more importantly as the first son of the crown prince of prussia wilhelm was from  second in the line of succession to prussia and also after  to the newly created german empire which according to the constitution of the german empire was ruled by the prussian king wilhelm with his father in highland dress in  a traumatic breech birth left him with a withered left arm due to erbs palsy which he tried with some success to conceal in many photos he carries a pair of white gloves in his left hand to make the arm seem longer holds his left hand with his right or has his crippled arm on the hilt of a sword or holding a cane to give the effect of a useful limb posed at a dignified angle his left arm was about  inches  centimetres shorter than his right arm historians have suggested that this disability affected his emotional developmentdubious – discuss early years in  wilhelm was taken to england to be present at the wedding of his uncle bertie later king edward vii and princess alexandra of denmark william attended the ceremony in a highland costume complete with a small toy dirk during the ceremony the fouryearold became restless his eighteenyearold uncle alfred duke of saxecoburg and gotha charged with keeping an eye on him told him to be quiet but wilhelm drew his dirk and threatened alfred when alfred attempted to subdue him by force wilhelm bit him on the leg his grandmother queen victoria missed seeing the fracas to her wilhelm remained a clever dear good little child the great favourite of my beloved vicky his mother vicky was obsessed with his damaged arm she blamed herself for the childs handicap and insisted that he become a good rider the thought that he as heir to the throne should not be able to ride was intolerable to her riding lessons began when wilhelm was eight and were a matter of endurance for wilhelm over and over the weeping prince was set on his horse and compelled to go through the paces he fell off time after time but despite his tears was set on its back again after weeks of this he finally got it right and was able to maintain his balance wilhelm from six years of age was tutored and heavily influenced by the yearold teacher georg hinzpeter hinzpeter he later wrote was really a good fellow whether he was the right tutor for me i dare not decide the torments inflicted on me in this pony riding must be attributed to my mother as a teenager he was educated at kassel at the friedrichsgymnasium in january  wilhelm finished high school and on his eighteenth birthday received as a present from his grandmother queen victoria the order of the garter after kassel he spent four terms at the university of bonn studying law and politics he became a member of the exclusive corps borussia bonn wilhelm possessed a quick intelligence but this was often overshadowed by a cantankerous temper prussian royalty house of hohenzollern wilhelm ii children crown prince wilhelm prince eitel friedrich prince adalbert prince august wilhelm prince oskar prince joachim victoria louise duchess of brunswick v t e as a scion of the royal house of hohenzollern wilhelm was exposed from an early age to the military society of the prussian aristocracy this had a major impact on him and in maturity wilhelm was seldom seen out of uniform the hypermasculine military culture of prussia in this period did much to frame his political ideals and personal relationships crown prince frederick was viewed by his son with a deeply felt love and respect his fathers status as a hero of the wars of unification was largely responsible for the young wilhelms attitude as were the circumstances in which he was raised close emotional contact between father and son was not encouraged later as he came into contact with the crown princes political opponents wilhelm came to adopt more ambivalent feelings toward his father perceiving the influence of wilhelms mother over a figure who should have been possessed of masculine independence and strength wilhelm also idolised his grandfather wilhelm i and he was instrumental in later attempts to foster a cult of the first german emperor as wilhelm the great however he had a distant relationship with his mother wilhelm resisted attempts by his parents especially his mother to educate him in british attitudes towards democracy instead he agreed with his german tutors support of autocratic rule and gradually became thoroughly prussianized under their influence he thus became alienated from his parents suspecting them of putting britains interests first the german emperor wilhelm i watched as his grandson guided principally by the crown princess victoria grew to manhood when wilhelm was nearing twentyone the emperor decided it was time his grandson should begin the military phase of his preparation for the throne he was assigned as a lieutenant to the first regiment of foot guards stationed at potsdam in the guards wilhelm said i really found my family my friends my interests — everything of which i had up to that time had to do without as a boy and a student his manner had been polite and agreeable as an officer he began to strut and speak brusquely in the tone he deemed appropriate for a prussian officer in many ways wilhelm was a victim of his inheritance and of otto von bismarcks machinations both sides of his family had suffered from mental illness and this may explain his emotional instabilitycitation needed when wilhelm was in his early twenties bismarck tried to separate him from his parents who opposed bismarck and his policies with some success bismarck planned to use the young prince as a weapon against his parents in order to retain his own political dominance wilhelm thus developed a dysfunctional relationship with his parents but especially with his english mother in an outburst in april  wilhelm angrily implied that an english doctor killed my father and an english doctor crippled my arm – which is the fault of my mother who allowed no german physicians to attend to herself or her immediate family as a young man wilhelm fell in love with one of his maternal first cousins princess elisabeth of hessedarmstadt she however turned him down and would in time marry into the russian imperial family in  however wilhelm became engaged to augusta victoria of schleswigholstein known as dona the couple married on  february  and would remain married for forty years until her death in  in a period of ten years between  and  augusta victoria would bear wilhelm seven children six sons and a daughter beginning in  bismarck began advocating that kaiser wilhelm send his grandson on various diplomatic missions a privilege denied to the crown prince that year prince wilhelm was sent to the court of tsar alexander iii of russia in st petersburg to attend the coming of age ceremony of the sixteenyearold tsarevich nicholas however wilhelms behavior did little to ingratiate himself to the tsar two years later kaiser wilhelm i took prince wilhelm on a trip to meet with the austrohungarian emperor franz joseph in  also thanks to herbert von bismarck the son of the chancellor prince wilhelm began to be trained twice a week at the foreign ministry one

message the german emperor wilhelm i died in berlin on  march  and prince wilhelms father was proclaimed emperor as frederick iii he was already suffering from an incurable throat cancer and spent all  days of his reign fighting the disease before dying on  june of that same year his yearold son succeeded him as german emperor and king of prussia although in his youth he had been a great admirer of otto von bismarck wilhelms characteristic impatience soon brought him into conflict with the iron chancellor the dominant figure in the foundation of his empire the new emperor opposed bismarcks careful foreign policy preferring vigorous and rapid expansion to protect germanys place in the sun furthermore the young emperor had come to the throne determined to rule as well as reign unlike his grandfather while the letter of the imperial constitution vested executive power in the emperor wilhelm i had been content to leave daytoday administration to bismarck early conflicts between wilhelm ii and his chancellor soon poisoned the relationship between the two men bismarck believed that wilhelm was a lightweight who could be dominated and he showed scant respect for wilhelms policies in the late s the final split between monarch and statesman occurred soon after an attempt by bismarck to implement a farreaching antisocialist law in early  break with bismarck in this photo of wilhelm

could i shall not be a party to it bismarck after gaining an absolute majority in favour of his policies in the reichstag decided to make the antisocialist laws permanent his kartell the majority of the amalgamated conservative party and the national liberal party favoured making the laws permanent with one exception the police power to expel socialist agitators from their homes the kartell split over this issue and nothing was passed as the debate continued wilhelm became more and more interested in social problems especially the treatment of mine workers who went on strike in  he routinely interrupted bismarck in council to make clear where he stood on social policy bismarck sharply disagreed with wilhelms policy and worked to circumvent it wilhelm ii german emperor bismarck feeling pressured and unappreciated by the young emperor and undermined by his ambitious advisors refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with wilhelm as was required by the german constitution the final break came as bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority with his kartell voted from power due to the antisocialist bill fiasco the remaining powers in the reichstag were the catholic centre party and the conservative party bismarck wished to form a new bloc with the centre party and invited ludwig windthorst the partys parliamentary leader to discuss a coalition wilhelm was furious to hear about windthorsts visit in a parliamentary state the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to ensure his policies a majority but in germany the chancellor had to depend on the confidence of the emperor and wilhelm believed that the emperor had the right to be informed before his ministers meeting after a heated argument at bismarcks estate over imperial authority wilhelm stormed out bismarck forced for the first time into a situation he could not use to his advantage wrote a blistering letter of resignation decrying wilhelms interference in foreign and domestic policy which was published only after bismarcks death although bismarck had sponsored landmark social security legislation by – he had become disillusioned with the attitude of workers in particular he was opposed to wage increases improving working conditions and regulating labour relations moreover the kartell the shifting political coalition that bismarck had been able to forge since  had lost a working majority in the reichstag at the opening of the reichstag on  may  the kaiser stated that the most pressing issue was the further enlargement of the bill concerning the protection of the labourer in  the reichstag passed the workers protection acts which improved working conditions protected

chlodwig prince of hohenloheschillingsfürst in  following the dismissal of hohenlohe in  wilhelm appointed the man whom he regarded as his own bismarck bernhard von bülow in foreign policy bismarck had achieved a fragile balance of interests between germany france and russia—peace was at hand and bismarck tried to keep it that way despite growing popular sentiment against britain regarding colonies and especially against russia with bismarcks dismissal the russians now expected a reversal of policy in berlin so they quickly came to terms with france beginning the process that by  largely isolated germany monarchical styles of german emperor wilhelm ii king of prussia reference style his imperial and royal majesty spoken style your imperial and royal majesty alternative style sire in appointing caprivi and then hohenlohe wilhelm was embarking upon what is known to history as the new course in which he hoped to exert decisive influence in the government of the empire there is debate amongst historians as to the precise degree to which wilhelm succeeded in implementing personal rule in this era but what is clear is the very different dynamic which existed between the crown and its chief political servant the chancellor in the wilhelmine era these chancellors were senior civil servants and not seasoned politicianstatesmen like bismarck wilhelm wanted to preclude the emergence of another iron chancellor whom he ultimately detested as being a boorish old killjoy who had not permitted any minister to see the emperor except in his presence keeping a stranglehold on effective political power upon his enforced retirement and until his dying day bismarck was to become a bitter critic of wilhelms policies but without the support of the supreme arbiter of all political appointments the emperor there was little chance of bismarck exerting a decisive influence on policy silver mark coin of wilhelm ii something which bismarck was able to effect was the creation of the bismarck myth this was a view—which some would argue was confirmed by subsequent events—that with the dismissal of the iron chancellor wilhelm ii effectively destroyed any chance germany had of stable and effective government in this view wilhelms new course was characterised far more as the german ship of state going out of control eventually leading through a series of crises to the carnage of the first and second world wars in the early twentieth century wilhelm began to concentrate upon his real agenda the creation of a german navy that would rival that of britain and enable germany to declare itself a world power he ordered his military leaders to read admiral alfred thayer mahans book the influence of sea power upon history and spent hours drawing sketches of the ships that he wanted built bülow and bethmann hollweg his loyal chancellors looked after domestic affairs while wilhelm began to spread alarm in the chancellories of europe with his increasingly eccentric views on foreign affairs promoter of arts and sciences wilhelm enthusiastically promoted the arts and sciences as well as public education and social welfare he sponsored the kaiser wilhelm society for the promotion of scientific research it was funded by wealthy private donors and by the state and comprised a number of research institutes in both pure and applied sciences the prussian academy of sciences was unable to avoid the kaisers pressure and lost some of its autonomy when it was forced to incorporate new programs in engineering and award new fellowships in engineering sciences as a result of a gift from the kaiser in  wilhelm supported the modernisers as they tried to reform the prussian system of secondary education which was rigidly traditional elitist politically authoritarian and unchanged by the progress in the natural sciences as hereditary protector of the order of saint john he offered encouragement to the christian orders attempts to place german medicine at the forefront of modern medical practice through its system of hospitals nursing sisterhood and nursing schools and nursing homes throughout the german empire wilhelm continued as protector of the order even after  as the position was in essence attached to the head of the house of hohenzollern personality emperor wilhelm ii talks with ethiopians at the tierpark hagenbeck in hamburg in  historians have frequently stressed the role of wilhelms personality in shaping his reign thus thomas nipperdey concludes he was gifted with a quick understanding sometimes brilliant with a taste for the modern—technology industry science—but at the same time superficial hasty restless unable to relax without any deeper level of seriousness without any desire for hard work or drive to see things through to the end without any sense of sobriety for balance and boundaries or even for reality and real problems uncontrollable and scarcely capable of learning from experience desperate for applause and success—as bismarck said early on in his life he wanted every day to be his birthday—romantic sentimental and theatrical unsure and arrogant with an immeasurably exaggerated selfconfidence and desire to show off a juvenile cadet who never took the tone of the officers mess out of his voice and brashly wanted to play the part of the supreme warlord full of panicky fear of a monotonous life without any diversions and yet aimless pathological in his hatred against his english mother historian david fromkin states that wilhelm had a lovehate relationship with britain according to fromkin from the outset the halfgerman side of him was at war with the halfenglish side he was wildly jealous of the british wanting to be british wanting to be better at being british than the british were while at the same time hating them and resenting them because he never could be fully accepted by them langer et al  emphasize the negative international consequences of wilhelms erratic personality he believed in force and the survival of the fittest in domestic as well as foreign politics william was not lacking in intelligence but he did lack stability disguising his deep insecurities by swagger and tough talk he frequently fell into depressions and hysterics williams personal instability was reflected in vacillations of policy his actions at home as well as abroad lacked guidance and therefore often bewildered or infuriated public opinion he was not so much concerned with gaining specific objectives as had been the case with bismarck as with asserting his will this trait in the ruler of the leading continental power was one of the main causes of the uneasiness prevailing in europe at the turnofthecentury relationships with foreign relatives as a grandchild of queen victoria wilhelm was a first cousin of the british empires king george v as well as of queens marie of romania maud of wales and victoria eugenie of spain and of the empress alexandra of russia in  wilhelms younger sister sophia married the future king constantine i of greece wilhelm infuriated by his sisters conversion to greek orthodoxy upon her marriage attempted to ban her from

george v of the united kingdom and king frederick viii of denmark wilhelms most contentious relationships were with his british relations he craved the acceptance of his grandmother queen victoria and of the rest of her family despite the fact that his grandmother treated him with courtesy and tact his other relatives found him arrogant and obnoxious and they largely denied him acceptance he had an especially bad relationship with his uncle bertie the prince of wales later king edward vii between  and  wilhelm resented his uncle himself a mere heir to the english throne treating wilhelm not as emperor of germany but merely as another nephew in turn wilhelm often snubbed his uncle whom he referred to as the old peacock and lorded his position as emperor over him beginning in the s wilhelm made visits to england for cowes week on the isle of wight and often competed against his uncle in the yacht races edwards wife the danishborn alexandra first as princess of wales and later as queen also disliked wilhelm never forgetting the prussian seizure of schleswigholstein from denmark in the s as well as being annoyed over wilhelms treatment of his mother despite his poor relations with his english relatives nevertheless when he received news that queen victoria was dying at osborne house in january  wilhelm traveled to england and was at her bedside when she died and remained for the funeral he also was present at the funeral of king edward vii in  in  wilhelm hosted a lavish wedding in berlin for his only daughter victoria louise among the guests at the wedding were tsar nicholas ii of russia who also disliked wilhelm and his english cousin king george v and his wife queen mary antisemitism wilhelms biographer lamar cecil identified wilhelms curious but welldeveloped antisemitism noting that in  a friend of wilhelm declared that the young kaisers dislike of his hebrew subjects one rooted in a perception that they possessed an overweening influence in germany was so strong that it could not be overcome cecil concludes wilhelm never changed and throughout his life he believed that jews were perversely responsible largely through their prominence in the berlin press and in leftist political movements for encouraging opposition to his rule for individual jews ranging from rich businessmen and major art collectors to purveyors of elegant goods in berlin stores he had considerable esteem but he prevented jewish citizens from having careers in the army and the diplomatic corps and frequently used abusive language against them on  december  wilhelm wrote to field marshal august von mackensen denouncing his own abdication as the deepest most disgusting shame ever perpetrated by a person in history the germans have done to themselves egged on and misled by the tribe of judah  let no german ever forget this nor rest until these parasites have been destroyed and exterminated from german soil wilhelm advocated a regular international allworlds

nicholas ii of russia in  wearing the military uniforms of each others nations german foreign policy under wilhelm ii was faced with a number of significant problems perhaps the most apparent was that wilhelm was an impatient man subjective in his reactions and affected strongly by sentiment and impulse he was personally illequipped to steer german foreign policy along a rational course it is now widely recognised that the various spectacular acts which wilhelm undertook in the international sphere were often partially encouraged by the german foreign policy elite there were a number of notorious examples such as the kruger telegram of  in which wilhelm congratulated president paul kruger of the transvaal republic on the suppression of the british jameson raid thus alienating british public opinion british public opinion had been quite favourable toward the kaiser in his first twelve years on the throne but it turned sour in the late s during the first world war he became the central target of british antigerman propaganda and the personification of a hated enemy wilhelm invented and spread fears of a yellow peril trying to interest other european rulers in the perils they faced by invading china few other leaders paid attention wilhelm used the japanese victory in the russojapanese war to try and incite fear in the west of the yellow peril they faced by a resurgent japan which wilhelm claimed would ally with china to overrun the west under wilhelm germany invested in strengthening its colonies in africa and the pacific but few became profitable and all were lost during the first world war in south west africa now namibia a native revolt against german rule led to the herero and namaqua genocide although wilhelm eventually ordered it to be stopped one of the few times when wilhelm succeeded in personal diplomacy was when in  he supported the marriage of archduke franz ferdinand of austria to sophie chotek against the wishes of emperor franz joseph i of

wilhelm delivered this speech in bremerhaven on  july  addressing german troops who were departing to suppress the boxer rebellion in china the speech was infused with wilhelms fiery and chauvinistic rhetoric and clearly expressed his vision of german imperial power there were two versions of the speech the foreign office issued an edited version making sure to omit one particularly incendiary paragraph that they regarded as diplomatically embarrassing the edited version read like this great overseas tasks have fallen to the new german empire tasks far greater than many of my countrymen expected the german empire has by its very character the obligation to assist its citizens if they are being set upon in foreign lands the tasks that the old roman empire of the german nation was unable to accomplish the new german empire is in a position to fulfill the means that make this possible is our army it has been built up during thirty years of faithful peaceful labor following the principles of my blessed grandfather you too have received your training in accordance with these principles and by putting them to the test before the enemy you should see whether they have proved their worth in you your comrades in the navy have already passed this test they have shown that the principles of your training are sound and i am also proud of the praise that your comrades have earned over there from foreign leaders it is up to you to emulate them a great task awaits you you are to revenge the grievous injustice that has been done the chinese have overturned the law of

presence was seen as an assertion of german interests in morocco in opposition to those of france in his speech he even made remarks in favour of moroccan independence and this led to friction with france which had expanding colonial interests in morocco and to the algeciras conference which served largely to further isolate germany in europe wilhelm ii and winston churchill during a military

had a far greater impact in germany than overseas the daily telegraph affair of  involved the publication in germany of an interview with a british daily newspaper that included wild statements and diplomatically damaging remarks wilhelm had seen the interview as an opportunity to promote his views and ideas on anglogerman friendship but due to his emotional outbursts during the course of the interview he ended up further alienating not only the british but also the french russians and japanese he implied among other things that the germans cared nothing for the british that the french and russians had attempted to incite germany to intervene in the second boer war and that the german naval buildup was targeted against the japanese not britain one memorable quotation from the interview was you english are mad mad mad as march hares the effect in germany was quite significant with serious calls for his abdication wilhelm kept a very low profile for many months after the daily telegraph fiasco but later exacted his revenge by forcing the resignation of the chancellor prince bülow who had abandoned the emperor to public scorn by not having the transcript edited before its german publication the daily telegraph crisis deeply wounded wilhelms previously unimpaired selfconfidence and he soon suffered a severe bout of depression from which he never fully recovered he lost

prince of wales that his dream was to have a fleet of my own some day wilhelms frustration over his fleets poor showing at the fleet review at his grandmother queen victorias diamond jubilee celebrations combined with his inability to exert german influence in south africa following the dispatch of the kruger telegram led to wilhelm taking definitive steps toward the construction of a

joseph i of austria to sign a declaration of war against serbia as a direct consequence russia began a general mobilization to attack austria in defense of serbia july  main article july crisis emperor wilhelm in conversation with the victor of liège general otto von emmich in the background the generals hans von plessen middle and moriz von lyncker right on the night of  july when handed a document stating that russia would not cancel its mobilization wilhelm wrote a lengthy commentary containing these observations for i no longer have any doubt that england russia and france have agreed among themselves—knowing that our treaty obligations compel us to support austria—to use the austroserb conflict as a pretext for waging a war of annihilation against us our dilemma over keeping faith with the old and honourable emperor has been exploited to create a situation which gives england the excuse she has been seeking to annihilate us with a spurious appearance of justice on the pretext that she is helping france and maintaining the wellknown balance of power in europe ie playing off all european states for her own benefit against us more recent british authors state that wilhelm ii really declared ruthlessness and weakness will start the most terrifying war of the world whose purpose is to destroy germany because there can no longer be any doubts england france and russia have conspired themselves together to fight an annihilation war against us an das deutsche volk extract from wilhelms public address for mobilization  august  problems playing this file see media help when it became clear that germany would experience a war on two fronts and that britain would enter the war if germany attacked france through neutral belgium the panicstricken wilhelm attempted to redirect the main attack against russia when helmuth von moltke the younger who had chosen the old plan from  made by general von schlieffen for the possibility of german war on two fronts told him that this was impossible wilhelm said your uncle would have given me a different answer wilhelm is also reported to have said to think that george and nicky should have played me false if my grandmother had been alive she would never have allowed it in the original schlieffen plan germany would attack the supposed weaker enemy first meaning france the plan supposed that it would take a long time before russia was ready for war defeating france had been easy for prussia in the francoprussian war in  at the  border between france and germany an attack at this more southern part of france could be stopped by the french fortress along the border however wilhelm ii stopped any invasion of the netherlands italian poster from  showing wilhelm ii biting into the world the text reads the glutton – too hard shadowkaiser hindenburg wilhelm ii and ludendorff in january  wilhelms role in wartime was of everdecreasing power as he increasingly handled awards ceremonies and honorific duties the high command continued with its strategy even when it was clear that the schlieffen plan had failed by  the empire had effectively become a military dictatorship under the control of field marshal paul von hindenburg and general erich ludendorff increasingly cut off from reality and the political decisionmaking process wilhelm vacillated between defeatism and dreams of victory depending upon the fortunes of his armies nevertheless wilhelm still retained the ultimate authority in matters of political appointment and it was only after his consent had been gained that major changes to the high command could be effected wilhelm was in favour of the dismissal of helmuth von moltke the younger in september  and his replacement by erich von falkenhayn in  hindenburg and ludendorff decided that bethmanhollweg was no longer acceptable to them as chancellor and called upon the kaiser to appoint somebody else when asked whom they would accept ludendorff recommended georg michaelis a nonentity he barely knew the kaiser did not know michaelis but accepted the suggestion upon hearing in july  that his cousin george v had changed the name of the british royal house to windsor wilhelm remarked that he planned to see shakespeares play the merry wives of saxecoburggotha the kaisers support collapsed completely in october–november  in the army in the civilian government and in german public opinion as president woodrow wilson made clear the kaiser could no longer be a party to peace negotiations that year also saw wilhelm sickened during the worldwide  flu pandemic though he survived abdication and flight wikisource has original text related to this article statement of abdication wilhelm was at the imperial army headquarters in spa belgium when the uprisings in berlin and other centres took him by surprise in late  mutiny among the ranks of his beloved kaiserliche marine the imperial navy profoundly shocked him after the outbreak of the german revolution wilhelm could not make up his mind whether or not to abdicate up to that point he accepted that he would likely have to give up the imperial crown but still hoped to retain the prussian kingship however this was impossible under the imperial constitution while wilhelm thought he ruled as emperor in a personal union with prussia the constitution actually tied the imperial crown to the prussian crown meaning that wilhelm could not renounce one crown without renouncing the other wilhelms hopes of retaining at least one of his crowns was revealed as unrealistic when in the hope of preserving the monarchy in the face of growing revolutionary unrest chancellor prince max of baden announced wilhelms abdication of both titles on  november  prince max himself was forced to resign later the same day when it became clear that only friedrich ebert leader of the spd could effectively exert control later that day one of eberts secretaries of state ministers social democrat philipp scheidemann proclaimed germany a republic wilhelm consented to the abdication only after ludendorffs replacement general wilhelm groener had informed him that the officers and men of the army would march back in good order under paul von hindenburgs command but would certainly not fight for wilhelms throne on the home front the monarchys last and strongest support had been broken and finally even hindenburg himself a lifelong royalist was obliged with some embarrassment to advise the emperor to give up the crown the fact that the high command might one day abandon the kaiser had been foreseen in december  when wilhelm had visited otto von bismarck for the last time bismarck had again warned the kaiser about the increasing influence of militarists especially of the admirals who were pushing for the construction of a battle fleet bismarcks last warning had been your majesty so long as you have this present officer corps you can do as you please but when this is no longer the case it will be very different for you subsequently bismarck had predicted accurately jena came twenty years after the death of frederick the great the crash will come twenty years after my departure if things go on like this on  november wilhelm crossed the border by train and went into exile in the netherlands which had remained neutral throughout the war upon the conclusion of the treaty of versailles in early  article  expressly provided for the prosecution of wilhelm for a supreme offence against international morality and the sanctity of treaties but the dutch government refused to extradite him despite appeals from the allies king george v wrote that he looked on his cousin as the greatest criminal in history but opposed prime minister david lloyd georges proposal to hang the kaiser president woodrow wilson of the united states rejected extradition arguing that prosecuting wilhelm would destabilize international order and lose the peace wilhelm first settled in amerongen where on  november he issued a belated statement of abdication from both the prussian and imperial thrones thus formally ending the hohenzollerns year rule over prussia accepting the reality that he had lost both of his crowns for good he gave up his rights to the throne of prussia and to the german imperial throne connected therewith he also released his soldiers and officials in both prussia and the empire from their oath of loyalty to him he purchased a country house in the municipality of doorn known as huis doorn and moved in on  may  this was to be his home for the remainder of his life the weimar republic allowed wilhelm to remove twentythree railway wagons of furniture twentyseven containing packages of all sorts one bearing a car and another a boat from the new palace at potsdam life in exile in  wilhelm published the first volume of his memoirs—a very slim volume that insisted he was not guilty of initiating the great war and defended his conduct throughout his reign especially in matters of foreign policy for the remaining twenty years of his life he entertained guests often of some standing and kept himself updated on events in europe he grew a beard and allowed his famous moustache to droop he also learned the dutch language wilhelm developed a penchant for archaeology while residing at the corfu achilleion excavating at the site of the temple of artemis in corfu a passion he retained in his exile he had bought the former greek residence of empress elisabeth after her murder in  he also sketched plans for grand buildings and battleships when he was bored in exile one of wilhelms greatest passions was hunting and he bagged thousands of animals both beast and bird much of his time was spent chopping wood and thousands of trees were chopped down during his stay at doorn in the early s wilhelm apparently hoped that the successes of the german nazi party would stimulate interest in a restoration of the monarchy with his eldest grandson as the fourth kaiser his second wife hermine actively petitioned the nazi government on her husbands behalf however adolf hitler himself a veteran of the first world war like other leading nazis felt nothing but scorn for the man they blamed for germanys greatest defeat and the petitions were ignored though he played host to hermann göring at doorn on at least one occasion wilhelm grew to distrust hitler hearing of the murder of the wife of former chancellor schleicher he said we have ceased to live under the rule of law and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall wilhelm was also appalled at the kristallnacht of – november  saying i have just made my views clear to auwi wilhelms fourth son in the presence of his brothers he had the nerve to say that he agreed with the jewish pogroms and understood why they had come about when i told him that any decent man would describe these actions as gangsterisms he appeared totally indifferent he is completely lost to our family he also stated for the first time i am ashamed to be a german theres a man alone without family without children without god he builds legions but he doesnt build a nation a nation is created by families a religion traditions it is made up out of the hearts of mothers the wisdom of fathers the joy and the exuberance of children for a few months i was inclined to believe in national socialism i thought of it as a necessary fever and i was gratified to see that there were associated with it for a time some of the wisest and most outstanding germans but these one by one he has got rid of or even killed he has left nothing but a bunch of shirted gangsters this man could bring home victories to our people each year without bringing them either glory or danger but of our germany which was a nation of poets and musicians of artists and soldiers he has made a nation of hysterics and hermits engulfed in a mob and led by a thousand liars or fanatics ― wilhelm on hitler december  in the wake of the german victory over poland in september  wilhelms adjutant general von dommes wrote on his behalf to hitler stating that the house of hohenzollern remained loyal and noted that nine prussian princes one son and eight grandchildren were stationed at the front concluding because of the special circumstances that require residence in a neutral foreign country his majesty must personally decline to make the aforementioned comment the emperor has therefore charged me with making a communication wilhelm greatly admired the success which hitler was able to achieve in the opening months of the second world war and personally sent a congratulatory telegram when the netherlands surrendered in may  my fuhrer i congratulate you and hope that under your marvellous leadership the german monarchy will be restored completely hitler was reportedly exasperated and bemused and remarked to linge his valet what an idiot in another telegram to hitler upon the fall of paris a month later wilhelm stated congratulations you have won using my troops in a letter to his daughter victoria louise duchess of brunswick he wrote triumphantly thus is the pernicious entente cordiale of uncle edward vii brought to nought nevertheless after the nazi conquest of the netherlands in  the aging wilhelm retired completely from public life in may  when hitler invaded the netherlands wilhelm declined an offer from churchill of asylum in britain preferring to die at huis doorn during his last year at doorn wilhelm believed that germany was the land of monarchy and therefore of christ and that england was the land of liberalism and therefore of satan and the antichrist he argued that the english ruling classes were freemasons thoroughly infected by juda wilhelm asserted that the british people must be liberated from antichrist juda we must drive juda out of england just as he has been chased out of the continentclarification needed he believed the freemasons and jews had caused the two world wars aiming at a world jewish empire with british and american gold but that judas plan has been smashed to pieces and they themselves swept out of the european continent continental europe was now wilhelm wrote consolidating and closing itself off from british influences after the elimination of the british and the jews the end result would be a us of europeclarification needed in a letter of  to his sister princess margaret wilhelm wrote the hand of god is creating a new world  working miracles we are becoming the us of europe under german leadership a united european continent he added the jews are being thrust out of their nefarious positions in all countries whom they have driven to hostility for centuries also in  came what would have been his mothers th birthday on which he wrote ironically to a friend today the th birthday of my mother no notice is taken of it at home no memorial service or committee to remember her marvellous work for the welfare of our german people nobody of the new generation knows anything about her this sympathy for his mother is in sharp contrast to the intense animosity he expressed for her during most of her lifecitation needed the huis doorn in  wilhelm in  huis doorn in the netherlands death wilhelm iis tomb in doorn netherlands wilhelm died of a pulmonary embolus in doorn netherlands on  june  aged  just weeks before the axis invasion of the soviet union german soldiers had been guarding his house hitler however was reportedby whom to be angry that the former monarch had an honor guard of german troops and nearly fired the general who ordered them when he found out despite his personal animosity toward wilhelm hitler wanted to bring his body back to berlin for a state funeral as wilhelm was a symbol of germany and germans during the previous world war hitler felt that such a funeral would demonstrate to the germans the direct descent of the third reich from the old german empire however wilhelms wishes never to return to germany until the restoration of the monarchy were respected and the nazi occupation authorities granted him a small military funeral with a few hundred people present the mourners included august von mackensen fully dressed in his old imperial life hussars uniform admiral wilhelm canaris and reichskommissar for the netherlands arthur seyssinquart along with a few other military advisers however wilhelms request that the swastika and other nazi regalia be not displayed at his funeral was ignored and they are featured in the photographs of the event taken by a dutch photographer wilhelm was buried in a mausoleum in the grounds of huis doorn which has since become a place of pilgrimage for german monarchists small but enthusiastic and faithful numbers of them gather there every year on the anniversary of his death to pay their homage to the last german emperor historiography three trends have characterized the writing about wilhelm first the courtinspired writers considered him a martyr and a hero often uncritically accepting the justifications provided in the kaisers own memoirs second there came those who judged wilhelm to be completely unable to handle the great responsibilities of his position a ruler too reckless to deal with power third after  later scholars have sought to transcend the passions of the early th century and attempted an objective portrayal of wilhelm and his rule on  june  a year before the great war began the new york times published a special supplement devoted to the th anniversary of the kaisers coronation the banner headline read kaiser  years a ruler hailed as chief peacemaker the accompanying story called him the greatest factor for peace that our time can show and credited wilhelm with frequently rescuing europe from the brink of war until the late s the kaiser was depicted by most historians as a man of considerable influence partly that was a deception by german officials for example president theodore roosevelt believed the kaiser was in control of german foreign policy because hermann speck von sternburg the german ambassador in washington and a personal friend of roosevelt presented to the president messages from chancellor von bülow as messages from the kaiser later historians downplayed his role arguing that senior officials learned to work around him more recently historian john c g röhl has portrayed wilhelm as the key figure in understanding the recklessness and downfall of imperial germany thus the argument is made that the kaiser played a major role in promoting the policies of naval and colonial expansion that caused the sharp deterioration in germanys relations with britain before  first marriage and issue wilhelm and his first wife augusta viktoria wilhelm and his first wife princess augusta victoria of schleswigholstein were married on  february  they had seven

attractive and greatly enjoyed her company the couple were wed on  november  despite the objections of wilhelms monarchist supporters and his children hermines daughter princess henriette married the

victoria princess royal the eldest daughter of britains queen victoria at the time of his birth his greatuncle frederick william iv was king of prussia and his grandfather and namesake wilhelm was acting as regent he was the first grandchild of queen victoria and prince albert but more importantly as the first son of the crown prince of prussia wilhelm was from  second in the line of succession to prussia and also after  to the newly created german empire which according to the constitution of the german empire was ruled by the prussian king wilhelm with his father in highland dress in  a traumatic breech birth left him with a withered left arm due to erbs palsy which he tried with some success to conceal in many photos he carries a pair of white gloves in his left hand to make the arm seem longer holds his left hand with his right or has his crippled arm on the hilt of a sword or holding a cane to give the effect of a useful limb posed at a dignified angle his left arm was about  inches  centimetres shorter than his right arm historians have suggested that this disability affected his emotional developmentdubious – discuss early years in  wilhelm was taken to england to be present at the wedding of his uncle bertie later king edward vii and princess alexandra of denmark william attended the ceremony in a highland costume complete with a small toy dirk during the ceremony the fouryearold became restless his eighteenyearold uncle alfred duke of saxecoburg and gotha charged with keeping an eye on him told him to be quiet but wilhelm drew his dirk and threatened alfred when alfred attempted to subdue him by force wilhelm bit him on the leg his grandmother queen victoria missed seeing the fracas to her wilhelm remained a clever dear good little child the great favourite of my beloved vicky his mother vicky was obsessed with his damaged arm she blamed herself for the childs handicap and insisted that he become a good rider the thought that he as heir to the throne should not be able to ride was intolerable to her riding lessons began when wilhelm was eight and were a matter of endurance for wilhelm over and over the weeping prince was set on his horse and compelled to go through the paces he fell off time after time but despite his tears was set on its back again after weeks of this he finally got it right and was able to maintain his balance wilhelm from six years of age was tutored and heavily influenced by the yearold teacher georg hinzpeter hinzpeter he later wrote was really a good fellow whether he was the right tutor for me i dare not decide the torments inflicted on me in this pony riding must be attributed to my mother as a teenager he was educated at kassel at the friedrichsgymnasium in january  wilhelm finished high school and on his eighteenth birthday received as a present from his grandmother queen victoria the order of the garter after kassel he spent four terms at the university of bonn studying law and politics he became a member of the exclusive corps borussia bonn wilhelm possessed a quick intelligence but this was often overshadowed by a cantankerous temper prussian royalty house of hohenzollern wilhelm ii children crown prince wilhelm prince eitel friedrich prince adalbert prince august wilhelm prince oskar prince joachim victoria louise duchess of brunswick v t e as a scion of the royal house of hohenzollern wilhelm was exposed from an early age to the military society of the prussian aristocracy this had a major impact on him and in maturity wilhelm was seldom seen out of uniform the hypermasculine military culture of prussia in this period did much to frame his political ideals and personal relationships crown prince frederick was viewed by his son with a deeply felt love and respect his fathers status as a hero of the wars of unification was largely responsible for the young wilhelms attitude as were the circumstances in which he was raised close emotional contact between father and son was not encouraged later as he came into contact with the crown princes political opponents wilhelm came to adopt more ambivalent feelings toward his father perceiving the influence of wilhelms mother over a figure who should have been possessed of masculine independence and strength wilhelm also idolised his grandfather wilhelm i and he was instrumental in later attempts to foster a cult of the first german emperor as wilhelm the great however he had a distant relationship with his mother wilhelm resisted attempts by his parents especially his mother to educate him in british attitudes towards democracy instead he agreed with his german tutors support of autocratic rule and gradually became thoroughly prussianized under their influence he thus became alienated from his parents suspecting them of putting britains interests first the german emperor wilhelm i watched as his grandson guided principally by the crown princess victoria grew to manhood when wilhelm was nearing twentyone the emperor decided it was time his grandson should begin the military phase of his preparation for the throne he was assigned as a lieutenant to the first regiment of foot guards stationed at potsdam in the guards wilhelm said i really found my family my friends my interests — everything of which i had up to that time had to do without as a boy and a student his manner had been polite and agreeable as an officer he began to strut and speak brusquely in the tone he deemed appropriate for a prussian officer in many ways wilhelm was a victim of his inheritance and of otto von bismarcks machinations both sides of his family had suffered from mental illness and this may explain his emotional instabilitycitation needed when wilhelm was in his early twenties bismarck tried to separate him from his parents who opposed bismarck and his policies with some success bismarck planned to use the young prince as a weapon against his parents in order to retain his own political dominance wilhelm thus developed a dysfunctional relationship with his parents but especially with his english mother in an outburst in april  wilhelm angrily implied that an english doctor killed my father and an english doctor crippled my arm – which is the fault of my mother who allowed no german physicians to attend to herself or her immediate family as a young man wilhelm fell in love with one of his maternal first cousins princess elisabeth of hessedarmstadt she however turned him down and would in time marry into the russian imperial family in  however wilhelm became engaged to augusta victoria of schleswigholstein known as dona the couple married on  february  and would remain married for forty years until her death in  in a period of ten years between  and  augusta victoria would bear wilhelm seven children six sons and a daughter beginning in  bismarck began advocating that kaiser wilhelm send his grandson on various diplomatic missions a privilege denied to the crown prince that year prince wilhelm was sent to the court of tsar alexander iii of russia in st petersburg to attend the coming of age ceremony of the sixteenyearold tsarevich nicholas however wilhelms behavior did little to ingratiate himself to the tsar two years later kaiser wilhelm i took prince wilhelm on a trip to meet with the austrohungarian emperor franz joseph in  also thanks to herbert von bismarck the son of the chancellor prince wilhelm began to be trained twice a week at the foreign ministry one privilege was denied to prince wilhelm to represent germany at his maternal

wilhelms father was proclaimed emperor as frederick iii he was already suffering from an incurable throat cancer and spent all  days of his reign fighting the disease before dying on  june of that same year his yearold son succeeded him as german emperor and king of prussia although in his youth he had been a great admirer of otto von bismarck wilhelms characteristic impatience soon brought him into conflict with the iron chancellor the dominant figure in the foundation of his empire the new emperor opposed bismarcks careful foreign policy preferring vigorous and rapid expansion to protect germanys place in the sun furthermore the young emperor had come to the throne determined to rule as well as reign unlike his grandfather while the letter of the imperial constitution vested executive power in the emperor wilhelm i had been content to leave daytoday administration to bismarck early conflicts between wilhelm ii and his chancellor soon poisoned the relationship between the two men bismarck believed that wilhelm was a lightweight who could be dominated and he showed scant respect for wilhelms policies in the late s the final split between monarch and statesman occurred soon

majority in favour of his policies in the reichstag decided to make the antisocialist laws permanent his kartell the majority of the amalgamated conservative party and the national liberal party favoured making the laws permanent with one exception the police power to expel socialist agitators from their homes the kartell split over this issue and nothing was passed as the debate continued wilhelm became more and more interested in social problems especially the treatment of mine workers who went on strike in  he routinely interrupted bismarck in council to make clear where he stood on social policy bismarck sharply disagreed with wilhelms policy and worked to circumvent it wilhelm ii german emperor bismarck feeling pressured and unappreciated by the young emperor and undermined by his ambitious advisors refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with wilhelm as was required by the german constitution the final break came as bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority with his kartell voted from power due to the antisocialist bill fiasco the remaining powers in the reichstag were the catholic centre party and the conservative party bismarck wished to form a new bloc with the centre party and invited ludwig windthorst the partys parliamentary leader to discuss a coalition wilhelm was furious to hear about windthorsts visit in a parliamentary state the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to ensure his policies a majority but in germany the chancellor had to depend on the confidence of the emperor and wilhelm believed that the emperor had the right to be informed before his ministers meeting after a heated argument at bismarcks estate over imperial authority wilhelm stormed out bismarck forced for the first time into a situation he could not use to his advantage wrote a blistering letter of resignation decrying wilhelms interference in foreign and domestic policy which was published only after bismarcks death although bismarck had sponsored landmark social security legislation by – he had become disillusioned with the attitude of workers in particular he was opposed to wage increases improving working conditions and regulating labour relations moreover the kartell the shifting political coalition that bismarck had been able to forge since  had lost a working majority in the reichstag at the opening of the reichstag on  may  the kaiser stated that the most pressing issue was the further enlargement of the bill concerning the protection of the labourer in  the reichstag passed the workers protection acts which improved working conditions protected women and children and regulated labour relations dropping the pilot a

be succeeded as chancellor of germany and ministerpresident of prussia by leo von caprivi who in turn was replaced by chlodwig prince of hohenloheschillingsfürst in  following the dismissal of hohenlohe in  wilhelm appointed the man whom he regarded as his own bismarck bernhard von bülow in foreign policy bismarck had achieved a fragile balance of interests between germany france and russia—peace was at hand and bismarck tried to keep it that way despite growing popular sentiment against britain regarding colonies and especially against russia with bismarcks dismissal the russians now expected a reversal of policy in berlin so they quickly came to terms with france beginning the process that by  largely isolated germany monarchical styles of german emperor wilhelm ii king of prussia reference style his imperial and royal majesty spoken style your imperial and royal majesty alternative style sire in appointing caprivi and then hohenlohe wilhelm was embarking upon what is known to history as the new course in which he hoped to exert decisive influence in the government of the empire there is debate amongst historians as to the precise degree to which wilhelm succeeded in implementing personal rule in this era but what is clear is the very different dynamic which existed between the crown and its chief political servant the chancellor in the wilhelmine era these chancellors were senior civil servants and not seasoned politicianstatesmen like bismarck wilhelm wanted to preclude the emergence of another iron chancellor whom he ultimately detested as being a boorish old killjoy who had not permitted any minister to see the emperor except in his presence keeping a stranglehold on effective political power upon his enforced retirement and until his dying day bismarck was to become a bitter critic of wilhelms policies but without the support of the supreme arbiter of all political appointments the emperor there was little chance of bismarck exerting a decisive influence on policy silver mark coin of wilhelm ii something which bismarck was able to effect was the creation of the bismarck myth this was a view—which some would argue was confirmed by subsequent events—that with the dismissal of the iron chancellor wilhelm ii effectively destroyed any chance germany had of stable and effective government in this view wilhelms new course was characterised far more as the german ship of state going out of control eventually leading through a series of crises to the carnage of the first and second world wars in the early twentieth century wilhelm began to concentrate upon his real agenda the creation of a german navy that would rival that of britain and enable germany to declare itself a world power he ordered his military leaders to read admiral alfred thayer mahans book the influence of sea power upon history and spent hours drawing sketches of the ships that he wanted built bülow and bethmann hollweg his loyal chancellors looked after domestic affairs while wilhelm began to spread alarm in the chancellories of europe with his increasingly eccentric views on foreign affairs promoter of arts and sciences wilhelm enthusiastically promoted the arts and sciences as well as public education and social welfare he sponsored the kaiser wilhelm society for the promotion of scientific research it was funded by wealthy private donors and by the state and comprised a number of research institutes in both pure and applied sciences the prussian academy of sciences was unable to avoid the kaisers pressure and lost some of its autonomy when it was forced to incorporate new programs in engineering and award new fellowships in engineering sciences as a result of a gift from the kaiser in  wilhelm supported the modernisers as they tried to reform the prussian system of secondary education which was rigidly traditional elitist politically authoritarian and unchanged by the progress in the natural sciences as hereditary protector of the order of saint john he offered encouragement to the christian orders attempts to place german medicine at the forefront of modern medical practice through its system of hospitals nursing sisterhood and nursing schools and nursing homes throughout the german empire wilhelm continued as protector of the order even after  as the position was in essence attached to the head of the house of hohenzollern personality emperor wilhelm ii talks with ethiopians at the tierpark hagenbeck in hamburg in  historians have frequently stressed the role of wilhelms personality in shaping his reign thus thomas nipperdey concludes he was gifted with a quick understanding sometimes brilliant with a taste for the modern—technology industry science—but at the same time superficial hasty restless unable to relax without any deeper level of seriousness without any desire for hard work or drive to see things through to the end without any sense of sobriety for balance and boundaries or even for reality and real problems uncontrollable and scarcely capable of learning from experience desperate for applause and success—as bismarck said early on in his life he wanted every day to be his birthday—romantic sentimental and theatrical unsure and arrogant with an immeasurably exaggerated selfconfidence and desire to show off a juvenile cadet who never took the tone of the officers mess out of his voice and brashly wanted to play the part of the supreme warlord full of panicky fear of a monotonous life without any diversions and yet aimless pathological in his hatred against his english mother historian david fromkin states that wilhelm had a lovehate relationship with britain according to fromkin from the outset the halfgerman side of him was at war with the halfenglish side he was wildly jealous of the british wanting to be british wanting to be better at being british than the british were while at the same time hating them and resenting them because he never could be fully accepted by them langer et al  emphasize the negative international consequences of wilhelms erratic personality he believed in force and the survival of the fittest in domestic as well as foreign politics william was not lacking in intelligence but he did lack stability disguising his deep insecurities by swagger and tough talk he frequently fell into depressions and hysterics williams personal instability was reflected in vacillations of policy his actions at home as well as abroad lacked guidance and therefore often bewildered or infuriated public opinion he was not so much concerned with gaining specific objectives as had been the case with bismarck as with asserting his will this trait in the ruler of the leading continental power was one of the main causes of the uneasiness prevailing in europe at the turnofthecentury relationships with foreign relatives as a grandchild of queen victoria wilhelm was a first cousin of the british empires king george v as well as of queens marie of romania maud of wales and victoria eugenie of spain and of the empress alexandra of russia in  wilhelms younger sister sophia married the future king constantine i of greece wilhelm infuriated by his sisters conversion to greek orthodoxy upon her marriage attempted to ban her from entering germany the nine sovereigns at windsor for the funeral of king edward vii photographed on  may  standing from left to right king haakon vii of norway tsar ferdinand of the bulgarians king manuel ii of portugal and the algarve kaiser wilhelm ii of germany and prussia king george i of the hellenes and king albert i of the belgians seated from left to right king alfonso xiii of spain king george v of the united kingdom and king frederick viii of denmark wilhelms most contentious relationships were with his british relations he craved the acceptance of his grandmother queen victoria and of the rest of her family despite the fact that his grandmother treated him with courtesy and tact his other relatives found him arrogant and obnoxious and they largely denied him acceptance he had an especially bad relationship with his uncle bertie the prince of wales later king edward vii between  and  wilhelm resented his uncle himself a mere heir to the english throne treating wilhelm not as emperor of germany but merely as another nephew in turn wilhelm often snubbed his uncle whom he referred to as the old peacock and lorded his position as emperor over him beginning in the s wilhelm made visits to england for cowes week on the isle of wight and often competed against his uncle in the yacht races edwards wife the danishborn alexandra first as princess of wales and later as queen also disliked wilhelm never forgetting the prussian seizure of schleswigholstein from denmark in the s as well as being annoyed over wilhelms treatment of his mother despite his poor relations with his english relatives nevertheless when he received news that queen victoria was dying at osborne house in january  wilhelm traveled to england and was at her bedside when she died and remained for the funeral he also was present at the funeral of king edward vii in  in  wilhelm hosted a lavish wedding in berlin for his only daughter victoria louise among the guests at the wedding were tsar nicholas ii of russia who also disliked wilhelm and his english cousin king george v and his wife queen mary antisemitism wilhelms biographer lamar cecil identified wilhelms curious but welldeveloped antisemitism noting that in  a friend of wilhelm declared that the young kaisers dislike of his hebrew subjects one rooted in a perception that they possessed an overweening influence in germany was so strong that it could not be overcome cecil concludes wilhelm never changed and throughout his life he believed that jews were perversely responsible largely through their prominence in the berlin press and in leftist political movements for encouraging opposition to his rule for individual jews ranging from rich businessmen and major art collectors to purveyors of elegant goods in berlin stores he had considerable esteem but he prevented jewish citizens from having careers in the army and the diplomatic corps and frequently used abusive language against them on  december  wilhelm wrote to field marshal august von mackensen denouncing his own abdication as the deepest most disgusting shame ever perpetrated by a person in history the germans have done to themselves egged on and misled by the tribe of judah  let no german ever forget this nor rest until these parasites have been destroyed and exterminated from german soil wilhelm advocated a regular international allworlds pogrom à la russe as the best cure and further believed that

john bull walking off with marianne turning his back on wilhelm ii whose saber is shown extending from his coat wilhelm ii with nicholas ii of russia in  wearing the military uniforms of each others nations german foreign policy under wilhelm ii was faced with a number of significant problems perhaps the most apparent was that wilhelm was an impatient man subjective in his reactions and affected strongly by sentiment and impulse he was personally illequipped to steer german foreign policy along a rational course it is now widely recognised that the various spectacular acts which wilhelm undertook in the international sphere were often partially encouraged by the german foreign policy elite there were a number of notorious examples such as the kruger telegram of  in which wilhelm congratulated president paul kruger of the transvaal republic on the suppression of the british jameson raid thus alienating british public opinion british public opinion had been quite favourable toward the kaiser in his first twelve years on the throne but it turned sour in the late s during the first world war he became the central target of british antigerman propaganda and the personification of a hated enemy wilhelm invented and spread fears of a yellow peril trying to interest other european rulers in the perils they faced by invading china few other leaders paid attention wilhelm used the japanese victory in the russojapanese war to try and incite fear in the west of the yellow peril they faced by a resurgent japan which wilhelm claimed would ally with china to overrun the west under wilhelm germany invested in strengthening its colonies in africa and the pacific but few became profitable and all were lost during the first world war in south west africa now namibia a native revolt against german rule led to the herero and namaqua genocide although wilhelm eventually ordered it to be stopped one of the few times when wilhelm succeeded in personal diplomacy was when in  he supported the marriage of archduke franz ferdinand of austria to sophie chotek against the wishes of emperor franz joseph i of austria a domestic triumph for wilhelm was when his daughter victoria louise married the duke of brunswick in  this helped heal the rift between the house of hanover and the house of hohenzollern which followed the annexation of hanover by prussia

character the obligation to assist its citizens if they are being set upon in foreign lands the tasks that the old roman empire of the german nation was unable to accomplish the new german empire is in a position to fulfill the means that make this possible is our army it has been built up during thirty years of faithful peaceful labor following the principles of my blessed grandfather you too have received your training in accordance with these principles and by putting them to the test before the enemy you should see whether they have proved their worth in you your comrades in the navy have already passed this test they have shown that the principles of your training are sound and i am also proud of the praise that your comrades have earned over there from foreign leaders it is up to you to emulate them a great task awaits you you are to revenge the grievous injustice that has been done the chinese have overturned the law of nations they have mocked the sacredness of the envoy the duties of hospitality in a way unheard of in world history it is all the more outrageous that this crime has been committed by a nation that takes pride in its ancient culture show the old prussian virtue present yourselves as christians in the cheerful endurance of suffering may honor and glory follow your banners and arms give the whole world an example of manliness and discipline you know full well that you are to fight against a cunning brave wellarmed and cruel enemy when you encounter him know this no quarter will be given prisoners will not be taken exercise your arms such that for a thousand years no chinese will dare to look crosseyed at a german maintain discipline may god’s blessing be with you the prayers of an entire nation and my good wishes go with you each and every one open the way to civilization once and for all now you may depart farewell comrades the official version omitted the following passage from which the speech derives its name should you encounter the enemy he will be defeated no quarter will be given prisoners will not be taken whoever falls into your hands is forfeited just as a thousand years ago the huns under their king attila made a name for themselves one that even today makes them seem mighty in history and legend may the name german be affirmed by you in such a way in china that no chinese will ever again dare to look crosseyed at a german the term hun later became the favored epithet of allied antigerman war propaganda during the first world war moroccan crisis this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it november  one of wilhelms diplomatic blunders sparked the moroccan crisis of  when he made a spectacular visit to tangier in morocco his presence was seen as an assertion of german interests in morocco in opposition to those of france in his speech he even made remarks in favour of moroccan independence and this led to friction with france which had expanding colonial interests in morocco and to the algeciras conference which served largely to further isolate germany in europe wilhelm ii and winston churchill during a military autumn maneuver near breslau silesia wrocław poland in  daily telegraph affair main article daily telegraph affair wilhelms most damaging personal blunder cost him much of his prestige and power and had a far greater impact in germany than overseas the daily telegraph affair of  involved the publication in germany of an interview with a british daily newspaper that included wild statements and diplomatically damaging remarks wilhelm had seen the interview as an opportunity to promote his views and ideas on anglogerman friendship but due to his emotional outbursts during the course of the interview he ended up further alienating not only the british but also the french russians and japanese he implied among other things that the germans cared nothing for the british that the french and russians had attempted to incite germany to intervene in the second boer war and that the german naval buildup was targeted against the japanese not britain one memorable quotation from the interview was you english are mad mad mad as march hares the effect in germany was quite significant with serious calls for his abdication wilhelm kept a very low profile for many months after the daily telegraph fiasco but later exacted his revenge by forcing the resignation of the chancellor prince bülow who had abandoned the emperor to public scorn by not having the transcript edited before its german publication the daily telegraph crisis deeply wounded wilhelms previously unimpaired selfconfidence and he soon suffered a severe bout of depression from which he never fully recovered he lost much of the influence he had previously exercised in domestic and foreign policy naval expansion this section includes a list of references but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations please help to improve this section by

ludwig of bavaria nothing wilhelm did in the international arena was of more influence than his decision to pursue a policy of massive naval construction a powerful navy was wilhelms pet project he had inherited from his mother a love of the british royal navy which was at that time the worlds largest he once confided to his uncle the prince of wales that his dream was to have a fleet of my own some day wilhelms frustration over his fleets poor showing at the fleet review at his grandmother queen victorias diamond jubilee celebrations combined with his inability to exert german influence in south africa following the dispatch of the kruger telegram led to wilhelm taking definitive steps toward the construction of a fleet to rival that of his british cousins wilhelm was fortunate to be able to call on the services of the dynamic naval officer alfred von tirpitz whom he appointed to the head of the imperial naval office in  the new admiral had conceived of what came to be known as the risk theory or the tirpitz plan by which germany could force britain to accede to german demands in the international arena through the threat posed by a powerful battlefleet concentrated in the north sea tirpitz enjoyed wilhelms full support in his advocacy of successive naval bills of  and  by which the german navy was built up to contend with that of the british empire naval expansion under the fleet acts eventually led to severe financial strains in germany by  as by  wilhelm had committed his navy to construction of the much larger more expensive dreadnought type of battleship in  wilhelm reorganised top level control of the navy by creating a naval cabinet marinekabinett equivalent to the german imperial military cabinet which had previously functioned in the same capacity for both the army and navy the head of the naval cabinet was responsible for promotions appointments administration and issuing orders to naval forces captain gustav von sendenbibran was appointed as the first head and remained so until  the existing imperial admiralty was abolished and its responsibilities divided between two organisations a new position was created equivalent to the supreme commander of the army the chief of the high command of the admiralty or oberkommando der marine was responsible for ship deployments strategy and tactics viceadmiral max von der goltz was appointed in  and remained in post until  construction and maintenance of ships and obtaining supplies was the responsibility of the state secretary of the imperial navy office reichsmarineamt responsible to the imperial chancellor and advising the reichstag on naval matters the first appointee was rear admiral karl eduard heusner followed shortly by rear admiral friedrich von hollmann from  to  each of these three heads of department reported separately to wilhelm in addition to the expansion of the fleet the kiel canal was opened in  enabling faster movements between the north sea and the baltic sea

son crown prince wilhelm at prewar military maneuvers in autumn  a composite image of wilhelm ii with german generals the sarajevo crisis wilhelm was a friend of archduke franz ferdinand of austria and he was deeply shocked by his assassination on  june  wilhelm offered to support austriahungary in crushing the black hand the secret organization that had plotted the killing and even sanctioned the use of force by austria against the perceived source of the movement—serbia this is often called the blank cheque he wanted to remain in berlin until the crisis was resolved but his courtiers persuaded him instead to go on his annual cruise of the north sea on  july  wilhelm made erratic attempts to stay on top of the crisis via telegram and when the austrohungarian ultimatum was delivered to serbia he hurried back to berlin he reached berlin on  july read a copy of the serbian reply and wrote on it a brilliant solution—and in barely  hours this is more than could have been expected a great moral victory for vienna but with it every pretext for war falls to the ground and the ambassador giesl had better have stayed quietly at belgrade on this document i should never have given orders for mobilisation unknown to the emperor austrohungarian ministers and generals had already convinced the yearold franz joseph i of austria to sign a declaration of war against serbia as a direct consequence russia began a general mobilization to attack austria in defense of serbia july  main article july crisis emperor wilhelm in conversation with the victor of liège general otto von emmich in the background the generals hans von plessen middle and moriz von lyncker right on the night of  july when handed a document stating that russia would not cancel its mobilization wilhelm wrote a lengthy commentary containing these observations for i no longer have any doubt that england russia and france have agreed among themselves—knowing that our treaty obligations compel us to support austria—to use the austroserb conflict as a pretext for waging a war of annihilation against us our dilemma over keeping faith with the old and honourable emperor has been exploited to create a situation which gives england the excuse she has been seeking to annihilate us with a spurious appearance of justice on the pretext that she is helping france and maintaining the wellknown balance of power in europe ie playing off all european states for her own benefit against us more recent british authors state that wilhelm ii really declared ruthlessness and weakness will start the most terrifying war of the world whose purpose is to destroy germany because there can no longer be any doubts england france and russia have conspired themselves together to fight an annihilation war against us an das deutsche volk extract from wilhelms public address for mobilization  august  problems playing this file see media help when it became clear that germany would experience a war on two fronts and that britain would enter the war if germany attacked france through neutral belgium the panicstricken wilhelm attempted to redirect the main attack against russia when helmuth von moltke the younger who had chosen the old plan from  made by general von schlieffen for the possibility of german war on two fronts told him that this was impossible wilhelm said your uncle would have given me a different answer wilhelm is also reported to have said to think that george and nicky should have played me false if my grandmother had been alive she would never have allowed it in the original schlieffen plan germany would attack the supposed weaker enemy first meaning france the plan supposed that it would take a long time before russia was ready for war defeating france had been easy for prussia in the francoprussian war in  at the  border between france and germany an attack at this more southern part of france could be stopped by the french fortress along the border however wilhelm ii stopped any invasion of the netherlands italian poster from  showing wilhelm ii biting into the world the text reads the glutton – too hard shadowkaiser hindenburg wilhelm ii and ludendorff in january  wilhelms role in wartime was of everdecreasing power as he increasingly handled awards ceremonies and honorific duties the high command continued with its strategy even when it was clear that the schlieffen plan had failed by  the empire had effectively become a military dictatorship under the control of field marshal paul von hindenburg and general erich ludendorff increasingly cut off from reality and the political decisionmaking process wilhelm vacillated between defeatism and dreams of victory depending upon the fortunes of his armies nevertheless wilhelm still retained the ultimate authority in matters of political appointment and it was only after his consent had been gained that major changes to the high command could be effected wilhelm was in favour of the dismissal of helmuth von moltke the younger in september  and his replacement by erich von falkenhayn in  hindenburg and ludendorff decided that bethmanhollweg was no longer acceptable to them as chancellor and called upon the kaiser to appoint somebody else when asked whom they would accept ludendorff recommended georg michaelis a nonentity he barely knew the kaiser did not know michaelis but accepted the suggestion upon hearing in july  that his cousin george v had changed the name of the british royal house to windsor wilhelm remarked that he planned to see shakespeares play the merry wives of saxecoburggotha the kaisers support collapsed completely in october–november  in the army in the civilian government and in german public opinion as president woodrow wilson made clear the kaiser could no longer be a party to peace negotiations that year also saw wilhelm sickened during the worldwide  flu pandemic though he survived abdication and flight wikisource has original text related to this article statement of abdication wilhelm was at the imperial army headquarters in spa belgium when the uprisings in berlin and other centres took him by surprise in late  mutiny among the ranks of his beloved kaiserliche marine the imperial navy profoundly shocked him after the outbreak of the german revolution wilhelm could not make up his mind whether or not to abdicate up to that point he accepted that he would likely have to give up the imperial crown but still hoped to retain the prussian kingship however this was impossible under the imperial constitution while wilhelm thought he ruled as emperor in a personal union with prussia the constitution actually tied the imperial crown to the prussian crown meaning that wilhelm could not renounce one crown without renouncing the other wilhelms hopes of retaining at least one of his crowns was revealed as unrealistic when in the hope of preserving the monarchy in the face of growing revolutionary unrest chancellor prince max of baden announced wilhelms abdication of both titles on  november  prince max himself was forced to resign later the same day when it became clear that only friedrich ebert leader of the spd could effectively exert control later that day one of eberts secretaries of state ministers social democrat philipp scheidemann proclaimed germany a republic wilhelm consented to the abdication only after ludendorffs replacement general wilhelm groener had informed him that the officers and men of the army would march back in good order under paul von hindenburgs command but would certainly not fight for wilhelms throne on the home front the monarchys last and strongest support had been broken and finally even hindenburg himself a lifelong royalist was obliged with some embarrassment to advise the emperor to give up the crown the fact that the high command might one day abandon the kaiser had been foreseen in december  when wilhelm had visited otto von bismarck for the last time bismarck had again warned the kaiser about the increasing influence of militarists especially of the admirals who were pushing for the construction of a battle fleet bismarcks last warning had been your majesty so long as you have this present officer corps you can do as you please but when this is no longer the case it will be very different for you subsequently bismarck had predicted accurately jena came twenty years after the death of frederick the great the crash will come twenty years after my departure if things go on like this on  november wilhelm crossed the border by train and went into exile in the netherlands which had remained neutral throughout the war upon the conclusion of the treaty of versailles in early  article  expressly provided for the prosecution of wilhelm for a supreme offence against international morality and the sanctity of treaties but the dutch government refused to extradite him despite appeals from the allies king george v wrote that he looked on his cousin as the greatest criminal in history but opposed prime minister david lloyd georges proposal to hang the kaiser president woodrow wilson of the united states rejected extradition arguing that prosecuting wilhelm would destabilize international order and lose the peace wilhelm first settled in amerongen where on  november he issued a belated statement of abdication from both the prussian and imperial thrones thus formally ending the hohenzollerns year rule over prussia accepting the reality that he had lost both of his crowns for good he gave up his rights to the throne of prussia and to the german imperial throne connected therewith he also released his soldiers and officials in both prussia and the empire from their oath of loyalty to him he purchased a country house in the municipality of doorn known as huis doorn and moved in on  may  this was to be his home for the remainder of his life the weimar republic allowed wilhelm to remove twentythree railway wagons of furniture twentyseven containing packages of all sorts one bearing a car and another a boat from the new palace at potsdam life in exile in  wilhelm published the first volume of his memoirs—a very slim volume that insisted he was not guilty of initiating the great war and defended his conduct throughout his reign especially in matters of foreign policy for the remaining twenty years of his life he entertained guests often of some standing and kept himself updated on events in europe he grew a beard and allowed his famous moustache to droop he also learned the dutch language wilhelm developed a penchant for archaeology while residing at the corfu achilleion excavating at the site of the temple of artemis in corfu a passion he retained in his exile he had bought the former greek residence of empress elisabeth after her murder in  he also sketched plans for grand buildings and battleships when he was bored in exile one of wilhelms greatest passions was hunting and he bagged thousands of animals both beast and bird much of his time was spent chopping wood and thousands of trees were chopped down during his stay at doorn in the early s wilhelm apparently hoped that the successes of the german nazi party would stimulate interest in a restoration of the monarchy with his eldest grandson as the fourth kaiser his second wife hermine actively petitioned the nazi government on her husbands behalf however adolf hitler himself a veteran of the first world war like other leading nazis felt nothing but scorn for the man they blamed for germanys greatest defeat and the petitions were ignored though he played host to hermann göring at doorn on at least one occasion wilhelm grew to distrust hitler hearing of the murder of the wife of former chancellor schleicher he said we have ceased to live under the rule of law and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall wilhelm was also appalled at the kristallnacht of – november  saying i have just made my views clear to auwi wilhelms fourth son in the presence of his brothers he had the nerve to say that he agreed with the jewish pogroms and understood why they had come about when i told him that any decent man would describe these actions as gangsterisms he appeared totally indifferent he is completely lost to our family he also stated for the first time i am ashamed to be a german theres a man alone without family without children without god he builds legions but he doesnt build a nation a nation is created by families a religion traditions it is made up out of the hearts of mothers the wisdom of fathers the joy and the exuberance of children for a few months i was inclined to believe in national socialism i thought of it as a necessary fever and i was gratified to see that there were associated with it for a time some of the wisest and most outstanding germans but these one by one he has got rid of or even killed he has left nothing but a bunch of shirted gangsters this man could bring home victories to our people each year without bringing them either glory or danger but of our germany which was a nation of poets and musicians of artists and soldiers he has made a nation of hysterics and hermits engulfed in a mob and led by a thousand liars or fanatics ― wilhelm on hitler december  in the wake of the german victory over poland in september  wilhelms adjutant general von dommes wrote on his behalf to hitler stating that the house of hohenzollern remained loyal and noted that nine prussian princes one son and eight grandchildren were stationed at the front concluding because of the special circumstances that require residence in a neutral foreign country his majesty must personally decline to make the aforementioned comment the emperor has therefore charged me with making a communication wilhelm greatly admired the success which hitler was able to achieve in the opening months of the second world war and personally sent a congratulatory telegram when the netherlands surrendered in may  my fuhrer i congratulate you and hope that under your marvellous leadership the german monarchy will be restored completely hitler was reportedly exasperated and bemused and remarked to linge his valet what an idiot in another telegram to hitler upon the fall of paris a month later wilhelm stated congratulations you have won using my troops in a letter to his daughter victoria louise duchess of brunswick he wrote triumphantly thus is the pernicious entente cordiale of uncle edward vii brought to nought nevertheless after the nazi conquest of the netherlands in  the aging wilhelm retired completely from public life in may  when hitler invaded the netherlands wilhelm declined an offer from churchill of asylum in britain preferring to die at huis doorn during his last year at doorn wilhelm believed that germany was the land of monarchy and therefore of christ and that england was the land of liberalism and therefore of satan and the antichrist he argued that the english ruling classes were freemasons thoroughly infected by juda wilhelm asserted that the british people must be liberated from antichrist juda we must drive juda out of england just as he has been chased out of the continentclarification needed he believed the freemasons and jews had caused the two world wars aiming at a world jewish empire with british and american gold but that judas plan has been smashed to pieces and they themselves swept out of the european continent continental europe was now wilhelm wrote consolidating and closing itself off from british influences after the elimination of the british and the jews the end result would be a us of europeclarification needed in a letter of  to his sister princess margaret wilhelm wrote the hand of god is creating a new world  working miracles we are becoming the us of europe under german leadership a united european continent he added the jews are being thrust out of their nefarious positions in all countries whom they have driven to hostility for centuries also in  came what would have been his mothers th birthday on which he wrote ironically to a friend today the th birthday of my mother no notice is taken of it at home no memorial service or committee to remember her marvellous work for the welfare of our german people nobody of the new generation knows anything about her this sympathy for his mother is in sharp contrast to the intense animosity he expressed for her during most of her lifecitation needed the huis doorn in  wilhelm in  huis doorn in the netherlands death wilhelm iis tomb in doorn netherlands wilhelm died of a pulmonary embolus in doorn netherlands on  june  aged  just weeks before the axis invasion of the soviet union german soldiers had been guarding his house hitler however was reportedby whom to be angry that the former monarch had an honor guard of german troops and nearly fired the general who ordered them when he found out despite his personal animosity toward wilhelm hitler wanted to bring his body back to berlin for a state funeral as wilhelm was a symbol of germany and germans during the previous world war hitler felt that such a funeral would demonstrate to the germans the direct descent of the third reich from the old german empire however wilhelms wishes never to return to germany until the restoration of the monarchy were respected and the nazi occupation authorities granted him a small military funeral with a few hundred people present the mourners included august von mackensen fully dressed in his old imperial life hussars uniform admiral wilhelm canaris and reichskommissar for the netherlands arthur seyssinquart along with a few other military advisers however wilhelms request that the swastika and other nazi regalia be not displayed at his funeral was ignored and they are featured in the photographs of the event taken by a dutch photographer wilhelm was buried in a mausoleum in the grounds of huis doorn which has since become a place of pilgrimage for german monarchists small but enthusiastic and faithful numbers of them gather there every year on the anniversary of his death to pay their homage to the last german emperor historiography three trends have characterized the writing about wilhelm first the courtinspired writers considered him a martyr and a hero often uncritically accepting the justifications provided in the kaisers own memoirs second there came those who judged wilhelm to be completely unable to handle the great responsibilities of his position a ruler too reckless to deal with power third after  later scholars have sought to transcend the passions of the early th century and attempted an objective portrayal of wilhelm and his rule on  june  a year before the great war began the new york times published a special supplement devoted to the th anniversary of the kaisers coronation the banner headline read kaiser  years a ruler hailed as chief peacemaker the accompanying story called him the greatest factor for peace that our time can show and credited wilhelm with frequently rescuing europe from the brink of war until the late s the kaiser was depicted by most historians as a man of considerable influence partly that was a deception by german officials for example president theodore roosevelt believed the kaiser was in control of german foreign policy because hermann speck von sternburg the german ambassador in washington and a personal friend of roosevelt presented to the president messages from chancellor von bülow as messages from the kaiser later historians downplayed his role arguing that senior officials learned to work around him more recently historian john c g röhl has portrayed wilhelm as the key figure in understanding the recklessness and downfall of imperial germany thus the argument is made that the kaiser played a major role in promoting the policies of naval and colonial expansion that caused the sharp deterioration in germanys relations with britain before  first marriage and issue wilhelm and his first wife augusta viktoria wilhelm and his first wife

victoria princess royal the eldest daughter of britains queen victoria at the time of his birth his greatuncle frederick william iv was king of prussia and his grandfather and namesake wilhelm was acting as regent he was the first grandchild of queen victoria and prince albert but more importantly as the first son of the crown prince of prussia wilhelm was from  second in the line of succession to prussia and also after  to the newly created german empire which according to the constitution of the german empire was ruled by the prussian king wilhelm with his father in highland dress in  a traumatic breech birth left him with a withered left arm due to erbs palsy which he tried with some success to conceal in many photos he carries a pair of white gloves in his left hand to make the arm seem longer holds his left hand with his right or has his crippled arm on the hilt of a sword or holding a cane to give the effect of a useful limb posed at a dignified angle his left arm was about  inches  centimetres shorter than his right arm historians have suggested that this disability affected his emotional developmentdubious – discuss early years in  wilhelm was taken to england to be present at the wedding of his uncle bertie later king edward vii and princess alexandra of denmark william attended the ceremony in a highland costume complete with a small toy dirk during the ceremony the fouryearold became restless his eighteenyearold uncle alfred duke of saxecoburg and gotha charged with keeping an eye on him told him to be quiet but wilhelm drew his dirk and threatened alfred when alfred attempted to subdue him by force wilhelm bit him on the leg his grandmother queen victoria missed seeing the fracas to her wilhelm remained a clever dear good little child the great favourite of my beloved vicky his mother vicky was obsessed with his damaged arm she blamed herself for the childs handicap and insisted that he become a good rider the thought that he as heir to the throne should not be able to ride was intolerable to her riding lessons began when wilhelm was eight and were a matter of endurance for wilhelm over and over the weeping prince was set on his horse and compelled to go through the paces he fell off time after time but despite his tears was set on its back again after weeks of this he finally got it right and was able to maintain his balance wilhelm from six years of age was tutored and heavily influenced by the yearold teacher georg hinzpeter hinzpeter he later wrote was really a good fellow whether he was the right tutor for me i dare not decide the torments inflicted on me in this pony riding must be attributed to my mother as a teenager he was educated at kassel at the friedrichsgymnasium in january  wilhelm finished high school and on his eighteenth birthday received as a present from his grandmother queen victoria the order of the garter after kassel he spent four terms at the university of bonn studying law and politics he became a member of the exclusive corps borussia bonn wilhelm possessed a quick intelligence but this was often overshadowed by a cantankerous temper prussian royalty house of hohenzollern wilhelm ii children crown prince wilhelm prince eitel friedrich prince adalbert prince august wilhelm prince oskar prince joachim victoria louise duchess of brunswick v t e as a scion of the royal house of hohenzollern wilhelm was exposed from an early age to the military society of the prussian aristocracy this had a major impact on him and in maturity wilhelm was seldom seen out of uniform the hypermasculine military culture of prussia in this period did much to frame his political ideals and personal relationships crown prince frederick was viewed by his son with a deeply felt love and respect his fathers status as a hero of the wars of unification was largely responsible for the young wilhelms attitude as were the circumstances in which he was raised close emotional contact between father and son was not encouraged later as he came into contact with the crown princes political opponents wilhelm came to adopt more ambivalent feelings toward his father perceiving the influence of wilhelms mother over a figure who should have been possessed of masculine independence and strength wilhelm also idolised his grandfather wilhelm i and he was instrumental in later attempts to foster a cult of the first german emperor as wilhelm the great however he had a distant relationship with his mother wilhelm resisted attempts by his parents especially his mother to educate him in british attitudes towards democracy instead he agreed with his german tutors support of autocratic rule and gradually became thoroughly prussianized under their influence he thus became alienated from his parents suspecting them of putting britains interests first the german emperor wilhelm i watched as his grandson guided principally by the crown princess victoria grew to manhood when wilhelm was nearing twentyone the emperor decided it was time his grandson should begin the military phase of his preparation for the throne he was assigned as a lieutenant to the first regiment of foot guards stationed at potsdam in the guards wilhelm said i really found my family my friends my interests — everything of which i had up to that time had to do without as a boy and a student his manner had been polite and agreeable as an officer he began to strut and speak brusquely in the tone he deemed appropriate for a prussian officer in many ways wilhelm was a victim of his inheritance and of otto von bismarcks machinations both sides of his family had suffered from mental illness and this may explain his emotional instabilitycitation needed when wilhelm was in his early twenties bismarck tried to separate him from his parents who opposed bismarck and his policies with some success bismarck planned to use the young prince as a weapon against his parents in order to retain his own political dominance wilhelm thus developed a dysfunctional relationship with his parents but especially with his english mother in an outburst in april  wilhelm angrily implied that an english doctor killed my father and an english doctor crippled my arm – which is the fault of my mother who allowed no german physicians to attend to herself or her immediate family as a young man wilhelm fell in love with one of his maternal first cousins princess elisabeth of hessedarmstadt she however turned him down and would in time marry into the russian imperial family in  however wilhelm became engaged to augusta victoria of schleswigholstein known as dona the couple married on  february  and would remain married for forty years until her death in  in a period of ten years between  and  augusta victoria would bear wilhelm seven children six sons and a daughter beginning in  bismarck began advocating that kaiser wilhelm send his grandson on various diplomatic missions a privilege denied to the crown prince that year prince wilhelm was sent to the court of tsar alexander iii of russia in st petersburg to attend the coming of age ceremony of the sixteenyearold tsarevich nicholas however wilhelms behavior did little to ingratiate himself to the tsar two years later kaiser wilhelm i took prince wilhelm on a trip to meet with the austrohungarian emperor franz joseph in  also thanks to herbert von bismarck the son of the chancellor prince wilhelm began to be trained twice a week at the foreign ministry one privilege was denied to prince wilhelm to represent germany at his maternal

wilhelms father was proclaimed emperor as frederick iii he was already suffering from an incurable throat cancer and spent all  days of his reign fighting the disease before dying on  june of that same year his yearold son succeeded him as german emperor and king of prussia although in his youth he had been a great admirer of otto von bismarck wilhelms characteristic impatience soon brought him into conflict with the iron chancellor the dominant figure in the foundation of his empire the new emperor opposed bismarcks careful foreign policy preferring vigorous and rapid expansion to protect germanys place in the sun furthermore the young emperor had come to the throne determined to rule as well as reign unlike his grandfather while the letter of the imperial constitution vested executive power in the emperor wilhelm i had been content to leave daytoday administration to bismarck early conflicts between wilhelm ii and his chancellor soon poisoned the relationship between the two men bismarck believed that wilhelm was a lightweight who could be dominated and he showed scant respect for wilhelms policies in the late s the final split between monarch and statesman occurred soon

how and when to remove this template message the impetuous young kaiser says john c g röhl rejected bismarcks peaceful foreign policy and instead plotted with senior generals to work in favour of a war of aggression bismarck told an aide that young man wants war with russia and would like to draw his sword straight away if he could i shall not be a party to it bismarck after gaining an absolute majority in favour of his policies in the reichstag decided to make the antisocialist laws permanent his kartell the majority of the amalgamated conservative party and the national liberal party favoured making the laws permanent with one exception the police power to expel socialist agitators from their homes the kartell split over this issue and nothing was passed as the debate continued wilhelm became more and more interested in social problems especially the treatment of mine workers who went on strike in  he routinely interrupted bismarck in council to make clear where he stood on social policy bismarck sharply disagreed with wilhelms policy and worked to circumvent it wilhelm ii german emperor bismarck feeling pressured and unappreciated by the young emperor and undermined by his ambitious advisors refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with wilhelm as was required by the german constitution the final break came as bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority with his kartell voted from power due to the antisocialist bill fiasco the remaining powers in the reichstag were the catholic centre party and the conservative party bismarck wished to form a new bloc with the centre party and invited ludwig windthorst the partys parliamentary leader to discuss a coalition wilhelm was furious to hear about windthorsts visit in a parliamentary state the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to ensure his policies a majority but in germany the chancellor had to depend on the confidence of the emperor and wilhelm believed that the emperor had the right to be informed before his ministers meeting after a heated argument at bismarcks estate over imperial authority wilhelm stormed out bismarck forced for the first time into a situation he could not use to his advantage wrote a blistering letter of resignation decrying wilhelms interference in foreign and domestic policy which was published only after bismarcks death although bismarck had sponsored landmark social security legislation by – he had become disillusioned with the attitude of workers in particular he was opposed to wage increases improving working conditions and regulating labour relations moreover the kartell the shifting political coalition that bismarck had been able to forge since  had lost a working majority in the reichstag at the opening of the reichstag on  may  the kaiser stated that the most pressing issue was the further enlargement of the bill concerning the protection of the labourer in  the reichstag passed the workers protection acts which improved working conditions protected women and children and regulated labour relations dropping the pilot a famous caricature by sir john tenniel – first published in the british magazine punch  march  wilhelm in control dismissal of bismarck bismarck resigned at wilhelm iis insistence in  at the age of  to be succeeded as chancellor of germany and ministerpresident of prussia by leo von caprivi who in turn was replaced by chlodwig prince of hohenloheschillingsfürst in  following the dismissal of hohenlohe in  wilhelm appointed the man whom he regarded as his own bismarck bernhard von bülow in foreign policy bismarck had achieved a fragile balance of interests between germany france and russia—peace was at hand and bismarck tried to keep it that way despite growing popular sentiment against britain regarding colonies and especially against russia with bismarcks dismissal the russians now expected a reversal of policy in berlin so they quickly came to terms with france beginning the process that by  largely isolated germany monarchical styles of german emperor wilhelm ii king of prussia reference style his imperial and royal majesty spoken style your imperial and royal majesty alternative style sire in appointing caprivi and then hohenlohe wilhelm was embarking upon what is known to history as the new course in which he hoped to exert decisive influence in the government of the empire there is debate amongst historians as to the precise degree to which wilhelm succeeded in implementing personal rule in this era but what is clear is the very different dynamic which existed between the crown and its chief political servant the chancellor in the wilhelmine era these chancellors were senior civil servants and not seasoned politicianstatesmen like bismarck wilhelm wanted to preclude the emergence of another iron chancellor whom he ultimately detested as being a boorish old killjoy who had not permitted any minister to see the emperor except in his presence keeping a stranglehold on effective political power upon his enforced retirement and until his dying day bismarck was to become a bitter critic of wilhelms policies but without the support of the supreme arbiter of all political appointments the emperor there was little chance of bismarck exerting a decisive influence on policy silver mark coin of wilhelm ii something which bismarck was able to effect was the creation of the bismarck myth this was a view—which some would argue was confirmed by subsequent events—that with the dismissal of the iron chancellor wilhelm ii effectively destroyed any chance germany had of stable and effective government in this view wilhelms new course was characterised far more as the german ship of state going out of control eventually leading through a series of crises to the carnage of the first and second world wars in the early twentieth century wilhelm began to concentrate upon his real agenda the creation of a german navy that would rival that of britain and enable germany to declare itself a world power he ordered his military leaders to read admiral alfred thayer mahans book the influence of sea power upon history and spent hours drawing sketches of the ships that he wanted built bülow and bethmann hollweg his loyal chancellors looked after domestic affairs while wilhelm began to spread alarm in the chancellories of europe with his increasingly eccentric views on foreign affairs promoter of arts and sciences wilhelm enthusiastically promoted the arts and sciences as well as public education and social welfare he sponsored the kaiser wilhelm society for the promotion of scientific research it was funded by wealthy private donors and by the state and comprised a number of research institutes in both pure and applied sciences the prussian academy of sciences was unable to avoid the kaisers pressure and lost some of its autonomy when it was forced to incorporate new programs in engineering and award new fellowships in engineering sciences as a result of a gift from the kaiser in  wilhelm supported the modernisers as they tried to reform the prussian system of secondary education which was rigidly traditional elitist politically authoritarian and unchanged by the progress in the natural sciences as hereditary protector of the order of saint john he offered encouragement to the christian orders attempts to place german medicine at the forefront of modern medical practice through its system of hospitals nursing sisterhood and nursing schools and nursing homes throughout the german empire wilhelm continued as protector of the order even after  as the position was in essence attached to the head of the house of hohenzollern personality emperor wilhelm ii talks with ethiopians at the tierpark hagenbeck in hamburg in  historians have frequently stressed the role of wilhelms personality in shaping his reign thus thomas nipperdey concludes he was gifted with a quick understanding sometimes brilliant with a taste for the modern—technology industry science—but at the same time superficial hasty restless unable to relax without any deeper level of seriousness without any desire for hard work or drive to see things through to the end without any sense of sobriety for balance and boundaries or even for reality and real problems uncontrollable and scarcely capable of learning from experience desperate for applause and success—as bismarck said early on in his life he wanted every day to be his birthday—romantic sentimental and theatrical unsure and arrogant with an immeasurably exaggerated selfconfidence and desire to show off a juvenile cadet who never took the tone of the officers mess out of his voice and brashly wanted to play the part of the supreme warlord full of panicky fear of a monotonous life without any diversions and yet aimless pathological in his hatred against his english mother historian david fromkin states that wilhelm had a lovehate relationship with britain according to fromkin from the outset the halfgerman side of him was at war with the halfenglish side he was wildly jealous of the british wanting to be british wanting to be better at being british than the british were while at the same time hating them and resenting them because he never could be fully accepted by them langer et al  emphasize the negative international consequences of wilhelms erratic personality he believed in force and the survival of the fittest in domestic as well as foreign politics william was not lacking in intelligence but he did lack stability disguising his deep insecurities by swagger and tough talk he frequently fell into depressions and hysterics williams personal instability was reflected in vacillations of policy his actions at home as well as abroad lacked guidance and therefore often bewildered or infuriated public opinion he was not so much concerned with gaining specific objectives as had been the case with bismarck as with asserting his will this trait in the ruler of the leading continental power was one of the main causes of the uneasiness prevailing in europe at the turnofthecentury relationships with foreign relatives as a grandchild of queen victoria wilhelm was a first cousin of the british empires king george v as well as of queens marie of romania maud of wales and victoria eugenie of spain and of the empress alexandra of russia in  wilhelms younger sister sophia married the future king constantine i of greece wilhelm infuriated by his sisters conversion to greek orthodoxy upon her marriage attempted to ban her from entering germany the nine sovereigns at windsor for the funeral of king edward

king george i of the hellenes and king albert i of the belgians seated from left to right king alfonso xiii of spain king george v of the united kingdom and king frederick viii of denmark wilhelms most contentious relationships were with his british relations he craved the acceptance of his grandmother queen victoria and of the rest of her family despite the fact that his grandmother treated him with courtesy and tact his other relatives found him arrogant and obnoxious and they largely denied him acceptance he had an especially bad relationship with his uncle bertie the prince of wales later king edward vii between  and  wilhelm resented his uncle himself a mere heir to the english throne treating wilhelm not as emperor of germany but merely as another nephew in turn wilhelm often snubbed his uncle whom he referred to as the old peacock and lorded his position as emperor over him beginning in the s wilhelm made visits to england for cowes week on the isle of wight and often competed against his uncle in the yacht races edwards wife the danishborn alexandra first as princess of wales and later as queen also disliked wilhelm never forgetting the prussian seizure of schleswigholstein from denmark in the s as well as being annoyed over wilhelms treatment of his mother despite his poor relations with his english relatives nevertheless when he received news that queen victoria was dying at osborne house in january  wilhelm traveled to england and was at her bedside when she died and remained for the funeral he also was present at the funeral of king edward vii in  in  wilhelm hosted a lavish wedding in berlin for his only daughter victoria louise among the guests at the wedding were tsar nicholas ii of russia who also disliked wilhelm and his english cousin king george v and his wife queen mary antisemitism wilhelms biographer lamar cecil identified wilhelms curious but welldeveloped antisemitism noting that in  a friend of wilhelm declared that the young kaisers dislike of his hebrew subjects one rooted in a perception that they possessed an overweening influence in germany was so strong that it could not be overcome cecil concludes wilhelm never changed and throughout his life he believed that jews were perversely responsible largely through their prominence in the berlin press and in leftist political movements for encouraging opposition to his rule for individual jews ranging from rich businessmen and major art collectors to purveyors of elegant goods in berlin stores he had considerable esteem but he prevented jewish citizens from having careers in the army and the diplomatic corps and frequently used abusive language against them on  december  wilhelm wrote to field marshal august von mackensen denouncing his own abdication as the deepest most disgusting shame ever perpetrated by a person in history the germans have done to themselves egged on and misled by the tribe of judah  let no german ever forget this nor rest until these parasites have been destroyed and exterminated from german soil wilhelm advocated a regular international allworlds pogrom à la russe as the best cure and further believed that

john bull walking off with marianne turning his back on wilhelm ii whose saber is shown extending from his coat wilhelm ii with nicholas ii of russia in  wearing the military uniforms of each others nations german foreign policy under wilhelm ii was faced with a number of significant problems perhaps the most apparent was that wilhelm was an impatient man subjective in his reactions and affected strongly by sentiment and impulse he was personally illequipped to steer german foreign policy along a rational course it is now widely recognised that the various spectacular acts which wilhelm undertook in the international sphere were often partially encouraged by the german foreign policy elite there were a number of notorious examples such as the kruger telegram of  in which wilhelm congratulated president paul kruger of the transvaal republic on the suppression of the british jameson raid thus alienating british public opinion british public opinion had been quite favourable toward the kaiser in his first twelve years on the throne but it turned sour in the late s during the first world war he became the central target of british antigerman propaganda and the personification of a hated enemy wilhelm invented and spread fears of a yellow peril trying to interest other european rulers in the perils they faced by invading china few other leaders paid attention wilhelm used the japanese victory in the russojapanese war to try and incite fear in the west of the yellow peril they faced by a resurgent japan which wilhelm claimed would ally with china to overrun the west under wilhelm germany invested in strengthening its colonies in africa and the pacific but few became profitable and all were lost during the first world war in south west africa now namibia a native revolt against german rule led to the herero and namaqua genocide although wilhelm eventually ordered it to be stopped one of the few times when wilhelm succeeded in personal diplomacy was when in  he supported the marriage of archduke franz ferdinand of austria to sophie chotek against the wishes of emperor franz joseph i of austria a domestic triumph for wilhelm was when

late arrival was made worse by the kaisers illconceived farewell address in which he commanded them in the spirit of the huns to be merciless in battle wilhelm delivered this speech in bremerhaven on  july  addressing german troops who were departing to suppress the boxer rebellion in china the speech was infused with wilhelms fiery and chauvinistic rhetoric and clearly expressed his vision of german imperial power there were two versions of the speech the foreign office issued an edited version making sure to omit one particularly incendiary paragraph that they regarded as diplomatically embarrassing the edited version read like this great overseas tasks have fallen to the new german empire tasks far greater than many of my countrymen expected the german empire has by its very character the obligation to assist its citizens if they are being set upon in foreign lands the tasks that the old roman empire of the german nation was unable to accomplish the new german empire is in a position to fulfill the means that make this possible is our army it has been built up during thirty years of faithful peaceful labor following the principles of my blessed grandfather you too have received your training in accordance with these principles and by putting them to the test before the enemy you should see whether they have proved their worth in you your comrades in the navy

daily telegraph affair main article daily telegraph affair wilhelms most damaging personal blunder cost him much of his prestige and power and had a far greater impact in germany than overseas the daily telegraph affair of  involved the publication in germany of an interview with a british daily newspaper that included wild statements and diplomatically damaging remarks wilhelm had seen the interview as an opportunity to promote his views and ideas on anglogerman friendship but due to his emotional outbursts during the course of the interview he ended up further alienating not only the british but also the french russians and japanese he implied among other things that the germans cared nothing for the british that the french and russians had attempted to incite germany to intervene in the second boer war and that the german naval buildup was targeted against the japanese not britain one memorable quotation from the interview was you english are mad mad mad as march hares the effect in germany was quite significant with serious calls for his abdication wilhelm kept a very low profile for many months after the daily telegraph fiasco but later exacted his revenge by forcing the resignation of the chancellor prince bülow who had abandoned the emperor to public scorn by not having the transcript edited before its german publication the daily telegraph crisis deeply wounded wilhelms previously unimpaired selfconfidence and he soon suffered a severe bout of depression from which he never fully recovered he lost much of the influence he had previously exercised in domestic

some day wilhelms frustration over his fleets poor showing at the fleet review at his grandmother queen victorias diamond jubilee celebrations combined with his inability to exert german influence in south africa following the dispatch of the kruger telegram led to wilhelm taking definitive steps toward the construction of a fleet to rival that of his british cousins wilhelm was fortunate to be able to call on the services of the dynamic naval officer alfred von tirpitz whom he appointed to the head of the imperial naval office in  the new admiral had conceived of what came to be known as the risk theory or the tirpitz plan by which germany could force britain to accede to german demands in the international arena through the threat posed by a powerful battlefleet concentrated in the north sea tirpitz enjoyed wilhelms full support in his advocacy of successive naval bills of  and  by which the german navy was built up to contend with that of the british empire naval expansion

january  wilhelms role in wartime was of everdecreasing power as he increasingly handled awards ceremonies and honorific duties the high command continued with its strategy even when it was clear that the schlieffen plan had failed by  the empire had effectively become a military dictatorship under the control of field marshal paul von hindenburg and general erich ludendorff increasingly cut off from reality and the political decisionmaking process wilhelm vacillated between defeatism and dreams of victory depending upon the fortunes of his armies nevertheless wilhelm still retained the ultimate authority in matters of political appointment and it was only after his consent had been gained that major changes to the high command could be effected wilhelm was in favour of the dismissal of helmuth von moltke the younger in september  and his replacement by erich von falkenhayn in  hindenburg and ludendorff decided that bethmanhollweg was no longer acceptable to them as chancellor and called upon the kaiser to appoint somebody else when asked whom they would accept ludendorff recommended georg michaelis a nonentity he barely knew the kaiser did not know michaelis but accepted the suggestion upon hearing in july  that his cousin george v had changed the name of the british royal house to windsor wilhelm remarked that he planned to see shakespeares play the merry wives of saxecoburggotha the kaisers support collapsed completely in october–november  in the army in the civilian government and in german public opinion as president woodrow wilson made clear the kaiser

this article statement of abdication wilhelm was at the imperial army headquarters in spa belgium when the uprisings in berlin and other centres took him by surprise in late  mutiny among the ranks of his beloved kaiserliche marine the imperial navy profoundly shocked him after the outbreak of the german revolution wilhelm could not make up his mind whether or not to abdicate up to that point he accepted that he would likely have to give up the imperial crown but still hoped to retain the prussian kingship however this was impossible under the imperial constitution while wilhelm thought he ruled as emperor in a personal union with prussia the constitution actually tied the imperial crown to the prussian crown meaning that wilhelm could not renounce one crown without renouncing the other wilhelms hopes of retaining at least one of his crowns was revealed as unrealistic when in the hope of preserving the monarchy in the face of growing revolutionary unrest chancellor prince max of baden announced wilhelms abdication of both titles on  november  prince max himself was forced to resign later the same day when it became clear that only friedrich ebert leader of the spd could effectively exert control later that day one of eberts secretaries of state ministers social democrat philipp scheidemann proclaimed germany a republic wilhelm consented to the abdication only after ludendorffs replacement general wilhelm groener had informed him that the officers and men of the army would march back in good order under paul von hindenburgs command but would certainly not fight for wilhelms throne on the home front the monarchys last and strongest support had been broken and finally even hindenburg himself a lifelong royalist was obliged with some embarrassment to advise the emperor to give up the crown the fact that the high command might one day abandon the kaiser had been foreseen in december  when wilhelm had visited otto von bismarck for the last time bismarck had again warned the kaiser about the increasing influence of militarists especially of the admirals who were pushing for the construction of a battle fleet bismarcks last warning had been your majesty so long as you have this present officer corps you can do as you please but when this is no longer the case it will be very different for you subsequently bismarck had predicted accurately jena came twenty years after the death of frederick the great the crash will come twenty years after my departure if things go on like this on  november wilhelm crossed the border by train and went into exile in the netherlands which had remained neutral throughout the war upon the conclusion of the treaty of versailles in early  article  expressly provided for the prosecution of wilhelm for a supreme offence against international morality and the sanctity of treaties but the dutch government refused to extradite him despite appeals from the allies king george v wrote that he looked on his cousin as the greatest criminal in history but opposed prime minister david lloyd georges proposal to hang the kaiser president woodrow wilson of the united states rejected extradition arguing that prosecuting wilhelm would destabilize international order and lose the peace wilhelm first settled in amerongen where on  november he issued a belated statement of abdication from both the prussian and imperial thrones thus formally ending the hohenzollerns year rule over prussia accepting the reality that he had lost both of his crowns for good he gave up his rights to the throne of prussia and to the german imperial throne connected therewith he also released his soldiers and officials in both prussia and the empire from their oath of loyalty to him he purchased a country house in the municipality of doorn known as huis doorn and moved in on  may  this was to be his home for the remainder of his life the weimar republic allowed wilhelm to remove twentythree railway wagons of furniture twentyseven containing packages of all sorts one bearing a car and another a boat from the new palace at potsdam life in exile in  wilhelm published the first volume of his memoirs—a very slim volume that insisted he was not guilty of initiating the great war and defended his conduct throughout his reign especially in matters of foreign policy for the remaining twenty years of his life he entertained guests often of some standing and kept himself updated on events in europe he grew a beard and allowed his famous moustache to droop he also learned the dutch language wilhelm developed a penchant for archaeology while residing at the corfu achilleion excavating at the site of the temple of artemis in corfu a passion he retained in his exile he had bought the former greek residence of empress elisabeth after her murder in  he also sketched plans for grand buildings and battleships when he was bored in exile one of wilhelms greatest passions was hunting and he bagged thousands of animals both beast and bird much of his time was spent chopping wood and thousands of trees were chopped down during his stay at doorn in the early s wilhelm apparently hoped that the successes of the german nazi party would stimulate interest in a restoration of the monarchy with his eldest grandson as the fourth kaiser his second wife hermine actively petitioned the nazi government on her husbands behalf however adolf hitler himself a veteran of the first world war like other leading nazis felt nothing but scorn for the man they blamed for germanys greatest defeat and the petitions were ignored though he played host to hermann göring at doorn on at least one occasion wilhelm grew to distrust hitler hearing of the murder of the wife of former chancellor schleicher he said we have ceased to live under the rule of law and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall wilhelm was also appalled at the kristallnacht of – november  saying i have just made my views clear to auwi wilhelms fourth son in the presence of his brothers he had the nerve to say that he agreed with the jewish pogroms and understood why they had come about when i told him that any decent man would describe these actions as gangsterisms he appeared totally indifferent he is completely lost to our family he also stated for the first time i am ashamed to be a german theres a man alone without family without children without god he builds legions but he doesnt build a nation a nation is created by families a religion traditions it is made up out of the hearts of mothers the wisdom of fathers the joy and the exuberance of children for a few months i was inclined to believe in national socialism i thought of it as a necessary fever and i was gratified to see that there were associated with it for a time some of the wisest and most outstanding germans but these one by one he has got rid of or even killed he has left nothing but a bunch of shirted gangsters this man could bring home victories to our people each year without bringing them either glory or danger but of our germany which was a nation of poets and musicians of artists and soldiers he has made a nation of hysterics and hermits engulfed in a mob and led by a thousand liars or fanatics ― wilhelm on hitler december  in the wake of the german victory over poland in september  wilhelms adjutant general von dommes wrote on his behalf to hitler stating that the house of hohenzollern remained loyal and noted that nine prussian princes one son and eight grandchildren were stationed at the front concluding because of the special circumstances that require residence in a neutral foreign country his majesty must personally decline to make the aforementioned comment the emperor has therefore charged me with making a communication wilhelm greatly admired the success which hitler was able to achieve in the opening months of the second world war and personally sent a congratulatory telegram when the netherlands surrendered in may  my fuhrer i congratulate you and hope that under your marvellous leadership the german monarchy will be restored completely hitler was reportedly exasperated and bemused and remarked to linge his valet what an idiot in another telegram to hitler upon the fall of paris a month later wilhelm stated congratulations you have won using my troops in a letter to his daughter victoria louise duchess of brunswick he wrote triumphantly thus is the pernicious entente cordiale of uncle edward vii brought to nought nevertheless after the nazi conquest of the netherlands in  the aging wilhelm retired completely from public life in may  when hitler invaded the netherlands wilhelm declined an offer from churchill of asylum in britain preferring to die at huis doorn during his last year at doorn wilhelm believed that germany was the land of monarchy and therefore of christ and that england was the land of liberalism and therefore of satan and the antichrist he argued that the english ruling classes were freemasons thoroughly infected by juda wilhelm asserted that the british people must be liberated from antichrist juda we must drive juda out of england just as he has been chased out of the continentclarification needed he believed the freemasons and jews had caused the two world wars aiming at a world jewish empire with british and american gold but that judas plan has been smashed to pieces and they themselves swept out of the european continent continental europe was now wilhelm wrote consolidating and closing itself off from british influences after the elimination of the british and the jews the end result would be a us of europeclarification needed in a letter of  to his sister princess margaret wilhelm wrote the hand of god is creating a new world  working miracles we are becoming the us of europe under german leadership a united european continent he added the jews are being thrust out of their nefarious positions in all countries whom they have driven to hostility for centuries also in  came what would have been his mothers th birthday on which he wrote ironically to a friend today the th birthday of my mother no notice is taken of it at home no memorial service or committee to remember her marvellous work for the welfare of our german people nobody

the soviet union german soldiers had been guarding his house hitler however was reportedby whom to be angry that the former monarch had an honor guard of german troops and nearly fired the general who ordered them when he found out despite his personal animosity toward wilhelm hitler wanted to bring his body back to berlin for a state funeral as wilhelm was a symbol of germany and germans during the previous world war hitler felt that such a funeral would demonstrate to the germans the direct descent of the third reich from the old german empire however wilhelms wishes never to return to germany until the restoration of the monarchy were respected and the nazi occupation authorities granted him a small military funeral with a few hundred people present the mourners included august von mackensen fully dressed in his old imperial life hussars uniform admiral wilhelm canaris and reichskommissar for the netherlands arthur seyssinquart along with a few other military advisers however wilhelms request that the swastika and other nazi regalia be not displayed at his funeral was ignored and they are featured in the photographs of the event taken by a dutch photographer wilhelm was buried in a mausoleum in the grounds of huis doorn which has since become a place of pilgrimage for german monarchists small but enthusiastic and faithful numbers of them gather there every year on the anniversary of his death to pay their homage to the last german emperor historiography three trends have characterized the writing about wilhelm first the courtinspired writers considered him a martyr and a hero often uncritically accepting the justifications provided in the kaisers own memoirs second there came those who judged wilhelm to be completely unable to handle the great responsibilities of his position a ruler too reckless to deal with power third after  later scholars have sought to transcend the passions of the early th century and attempted an objective portrayal of wilhelm and his rule on  june  a year before the great war began the new york times published a special supplement devoted to the th anniversary of the kaisers coronation the banner headline read kaiser  years a ruler hailed as chief peacemaker the accompanying story called him the greatest factor for peace that our time can show and credited wilhelm with frequently rescuing europe from the brink of war until the late s the kaiser was depicted by most historians as a man of considerable influence partly that was a deception by german officials for example president theodore roosevelt believed the kaiser was in control of german foreign policy because hermann speck von sternburg the german ambassador in washington and a personal friend of roosevelt presented to the president messages from chancellor von bülow as messages from the kaiser later historians downplayed his role arguing that senior officials learned to work around him more recently historian john c g röhl has portrayed wilhelm as the key figure in understanding the recklessness and downfall of imperial germany thus the argument is made that the kaiser played a major role in promoting the policies of naval and colonial expansion that caused the sharp deterioration in germanys relations with britain before  first marriage and issue wilhelm and his first wife augusta viktoria wilhelm and his first wife

victoria princess royal the eldest daughter of britains queen victoria at the time of his birth his greatuncle frederick william iv was king of prussia and his grandfather and namesake wilhelm was acting as regent he was the first grandchild of queen victoria and prince albert but more importantly as the first son of the crown prince of prussia wilhelm was from  second in the line of succession to prussia and also after  to the newly created german empire which according to the constitution of the german empire was ruled by the prussian king wilhelm with his father in highland dress in  a traumatic breech birth left him with a withered left arm due to erbs palsy which he tried with some success to conceal in many photos he carries a pair of white gloves in his left hand to make the arm seem longer holds his left hand with his right or has his crippled arm on the hilt of a sword or holding a cane to give the effect of a useful limb posed at a dignified angle his left arm was about  inches  centimetres shorter than his right arm historians have suggested that this disability affected his emotional developmentdubious – discuss early years in  wilhelm was taken to england to be present at the wedding of his uncle bertie later king edward vii and princess alexandra of denmark william attended the ceremony in a highland costume complete with a small toy dirk during the ceremony the fouryearold became restless his eighteenyearold uncle alfred duke of saxecoburg and gotha charged with keeping an eye on him told him to be quiet but wilhelm drew his dirk and threatened alfred when alfred attempted to subdue him by force wilhelm bit him on the leg his grandmother queen victoria missed seeing the fracas to her wilhelm remained a clever dear good little child the great favourite of my beloved vicky his mother vicky was obsessed with his damaged arm she blamed herself for the childs handicap and insisted that he become a good rider the thought that he as heir to the throne should not be able to ride was intolerable to her riding lessons began when wilhelm was eight and were a matter of endurance for wilhelm over and over the weeping prince was set on his horse and compelled to go through the paces he fell off time after time but despite his tears was set on its back again after weeks of this he finally got it right and was able to maintain his balance wilhelm from six years of age was tutored and heavily influenced by the yearold teacher georg hinzpeter hinzpeter he later wrote was really a good fellow whether he was the right tutor for me i dare not decide the torments inflicted on me in this pony riding must be attributed to my mother as a teenager he was educated at kassel at the friedrichsgymnasium in january  wilhelm finished high school and on his eighteenth birthday received as a present from his grandmother queen victoria the order of the garter after kassel he spent four terms at the university of bonn studying law and politics he became a member of the exclusive corps borussia bonn wilhelm possessed a quick intelligence but this was often overshadowed by a cantankerous temper prussian royalty house of hohenzollern wilhelm ii children crown prince wilhelm prince eitel friedrich prince adalbert prince august wilhelm prince oskar prince joachim victoria louise duchess of brunswick v t e as a scion of the royal house of hohenzollern wilhelm was exposed from an early age to the military society of the prussian aristocracy this had a major impact on him and in maturity wilhelm was seldom seen out of uniform the hypermasculine military culture of prussia in this period did much to frame his political ideals and personal relationships crown prince frederick was viewed by his son with a deeply felt love and respect his fathers status as a hero of the wars of unification was largely responsible for the young wilhelms attitude as were the circumstances in which he was raised close emotional contact between father and son was not encouraged later as he came into contact with the crown princes political opponents wilhelm came to adopt more ambivalent feelings toward his father perceiving the influence of wilhelms mother over a figure who should have been possessed of masculine independence and strength wilhelm also idolised his grandfather wilhelm i and he was instrumental in later attempts to foster a cult of the first german emperor as wilhelm the great however he had a distant relationship with his mother wilhelm resisted attempts by his parents especially his mother to educate him in british attitudes towards democracy instead he agreed with his german tutors support of autocratic rule and gradually became thoroughly prussianized under their influence he thus became alienated from his parents suspecting them of putting britains interests first the german emperor wilhelm i watched as his grandson guided principally by the crown princess victoria grew to manhood when wilhelm was nearing twentyone the emperor decided it was time his grandson should begin the military phase of his preparation for the throne he was assigned as a lieutenant to the first regiment of foot guards stationed at potsdam in the guards wilhelm said i really found my family my friends my interests — everything of which i had up to that time had to do without as a boy and a student his manner had been polite and agreeable as an officer he began to strut and speak brusquely in the tone he deemed appropriate for a prussian officer in many ways wilhelm was a victim of his inheritance and of otto von bismarcks machinations both sides of his family had suffered from mental illness and this may explain his emotional instabilitycitation needed when wilhelm was in his early twenties bismarck tried to separate him from his parents who opposed bismarck and his policies with some success bismarck planned to use the young prince as a weapon against his parents in order to retain his own political dominance wilhelm thus developed a dysfunctional relationship with his parents but especially with his english mother in an outburst in april  wilhelm angrily implied that an english doctor killed my father and an english doctor crippled my arm – which is the fault of my mother who allowed no german physicians to attend to herself or her immediate family as a young man wilhelm fell in love with one of his maternal first cousins princess elisabeth of hessedarmstadt she however turned him down and would in time marry into the russian imperial family in  however wilhelm became engaged to augusta victoria of schleswigholstein known as dona the couple married on  february  and would remain married for forty years until her death in  in a period of ten years between  and  augusta victoria would bear wilhelm seven children six sons and a daughter beginning in  bismarck began advocating that kaiser wilhelm send his grandson on various diplomatic missions a privilege denied to the crown prince that year prince wilhelm was sent to the court of tsar alexander iii of russia in st petersburg to attend the coming of age ceremony of the sixteenyearold tsarevich nicholas however wilhelms behavior did little to ingratiate himself to the tsar two years later kaiser wilhelm i took prince wilhelm on a trip to meet with the austrohungarian emperor franz joseph in  also thanks to herbert von bismarck the son of the chancellor prince wilhelm began to be trained twice a week at the foreign ministry one privilege was denied to prince wilhelm to represent germany at his maternal

into conflict with the iron chancellor the dominant figure in the foundation of his empire the new emperor opposed bismarcks careful foreign policy preferring vigorous and rapid expansion to protect germanys place in the sun furthermore the young emperor had come to the throne determined to rule as well as reign unlike his grandfather while the letter of the imperial constitution vested executive power in the emperor wilhelm i had been content to leave daytoday administration to bismarck early conflicts between wilhelm ii and his chancellor soon poisoned the relationship between the two men bismarck believed that wilhelm was a lightweight who could be dominated and he showed scant respect for wilhelms policies in the late s the final split between monarch and statesman occurred soon

majority in favour of his policies in the reichstag decided to make the antisocialist laws permanent his kartell the majority of the amalgamated conservative party and the national liberal party favoured making the laws permanent with one exception the police power to expel socialist agitators from their homes the kartell split over this issue and nothing was passed as the debate continued wilhelm became more and more interested in social problems especially the treatment of mine workers who went on strike in  he routinely interrupted bismarck in council to make clear where he stood on social policy bismarck sharply disagreed with wilhelms policy and worked to circumvent it wilhelm ii german emperor bismarck feeling pressured and unappreciated by the young emperor and undermined by his ambitious advisors refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with wilhelm as was required by the german constitution the final break came as bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority with his kartell voted from power due to the antisocialist bill fiasco the remaining powers in the reichstag were the catholic centre party and the conservative party bismarck wished to form a new bloc with the centre party and invited ludwig windthorst the partys parliamentary leader to discuss a coalition wilhelm was furious to hear about windthorsts visit in a parliamentary state the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to ensure his policies a majority but in germany the chancellor had to depend on the confidence of the emperor and wilhelm believed that the emperor had the right to be informed before his ministers meeting after a heated argument at bismarcks estate over imperial authority wilhelm stormed out bismarck forced for the first time into a situation he could not use to his advantage wrote a blistering letter of resignation decrying wilhelms interference in foreign and domestic policy which was published only after bismarcks death although bismarck had sponsored landmark social security legislation by – he had become disillusioned with the attitude of workers in particular he was opposed to wage increases improving working conditions and regulating labour relations moreover the kartell the shifting political coalition that bismarck had been able to forge

hohenlohe in  wilhelm appointed the man whom he regarded as his own bismarck bernhard von bülow in foreign policy bismarck had achieved a fragile balance of interests between germany france and russia—peace was at hand and bismarck tried to keep it that way despite growing popular sentiment against britain regarding colonies and especially against russia with bismarcks dismissal the russians now expected a reversal of policy in berlin so they quickly came to terms with france beginning the process that by  largely isolated germany monarchical styles of german emperor wilhelm ii king of prussia reference style his imperial and royal majesty spoken style your imperial and royal majesty alternative style sire in appointing caprivi and then hohenlohe wilhelm was embarking upon what is known to history as the new course in which he hoped to exert decisive influence in the government of the empire there is debate amongst historians as to the precise degree to which wilhelm succeeded in implementing personal rule in this era but what is clear is the very different dynamic which existed between the crown and its chief political servant the chancellor in the wilhelmine era these chancellors were senior civil servants and not seasoned politicianstatesmen like bismarck wilhelm wanted to preclude the emergence of another iron chancellor whom he ultimately detested as being a boorish old killjoy who had not permitted any minister to see the emperor except in his presence keeping a stranglehold on effective political power upon his enforced retirement and until his dying day bismarck was to become a bitter critic of wilhelms policies but without the support of the supreme arbiter of all political appointments the emperor there was little chance of bismarck exerting a decisive influence on policy silver mark coin of wilhelm ii something which bismarck was able to effect was the creation of the bismarck myth this was a view—which some would argue was confirmed by subsequent events—that with the dismissal of the iron chancellor wilhelm ii effectively destroyed any chance germany had of stable and effective government in this view wilhelms new course was characterised far more as the german ship of state going out of control eventually leading through a series of crises to the carnage of the first and second world wars in the early twentieth century wilhelm began to concentrate upon his real agenda the creation of a german navy that would rival that of britain and enable germany to declare itself a world power he ordered his military leaders to read admiral alfred thayer mahans book the influence of sea power upon history and spent hours drawing sketches of the ships that he wanted built bülow and bethmann hollweg his loyal chancellors looked after domestic affairs while wilhelm began to spread alarm in the chancellories of europe with his increasingly eccentric views on foreign affairs promoter of arts and sciences wilhelm enthusiastically promoted the arts and sciences as well as public education and social welfare he sponsored the kaiser wilhelm society for the promotion of scientific research it was funded by wealthy private donors and by the state and comprised a number of research institutes in both pure and applied sciences the prussian academy of sciences was unable to avoid the kaisers pressure and lost some of its autonomy when it was forced to incorporate new programs in engineering and award new fellowships in engineering sciences as a result of a gift from the kaiser in  wilhelm supported the modernisers as they tried to reform the prussian system of secondary education which was rigidly traditional elitist politically authoritarian and unchanged by the progress in the natural sciences as hereditary protector of the order of saint john he offered encouragement to the christian orders attempts to place german medicine at the forefront of modern medical practice through its system of hospitals nursing sisterhood and nursing schools and nursing homes throughout the german empire wilhelm continued as protector of the order even after  as the position was in essence attached to the head of the house of hohenzollern personality emperor wilhelm ii talks with ethiopians at the tierpark hagenbeck in hamburg in  historians have frequently stressed the role of wilhelms personality in shaping his reign thus thomas nipperdey concludes he was gifted with a quick understanding sometimes brilliant with a taste for the modern—technology industry science—but at the same time superficial hasty restless unable to relax without any deeper level of seriousness without any desire for hard work or drive to see things through to the end without any sense of sobriety for balance and boundaries or even for reality and real problems uncontrollable and scarcely capable of learning from experience desperate for applause and success—as bismarck said early on in his life he wanted every day to be his birthday—romantic sentimental and theatrical unsure and arrogant with an immeasurably exaggerated selfconfidence and desire to show off a juvenile cadet who never took the tone of the officers mess out of his voice and brashly wanted to play the part of the supreme warlord full of panicky fear of a monotonous life without any diversions and yet aimless pathological in his hatred against his english mother historian david fromkin states that wilhelm had a lovehate relationship with britain according to fromkin from the outset the halfgerman side of him was at war with the halfenglish side he was wildly jealous of the british wanting to be british wanting to be better at being british than the british were while at the same time hating them and resenting them because he never could be fully accepted by them langer et al  emphasize the negative international consequences of wilhelms erratic personality he believed in force and the survival of the fittest in domestic as well as foreign politics william was not lacking in intelligence but he did lack stability disguising his deep insecurities by swagger and tough talk he frequently fell into depressions and hysterics williams personal instability was reflected in vacillations of policy his actions at home as well as abroad lacked guidance and therefore often bewildered or infuriated public opinion he was not so much concerned with gaining specific objectives as had been the case with bismarck as with asserting his will this trait in the ruler of the leading continental power was one of the main causes of the uneasiness prevailing in europe at the turnofthecentury relationships with foreign relatives as a grandchild of queen victoria wilhelm was a first cousin of the british empires king george v as well as of queens marie of romania maud of wales and victoria eugenie of spain and of the empress alexandra of russia in  wilhelms younger sister sophia married the future king constantine

king george i of the hellenes and king albert i of the belgians seated from left to right king alfonso xiii of spain king george v of the united kingdom and king frederick viii of denmark wilhelms most contentious relationships were with his british relations he craved the acceptance of his grandmother queen victoria and of the rest of her family despite the fact that his grandmother treated him with courtesy and tact his other relatives found him arrogant and obnoxious and they largely denied him acceptance he had an especially bad relationship with his uncle bertie the prince of wales later king edward vii between  and  wilhelm resented his uncle himself a mere heir to the english throne treating wilhelm not as emperor of germany but merely as another nephew in turn wilhelm often snubbed his uncle whom he referred to as the old peacock and lorded his position as emperor over him beginning in the s wilhelm made visits to england for cowes week on the isle of wight and often competed against his uncle in the yacht races edwards wife the danishborn alexandra first as princess of wales and later as queen also disliked wilhelm never forgetting the prussian seizure of schleswigholstein from denmark in the s as well as being annoyed over wilhelms treatment of his mother despite his poor relations with his english relatives nevertheless when he received news that queen victoria was dying at osborne house in january  wilhelm traveled to england and was at her bedside when she died and remained for the funeral he also was present at the funeral of king edward vii in  in  wilhelm hosted a lavish wedding in berlin for his only daughter victoria louise among the guests at the wedding were tsar nicholas ii of russia who also disliked wilhelm and his english cousin king george v and his wife queen mary antisemitism wilhelms biographer lamar cecil identified wilhelms curious but welldeveloped antisemitism noting that in  a friend of wilhelm declared that the young kaisers dislike of his hebrew subjects one rooted in a perception that they possessed an overweening influence in germany was so strong that it could not be overcome cecil concludes wilhelm never changed and throughout his life he believed that jews were perversely responsible largely through their prominence in the berlin press and in leftist political movements for encouraging opposition to his rule for individual jews ranging from rich businessmen and major art collectors to purveyors of elegant goods in berlin stores he had considerable esteem but he prevented jewish citizens from having careers in the army and the diplomatic corps and frequently used abusive language against them on  december  wilhelm wrote to field marshal august von mackensen denouncing his own abdication as the deepest most disgusting shame ever perpetrated by a person in history the germans have done to themselves egged on and misled by the tribe of judah  let no german ever forget this nor rest until these parasites have been destroyed and exterminated from german soil wilhelm advocated a regular international allworlds pogrom à la russe as the best cure and further believed that

john bull walking off with marianne turning his back on wilhelm ii whose saber is shown extending from his coat wilhelm ii with nicholas ii of russia in  wearing the military uniforms of each others nations german foreign policy under wilhelm ii was faced with a number of significant problems perhaps the most apparent was that wilhelm was an impatient man subjective in his reactions and affected strongly by sentiment and impulse he was personally illequipped to steer german foreign policy along a rational course it is now widely recognised that the various spectacular acts which wilhelm undertook in the international sphere were often partially encouraged by the german foreign policy elite there were a number of notorious examples such as the kruger telegram of  in which wilhelm congratulated president paul kruger of the transvaal republic on the suppression of the british jameson raid thus alienating british public opinion british public opinion had been quite favourable toward the kaiser in his first twelve years on the throne but it turned sour in the late s during the first world war he became the central target of british antigerman propaganda and the personification of a hated enemy wilhelm invented and spread fears of a yellow peril trying to interest other european rulers in the perils they faced by invading china few other leaders paid attention wilhelm used the japanese victory in the russojapanese war to try and incite fear in the west of the yellow peril they faced by a resurgent japan which wilhelm claimed would ally with china to overrun the west under wilhelm germany invested in strengthening its colonies in africa and the pacific but few became profitable and all were lost during the first world war in south west africa now namibia a native revolt against german rule led to the herero and namaqua genocide although wilhelm eventually ordered it to be stopped one of the few times when wilhelm succeeded in personal

daily telegraph affair of  involved the publication in germany of an interview with a british daily newspaper that included wild statements and diplomatically damaging remarks wilhelm had seen the interview as an opportunity to promote his views and ideas on anglogerman friendship but due to his emotional outbursts during the course of the interview he ended up further alienating not only the british but also the french russians and japanese he implied among other things that the germans cared nothing for the british that the french and russians had attempted to incite germany to intervene in the second boer war and that the german naval buildup was targeted against the japanese not britain one memorable quotation from the interview was you english are mad mad mad as march hares the effect in germany was quite significant with serious calls for his abdication wilhelm kept a very low profile for many months after the daily telegraph fiasco but later exacted his revenge by forcing the resignation of the chancellor prince bülow who had abandoned the emperor to public scorn by not having the transcript edited before its german publication the daily telegraph crisis deeply wounded

some day wilhelms frustration over his fleets poor showing at the fleet review at his grandmother queen victorias diamond jubilee celebrations combined with his inability to exert german influence in south africa following the dispatch of the kruger telegram led to wilhelm taking definitive steps toward the construction of a fleet to rival that of his british cousins wilhelm was fortunate to be able to call on the services of the dynamic naval officer alfred von tirpitz whom he appointed to the head of the imperial naval office in  the new admiral had conceived of what came to be known as

ultimate authority in matters of political appointment and it was only after his consent had been gained that major changes to the high command could be effected wilhelm was in favour of the dismissal of helmuth von moltke the younger in september  and his replacement by erich von falkenhayn in  hindenburg and ludendorff decided that bethmanhollweg was no longer acceptable to them as chancellor and

this article statement of abdication wilhelm was at the imperial army headquarters in spa belgium when the uprisings in berlin and other centres took him by surprise in late  mutiny among the ranks of his beloved kaiserliche marine the imperial navy profoundly shocked him after the outbreak of the german revolution wilhelm could not make up his mind whether or not to abdicate up to that point he accepted that he would likely have to give up the imperial crown but still hoped to retain the prussian kingship however this was impossible under the imperial constitution while wilhelm thought he ruled as emperor in a personal union with prussia the constitution actually tied the imperial crown to the prussian crown meaning that wilhelm could not renounce one crown without renouncing the other wilhelms hopes of retaining at least one of his crowns was revealed as unrealistic when in the hope of preserving the monarchy in the face of growing revolutionary unrest chancellor prince max of baden announced wilhelms abdication of both titles on  november  prince max himself was forced to resign later the same day when it became clear that only friedrich ebert leader of the spd could effectively exert control later that day one of eberts secretaries of state ministers social democrat philipp scheidemann proclaimed germany a republic wilhelm consented to the abdication only after ludendorffs replacement general wilhelm groener had informed him that the officers and men of the army would march back in good order under paul von hindenburgs command but would certainly not fight for wilhelms throne on the home front the monarchys last and strongest support had been broken and finally even hindenburg himself a lifelong royalist was obliged with some embarrassment to advise the emperor to give up the crown the fact that the high command might one day abandon the kaiser had been foreseen in december  when wilhelm had visited otto von bismarck for the last time bismarck had again warned the kaiser about the increasing influence of militarists especially of the admirals who were pushing for the construction of a battle fleet bismarcks last warning had been your majesty so long as you have this present officer corps you can do as you please but when this is no longer the case it will be very different for you subsequently bismarck had predicted accurately jena came twenty years after the death of frederick the great the crash will come twenty years after my departure if things go on like this on  november wilhelm crossed the border by train and went into exile in the netherlands which had remained neutral throughout the war upon the conclusion of the treaty of versailles in early  article  expressly provided for the prosecution of wilhelm for a supreme offence against international morality and the sanctity of treaties but the dutch government refused to extradite him despite appeals from the allies king george v wrote that he looked on his cousin as the greatest criminal in history but opposed prime minister david lloyd georges proposal to hang the kaiser president woodrow wilson of the united states rejected extradition arguing that prosecuting wilhelm would destabilize international order and lose the peace wilhelm first settled in amerongen where on  november he issued a belated statement of abdication from both the prussian and imperial thrones thus formally ending the hohenzollerns year rule over prussia accepting the reality that he had lost both of his crowns for good he gave up his rights to the throne of prussia and to the german imperial throne connected therewith he also released his soldiers and officials in both prussia and the empire from their oath of loyalty to him he purchased a country house in the municipality of doorn known as huis doorn and moved in on  may  this was to be his home for the remainder of his life the weimar republic allowed wilhelm to remove twentythree railway wagons of furniture twentyseven containing packages of all sorts one bearing a car and another a boat from the new palace at potsdam life in exile in  wilhelm published the first volume of his memoirs—a very slim volume that insisted he was not guilty of initiating the great war and defended his conduct throughout his reign especially in matters of foreign policy for the remaining twenty years of his life he entertained guests often of some standing and kept himself updated on events in europe he grew a beard and allowed his famous moustache to droop he also learned the dutch language wilhelm developed a penchant for archaeology while residing at the corfu achilleion excavating at the site of the temple of artemis in corfu a passion he retained in his exile he had bought the former greek residence of empress elisabeth after her murder in  he also sketched plans for grand buildings and battleships when he was bored in exile one of wilhelms greatest passions was hunting and he bagged thousands of animals both beast and bird much of his time was spent chopping wood and thousands of trees were chopped down during his stay at doorn in the early s wilhelm apparently hoped that the successes of the german nazi party would stimulate interest in a restoration of the monarchy with his eldest grandson as the fourth kaiser his second wife hermine actively petitioned the nazi government on her husbands behalf however adolf hitler himself a veteran of the first world war like other leading nazis felt nothing but scorn for the man they blamed for germanys greatest defeat and the petitions were ignored though he played host to hermann göring at doorn on at least one occasion wilhelm grew to distrust hitler hearing of the murder of the wife of former chancellor schleicher he said we have ceased to live under the rule of law and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall wilhelm was also appalled at the kristallnacht of – november  saying i have just made my views clear to auwi wilhelms fourth son in the presence of his brothers he had the nerve to say that he agreed with the jewish pogroms and understood why they had come about when i told him that any decent man would describe these actions as gangsterisms he appeared totally indifferent he is completely lost to our family he also stated for the first time i am ashamed to be a german theres a man alone without family without children without god he builds legions but he doesnt build a nation a nation is created by families a religion traditions it is made up out of the hearts of mothers the wisdom of fathers the joy and the exuberance of children for a few months i was inclined to believe in national socialism i thought of it as a necessary fever and i was gratified to see that there were associated with it for a time some of the wisest and most outstanding germans but these one by one he has got rid of or even killed he has left nothing but a bunch of shirted gangsters this man could bring home victories to our people each year without bringing them either glory or danger but of our germany which was a nation of poets and musicians of artists and soldiers he has made a nation of hysterics and hermits engulfed in a mob and led by a thousand liars or fanatics ― wilhelm on hitler december  in the wake of the german victory over poland in september  wilhelms adjutant general von dommes wrote on his behalf to hitler stating that the house of hohenzollern remained loyal and noted that nine prussian princes one son and eight grandchildren were stationed at the front concluding because of the special circumstances that require residence in a neutral foreign country his majesty must personally decline to make the aforementioned comment the emperor has therefore charged me with making a communication wilhelm greatly admired the success which hitler was able to achieve in the opening months of the second world war and personally sent a congratulatory telegram when the netherlands surrendered in may  my fuhrer i congratulate you and hope that under your marvellous leadership the german monarchy will be restored completely hitler was reportedly exasperated and bemused and remarked to linge his valet what an idiot in another telegram to hitler upon the fall of paris a month later wilhelm stated congratulations you have won using my troops in a letter to his daughter victoria louise duchess of brunswick he wrote triumphantly thus is the pernicious entente cordiale of uncle edward vii brought to nought nevertheless after the nazi conquest of the netherlands in  the aging wilhelm retired completely from public life in may  when hitler invaded the netherlands wilhelm declined an offer from churchill of asylum in britain preferring to die at huis doorn during his last year at doorn wilhelm believed that germany was the land of monarchy and therefore of christ and that england was the land of liberalism and therefore of satan and the antichrist he argued that the english ruling classes were freemasons thoroughly infected by juda wilhelm asserted that the british people must be liberated from antichrist juda we must drive juda out of england just as he has been chased out of the continentclarification needed he believed the freemasons and jews had caused the two world wars aiming at a world jewish empire with british and american gold but that judas plan has been smashed to pieces and they themselves swept out of the european continent continental europe was now wilhelm wrote consolidating and closing itself off from british influences after the elimination of the british and the jews the end result would be a us of europeclarification needed in a letter of  to his sister princess margaret wilhelm wrote the hand of god is creating a new world  working miracles we are becoming the us of europe under german leadership a united european continent he added the jews are being thrust out of their nefarious positions in all countries whom they have driven to hostility for centuries also in  came what would have been his mothers th birthday on which he wrote ironically to a friend today the th birthday of my mother no notice is taken of it at home no memorial service or committee to remember her marvellous work for the welfare of our german people nobody of the new generation knows anything about her this sympathy for his mother is in sharp contrast to the intense animosity he expressed for her during most of her lifecitation needed the huis doorn in  wilhelm in  huis doorn in the netherlands death wilhelm iis tomb in doorn netherlands wilhelm died of a pulmonary embolus in doorn netherlands on  june  aged  just weeks before the axis invasion of the soviet union german soldiers had been guarding his house hitler however was reportedby whom to be angry that the former monarch had an honor guard of german troops and nearly fired the general who ordered them when he found out despite his personal animosity toward wilhelm hitler wanted to bring his body back to berlin for a state funeral as wilhelm was a symbol of germany and germans during the previous world war hitler felt that such a funeral would demonstrate to the germans the direct descent of the third reich from the old german empire however wilhelms wishes never to return to germany until the restoration of the monarchy were respected and the nazi occupation authorities granted him a small military funeral with a few hundred people present the mourners included august von mackensen fully dressed in his old imperial life hussars uniform admiral wilhelm canaris and reichskommissar for the netherlands arthur seyssinquart along with a few other military advisers however wilhelms request that the swastika and other nazi regalia be not displayed at his funeral was ignored and they are featured in the photographs of the event taken by a dutch photographer wilhelm was buried in a mausoleum in the grounds of huis doorn which has since become a place of pilgrimage for german monarchists small but enthusiastic and faithful numbers of them gather there every year on the anniversary of his death to pay their homage to the last german emperor historiography three trends have characterized the writing about wilhelm first the courtinspired writers considered him a martyr and a hero often uncritically accepting the justifications provided in the kaisers own memoirs second there came those who judged wilhelm to be completely unable to handle the great responsibilities of his position a ruler too reckless to deal with power third after  later scholars have sought to transcend the passions of the early th century and attempted an objective portrayal of wilhelm and his rule on  june  a year before the great war began the new york times published a special supplement devoted to the th anniversary of the kaisers coronation the banner headline read kaiser  years a ruler hailed as chief peacemaker the accompanying story called him the greatest factor for peace that our time can show and credited wilhelm with frequently rescuing europe from the brink of war until the late s the kaiser was depicted by most historians as a man of considerable influence partly that was a deception by german officials for example president theodore roosevelt believed the kaiser was in control of german foreign policy because hermann speck von sternburg the german ambassador in washington and a personal friend of roosevelt presented to the president messages from chancellor von bülow as messages from the kaiser later historians downplayed his role arguing that senior officials learned to work around him more recently historian john c g röhl has portrayed wilhelm as the key figure in understanding the recklessness and downfall of imperial germany thus the argument is made that the kaiser played a major role in promoting the policies of naval and colonial expansion that caused the sharp deterioration in germanys relations with britain before  first marriage and issue wilhelm and his first wife augusta viktoria wilhelm and his first wife

to prussia and also after  to the newly created german empire which according to the constitution of the german empire was ruled by the prussian king wilhelm with his father in highland dress in  a traumatic breech birth left him with a withered left arm due to erbs palsy which he tried with some success to conceal in many photos he carries a pair of white gloves in his left hand to make the arm seem longer holds his left hand with his right or has his crippled arm on the hilt of a sword or holding a cane to give the effect of a useful limb posed at a dignified angle his left arm was about  inches  centimetres shorter than his right arm historians have suggested that this disability affected his emotional developmentdubious – discuss early years in  wilhelm was taken to england to be present at the wedding of his uncle bertie later king edward vii and princess alexandra of denmark william attended the ceremony in a highland costume complete with a small toy dirk during the ceremony the fouryearold became restless his eighteenyearold uncle alfred duke of saxecoburg and gotha charged with keeping an eye on him told him to be quiet but wilhelm drew his dirk and threatened alfred when alfred attempted to subdue him by force wilhelm bit him on the leg his grandmother queen victoria missed seeing the fracas to her wilhelm remained a clever dear good little child the great favourite of my beloved vicky his mother vicky was obsessed with his damaged arm she blamed herself for the childs handicap and insisted that he become a good rider the thought that he as heir to the throne should not be able to ride was intolerable to her riding lessons began when wilhelm was eight and were a matter of endurance for wilhelm over and over the weeping prince was set on his horse and compelled to go through the paces he fell off time after time but despite his tears was set on its back again after weeks of this he finally got it right and was able to maintain his balance wilhelm from six years of age was tutored and heavily influenced by the yearold teacher georg hinzpeter hinzpeter he later wrote was really a good fellow whether he was the right tutor for me i dare not decide the torments inflicted on me in this pony riding must be attributed to my mother as a teenager he was educated at kassel at the friedrichsgymnasium in january  wilhelm finished high school and on his eighteenth birthday received as a present from his grandmother queen victoria the order of the garter after kassel he spent four terms at the university of bonn studying law and politics he became a member of the exclusive corps borussia bonn wilhelm possessed a quick intelligence but this was often overshadowed by a cantankerous temper prussian royalty house of hohenzollern wilhelm ii

hohenzollern wilhelm was exposed from an early age to the military society of the prussian aristocracy this had a major impact on him and in maturity wilhelm was seldom seen out of uniform the hypermasculine military culture of prussia in this period did much to frame his political ideals and personal relationships crown prince frederick was viewed by his son with a deeply felt love and respect his fathers status as a hero of the wars of unification was largely responsible for the young wilhelms attitude as were the circumstances in which he was raised close emotional contact between father and son was not encouraged later as he came into contact with the crown princes political opponents wilhelm came to adopt more ambivalent feelings toward his father perceiving the influence of wilhelms mother over a figure who should have been possessed of masculine independence and strength wilhelm also idolised his grandfather wilhelm i and he was instrumental in later attempts to foster a cult of the first german emperor as wilhelm the great however he had a distant relationship with his mother wilhelm resisted attempts by his parents especially his mother to educate him in british attitudes towards democracy instead he agreed with his german tutors support of autocratic rule and gradually became thoroughly prussianized under their influence he thus became alienated from his parents suspecting them of putting britains interests first the german emperor wilhelm i watched as his grandson guided principally by the crown princess victoria grew to manhood when wilhelm was nearing twentyone the emperor decided it was time his grandson should begin the military phase of his preparation for the throne he was assigned as a lieutenant to the first regiment of foot guards stationed at potsdam in the guards wilhelm said i really found my family my friends my interests — everything of which i had up to that time had to do without as a boy and a student his manner had been polite and agreeable as an officer he began to strut and speak brusquely in the tone he deemed appropriate for a prussian officer in many ways wilhelm was a victim of his inheritance and of otto von bismarcks machinations both sides of his family had suffered from mental illness and this may explain his emotional instabilitycitation needed when wilhelm was in his early twenties bismarck tried to separate him from his parents who opposed bismarck and his policies with some success bismarck planned to use the young prince as a weapon against his parents in order to retain his own political dominance wilhelm thus developed a dysfunctional relationship with his parents but especially with his english mother in an outburst in april  wilhelm angrily implied that an english doctor killed my father and an english doctor crippled my arm – which is the fault of my mother who allowed no german physicians to attend to herself or her immediate family as a young man wilhelm fell in love with one of his maternal first cousins princess elisabeth of hessedarmstadt she however turned him down and would in time marry into the russian imperial family in  however wilhelm became engaged to augusta victoria of schleswigholstein known as dona the couple married on  february  and would remain married for forty years until her death in  in a period of ten years between  and  augusta victoria would bear wilhelm seven children six sons and a daughter beginning in  bismarck began advocating that kaiser wilhelm send his grandson on various diplomatic missions a privilege denied to the crown prince that year prince wilhelm was sent to the court of tsar alexander iii of russia in st petersburg to attend the coming of age ceremony of the sixteenyearold tsarevich nicholas however wilhelms behavior did little to ingratiate himself to the tsar two years later kaiser wilhelm i took prince wilhelm on a trip to meet with the austrohungarian emperor franz joseph in  also thanks to herbert von bismarck the son of the chancellor prince wilhelm began to be trained twice a week at the foreign ministry one privilege was denied to prince wilhelm to represent germany at his maternal

favoured making the laws permanent with one exception the police power to expel socialist agitators from their homes the kartell split over this issue and nothing was passed as the debate continued wilhelm became more and more interested in social problems especially the treatment of mine workers who went on strike in  he routinely interrupted bismarck in council to make clear where he stood on social policy bismarck sharply disagreed with wilhelms policy and worked to circumvent it wilhelm ii german emperor bismarck feeling pressured and unappreciated by the young emperor and undermined by his ambitious advisors refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with wilhelm as was required by the german constitution the final break came as bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority with his kartell voted from power due to the antisocialist bill fiasco the remaining powers in the reichstag were the catholic centre party and the conservative party bismarck wished to form a new bloc with the centre party and invited ludwig windthorst the partys parliamentary leader to discuss a coalition wilhelm was furious to hear about windthorsts visit in a parliamentary state the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to ensure his policies a majority but in germany the chancellor had to depend on the confidence of the emperor and wilhelm believed that the emperor had the right to be informed before his ministers meeting after a heated argument at bismarcks estate over imperial authority wilhelm stormed out bismarck forced for the first time into a situation he could not use to his advantage wrote a blistering letter of resignation decrying wilhelms interference in foreign and domestic policy which was published only after bismarcks death although bismarck had sponsored landmark social security legislation by – he had become disillusioned with the attitude of workers in

hohenlohe in  wilhelm appointed the man whom he regarded as his own bismarck bernhard von bülow in foreign policy bismarck had achieved a fragile balance of interests between germany france and russia—peace was at hand and bismarck tried to keep it that way despite growing popular sentiment against britain regarding colonies and especially against russia with bismarcks dismissal the russians now expected a reversal of policy in berlin so they quickly came to terms with france beginning the process that by  largely isolated germany monarchical styles of german emperor wilhelm ii king of prussia reference style his imperial and royal majesty spoken style your imperial and royal majesty alternative style sire in appointing caprivi and then hohenlohe wilhelm was embarking upon what is known to history as the new course in which he hoped to exert decisive influence in the government of the empire there is debate amongst historians as to the precise degree to which wilhelm succeeded in implementing personal rule in this era but what is clear is the very different dynamic which existed between the crown and its chief political servant the chancellor in the wilhelmine era these chancellors were senior civil servants and not seasoned politicianstatesmen like bismarck wilhelm wanted to preclude the emergence of another iron chancellor whom he ultimately detested as being a boorish old killjoy who had not permitted any minister to see the emperor except in his presence keeping a stranglehold on effective political power upon his enforced retirement and until his dying day bismarck was to become a bitter critic of wilhelms policies but without the support of the supreme arbiter of all political appointments the emperor there was little chance of bismarck exerting a decisive influence on policy silver mark coin of wilhelm ii something which bismarck was able to effect was the creation of the bismarck myth this was a view—which some would argue was confirmed by subsequent events—that with the dismissal of the iron chancellor wilhelm ii effectively destroyed any chance germany had of stable and effective government in this view wilhelms new course was characterised far more as the german ship of state going out of control eventually leading through a series of crises to the carnage of the first and second world wars in the early twentieth century wilhelm began to concentrate upon his real agenda the creation of a german navy that would rival that of britain and enable germany to declare itself a world power he ordered his military leaders to read admiral alfred thayer mahans book the influence of sea power upon history and spent hours drawing sketches of the ships that he wanted built bülow and bethmann hollweg his loyal chancellors looked after domestic affairs while wilhelm began to spread alarm in the chancellories of europe with his increasingly eccentric views on foreign affairs promoter of arts and sciences wilhelm enthusiastically promoted the arts and sciences as well as public education and social welfare he sponsored the kaiser wilhelm society for the promotion of scientific research it was funded by wealthy private donors and by the state and comprised a number of research institutes in both pure and applied sciences the prussian academy of sciences was unable to avoid the kaisers pressure and lost some of its autonomy when it was forced to incorporate new programs in engineering and award new fellowships in engineering sciences as a result of a gift from the kaiser in  wilhelm supported the modernisers as they tried to reform the prussian system of secondary education which was rigidly traditional elitist politically authoritarian and unchanged by the progress in the natural sciences as hereditary protector of the order of saint john he offered encouragement to the christian orders attempts to place german medicine at the forefront of modern medical practice through its system of hospitals nursing sisterhood and nursing schools and nursing homes throughout the german empire wilhelm continued as protector of the order even after  as the position was in essence attached to the head of the house of hohenzollern personality emperor wilhelm ii talks with ethiopians at the tierpark hagenbeck in hamburg in  historians have frequently stressed the role of wilhelms personality in shaping his reign thus thomas nipperdey concludes he was gifted with a quick understanding sometimes brilliant with a taste for the modern—technology industry science—but at the same time superficial hasty restless unable to relax without any deeper level of seriousness without any desire for hard work or drive to see things through to the end without any sense of sobriety for balance and boundaries or even for reality and real problems uncontrollable and scarcely capable of learning from experience desperate for applause and success—as bismarck said early on in his life he wanted every day to be his birthday—romantic sentimental and theatrical unsure and arrogant with an immeasurably exaggerated selfconfidence and desire to show off a juvenile cadet who never took the tone of the officers mess out of his voice and brashly wanted to play the part of the supreme warlord full of panicky fear of a monotonous life without any diversions and yet aimless pathological in his hatred against his english mother historian david fromkin states that wilhelm had a lovehate relationship with britain according to fromkin from the outset the halfgerman side of him was at war with the halfenglish side he was wildly jealous of the british wanting to be british wanting to be better at being british than the british were while at the same time hating them and resenting them because he never could be fully accepted by them langer et al  emphasize the negative international consequences of wilhelms erratic personality he believed in force and the survival of the fittest in domestic as well as foreign politics william was not lacking in intelligence but he did lack stability disguising his deep insecurities by swagger and tough talk he frequently fell into depressions and hysterics williams personal instability was reflected in vacillations of policy his actions at home as well as abroad lacked guidance and therefore often bewildered or infuriated public opinion he was not so much concerned with gaining specific objectives as had been the case with bismarck as with asserting his will this trait in the ruler of the leading continental power was one of the main causes of the uneasiness prevailing in europe at the turnofthecentury relationships with foreign relatives as a grandchild of queen victoria wilhelm was a first cousin of the british empires king george v as well as of queens marie of romania maud of wales and victoria eugenie of spain and of the empress alexandra of russia in  wilhelms younger sister sophia married the future king constantine i of greece wilhelm infuriated by his sisters conversion to greek orthodoxy upon her marriage attempted to ban her from entering germany the nine sovereigns at windsor for the funeral of king edward

king george i of the hellenes and king albert i of the belgians seated from left to right king alfonso xiii of spain king george v of the united kingdom and king frederick viii of denmark wilhelms most contentious relationships were with his british relations he craved the acceptance of his grandmother queen victoria and of the rest of her family despite the fact that his grandmother treated him with courtesy and tact his other relatives found him arrogant and obnoxious and they largely denied him acceptance he had an especially bad relationship with his uncle bertie the prince of wales later king edward vii between  and  wilhelm resented his uncle himself a mere heir to the english throne treating wilhelm not as emperor of germany but merely as another nephew in turn wilhelm often snubbed his uncle whom he referred to as the old peacock and lorded his position as emperor over him beginning in the s wilhelm made visits to england for cowes week on the isle of wight and often competed against his uncle in the yacht races edwards wife the danishborn alexandra first as princess of wales and later as queen also disliked wilhelm never forgetting the prussian seizure of schleswigholstein from denmark in the s as well as being annoyed over wilhelms treatment of his mother despite his poor relations with his english relatives nevertheless when he received news that queen victoria was dying at osborne house in january  wilhelm traveled to england and was at her bedside when she died and remained for the funeral he also was present at the funeral of king edward vii in  in  wilhelm hosted a lavish wedding in berlin for his only daughter victoria louise among the guests at the wedding were tsar nicholas ii of russia who also disliked wilhelm and his english cousin king george v and his wife queen mary antisemitism wilhelms biographer lamar cecil identified wilhelms curious but welldeveloped antisemitism noting that in  a friend of wilhelm declared that the young kaisers dislike of his hebrew subjects one rooted in a perception that they possessed an overweening influence in germany was so strong that it could not be overcome cecil concludes wilhelm never changed and throughout his life he believed that jews were perversely responsible largely through their prominence in the berlin press and in leftist political movements for encouraging opposition to his rule for individual jews ranging from rich businessmen and major art collectors to purveyors of elegant goods in berlin stores he had considerable esteem but he prevented jewish citizens from having careers in the army and the diplomatic corps and frequently used abusive language against them on  december  wilhelm wrote to field marshal august von mackensen denouncing his own abdication as the deepest most disgusting shame ever perpetrated by a person in history the germans have done to themselves egged on and misled by the tribe of judah  let no german ever forget this nor rest until these parasites have been destroyed and exterminated from german soil wilhelm advocated a regular international allworlds pogrom à la russe as the best cure and further believed that

john bull walking off with marianne turning his back on wilhelm ii whose saber is shown extending from his coat wilhelm ii with nicholas ii of russia in  wearing the military uniforms of each others nations german foreign policy under wilhelm ii was faced with a number of significant problems perhaps the most apparent was that wilhelm was an impatient man subjective in his reactions and affected strongly by sentiment and impulse he was personally illequipped to steer german foreign policy along a rational course it is now widely recognised that the various spectacular acts which wilhelm undertook in the international sphere were often partially encouraged by the german foreign policy elite there were a number of notorious examples such as the kruger telegram of  in which wilhelm congratulated president paul kruger of the transvaal republic on the suppression of the british jameson raid thus alienating british public opinion british public opinion had been quite favourable toward the kaiser in his first twelve years on the throne but it turned sour in the late s during the first world war he became the central target of british antigerman propaganda and the personification of a hated enemy wilhelm invented and spread fears of a yellow peril trying to interest other european rulers in the perils they faced by invading china few other leaders paid attention wilhelm used the japanese victory in the russojapanese war to try and incite fear in the west of the yellow peril they faced by a resurgent japan which wilhelm claimed would ally with china to overrun the west under wilhelm germany invested in strengthening its colonies in africa and the pacific but few became profitable and all were lost during the first world war in south west africa now namibia a native revolt against german rule led to the herero and namaqua genocide although wilhelm eventually ordered it to be stopped one of the few times when wilhelm succeeded in personal

german imperial power there were two versions of the speech the foreign office issued an edited version making sure to omit one particularly incendiary paragraph that they regarded as diplomatically embarrassing the edited version read like this great overseas tasks have fallen to the new german empire tasks far greater than many of my countrymen expected the german empire has by its very

daily telegraph affair of  involved the publication in germany of an interview with a british daily newspaper that included wild statements and diplomatically damaging remarks wilhelm had seen the interview as an opportunity to promote his views and ideas on anglogerman friendship but due to his emotional outbursts during the course of the interview he ended up further alienating not only the british but also the french russians and japanese he implied among other things that the germans cared nothing for the british that the french and russians had attempted to incite germany to intervene in the second boer war and that the german naval buildup was targeted against the japanese not britain one memorable quotation from the interview was you english are mad mad mad as march hares the effect in germany was quite significant with serious calls for his abdication wilhelm kept a very low profile for many months after the daily telegraph fiasco but later exacted his revenge by forcing the resignation of the chancellor prince bülow who had abandoned the emperor to public scorn by not having the transcript edited before its german publication the daily telegraph crisis deeply wounded wilhelms previously unimpaired selfconfidence and he soon suffered a severe bout of depression from which he never fully recovered he lost much of the influence he had previously exercised in domestic

some day wilhelms frustration over his fleets poor showing at the fleet review at his grandmother queen victorias diamond jubilee celebrations combined with his inability to exert german influence in

me a different answer wilhelm is also reported to have said to think that george and nicky should have played me false if my grandmother had been alive she would never have allowed it in the original schlieffen plan germany would attack the supposed weaker enemy first meaning france the plan supposed that it would take a long time before russia was ready for war defeating france had been easy for prussia in the francoprussian war in  at the  border between france and germany an attack at this more southern part of france could be stopped by the french fortress along the border however wilhelm ii stopped any invasion of the netherlands italian poster from  showing wilhelm ii biting into the world the text reads the glutton – too hard shadowkaiser hindenburg wilhelm ii and ludendorff in january  wilhelms role in wartime was of everdecreasing power as he increasingly handled awards ceremonies and honorific duties the high command continued with its strategy even when it was clear that the schlieffen plan had failed by  the empire had effectively become a military dictatorship under the control of field marshal paul von hindenburg and general erich ludendorff increasingly cut off from reality and the political decisionmaking process wilhelm vacillated between defeatism and dreams of victory depending upon the fortunes of his armies nevertheless wilhelm still retained the ultimate authority in matters of political appointment and it was only after his consent had been gained that major changes to the high command could be effected wilhelm was in favour of the dismissal of helmuth von moltke the younger in september  and his replacement by erich von falkenhayn in  hindenburg and ludendorff decided that bethmanhollweg was no longer acceptable to them as chancellor and called upon the kaiser to appoint somebody else when asked whom they would accept ludendorff recommended georg michaelis a nonentity he barely knew the kaiser did not know michaelis but accepted the suggestion upon hearing in july  that his cousin george v had changed the name of the british royal house to windsor wilhelm remarked that he planned to see shakespeares play the merry wives of saxecoburggotha the kaisers support collapsed completely in october–november  in the army in the civilian government and in german public opinion as president woodrow wilson made clear the kaiser could no longer be a party to peace negotiations that year also saw wilhelm sickened during the worldwide  flu pandemic though he survived abdication and flight wikisource has original text related to this article statement of abdication wilhelm was at the imperial army headquarters in spa belgium when the uprisings in berlin and other centres took him by surprise in late  mutiny among the ranks of his beloved kaiserliche marine the imperial navy profoundly shocked him after the outbreak of the german revolution wilhelm could not make up his mind whether or not to abdicate up to that point he accepted that he would likely have to give up the imperial crown but still hoped to retain the prussian kingship however this was impossible under the imperial constitution while wilhelm thought he ruled as emperor in a personal union with prussia the constitution actually tied the imperial crown to the prussian crown meaning that wilhelm could not renounce one crown without renouncing the other wilhelms hopes of retaining at least one of his crowns was revealed as unrealistic when in the hope of preserving the monarchy in the face of growing revolutionary unrest chancellor prince max of baden announced wilhelms abdication of both titles on  november  prince max himself was forced to resign later the same day when it became clear that only friedrich ebert leader of the spd could effectively exert control later that day one of eberts secretaries of state ministers social democrat philipp scheidemann proclaimed germany a republic wilhelm consented to the abdication only after ludendorffs replacement general wilhelm groener had informed him that the officers and men of the army would march back in good order under paul von hindenburgs command but would certainly not fight for wilhelms throne on the home front the monarchys last and strongest support had been broken and finally even hindenburg himself a lifelong royalist was obliged with some embarrassment to advise the emperor to give up the crown the fact that the high command might one day abandon the kaiser had been foreseen in december  when wilhelm had visited otto von bismarck for the last time bismarck had again warned the kaiser about the increasing influence of militarists especially of the admirals who were pushing for the construction of a battle fleet bismarcks last warning had been your majesty so long as you have this present officer corps you can do as you please but when this is no longer the case it will be very different for you subsequently bismarck had predicted accurately jena came twenty years after the death of frederick the great the crash will come twenty years after my departure if things go on like this on  november wilhelm crossed the border by train and went into exile in the netherlands which had remained neutral throughout the war upon the conclusion of the treaty of versailles in early  article  expressly provided for the prosecution of wilhelm for a supreme offence against international morality and the sanctity of treaties but the dutch government refused to extradite him despite appeals from the allies king george v wrote that he looked on his cousin as the greatest criminal in history but opposed prime minister david lloyd georges proposal to hang the kaiser president woodrow wilson of the united states rejected extradition arguing that prosecuting wilhelm would destabilize international order and lose the peace wilhelm first settled in amerongen where on  november he issued a belated statement of abdication from both the prussian and imperial thrones thus formally ending the hohenzollerns year rule over prussia accepting the reality that he had lost both of his crowns for good he gave up his rights to the throne of prussia and to the german imperial throne connected therewith he also released his soldiers and officials in both prussia and the empire from their oath of loyalty to him he purchased a country house in the municipality of doorn known as huis doorn and moved in on  may  this was to be his home for the remainder of his life the weimar republic allowed wilhelm to remove twentythree railway wagons of furniture twentyseven containing packages of all sorts one bearing a car and another a boat from the new palace at potsdam life in exile in  wilhelm published the first volume of his memoirs—a very slim volume that insisted he was not guilty of initiating the great war and defended his conduct throughout his reign especially in matters of foreign policy for the remaining twenty years of his life he entertained guests often of some standing and kept himself updated on events in europe he grew a beard and allowed his famous moustache to droop he also learned the dutch language wilhelm developed a penchant for archaeology while residing at the corfu achilleion excavating at the site of the temple of artemis in corfu a passion he retained in his exile he had bought the former greek residence of empress elisabeth after her murder in  he also sketched plans for grand buildings and battleships when he was bored in exile one of wilhelms greatest passions was hunting and he bagged thousands of animals both beast and bird much of his time was spent chopping wood and thousands of trees were chopped down during his stay at doorn in the early s wilhelm apparently hoped that the successes of the german nazi party would stimulate interest in a restoration of the monarchy with his eldest grandson as the fourth kaiser his second wife hermine actively petitioned the nazi government on her husbands behalf however adolf hitler himself a veteran of the first world war like other leading nazis felt nothing but scorn for the man they blamed for germanys greatest defeat and the petitions were ignored though he played host to hermann göring at doorn on at least one occasion wilhelm grew to distrust hitler hearing of the murder of the wife of former chancellor schleicher he said we have ceased to live under the rule of law and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall wilhelm was also appalled at the kristallnacht of – november  saying i have just made my views clear to auwi wilhelms fourth son in the presence of his brothers he had the nerve to say that he agreed with the jewish pogroms and understood why they had come about when i told him that any decent man would describe these actions as gangsterisms he appeared totally indifferent he is completely lost to our family he also stated for the first time i am ashamed to be a german theres a man alone without family without children without god he builds legions but he doesnt build a nation a nation is created by families a religion traditions it is made up out of the hearts of mothers the wisdom of fathers the joy and the exuberance of children for a few months i was inclined to believe in national socialism i thought of it as a necessary fever and i was gratified to see that there were associated with it for a time some of the wisest and most outstanding germans but these one by one he has got rid of or even killed he has left nothing but a bunch of shirted gangsters this man could bring home victories to our people each year without bringing them either glory or danger but of our germany which was a nation of poets and musicians of artists and soldiers he has made a nation of hysterics and hermits engulfed in a mob and led by a thousand liars or fanatics ― wilhelm on hitler december  in the wake of the german victory over poland in september  wilhelms adjutant general von dommes wrote on his behalf to hitler stating that the house of hohenzollern remained loyal and noted that nine prussian princes one son and eight grandchildren were stationed at the front concluding because of the special circumstances that require residence in a neutral foreign country his majesty must personally decline to make the aforementioned comment the emperor has therefore charged me with making a communication wilhelm greatly admired the success which hitler was able to achieve in the opening months of the second world war and personally sent a congratulatory telegram when the netherlands surrendered in may  my fuhrer i congratulate you and hope that under your marvellous leadership the german monarchy will be restored completely hitler was reportedly exasperated and bemused and remarked to linge his valet what an idiot in another telegram to hitler upon the fall of paris a month later wilhelm stated congratulations you have won using my troops in a letter to his daughter victoria louise duchess of brunswick he wrote triumphantly thus is the pernicious entente cordiale of uncle edward vii brought to nought nevertheless after the nazi conquest of the netherlands in  the aging wilhelm retired completely from public life in may  when hitler invaded the netherlands wilhelm declined an offer from churchill of asylum in britain preferring to die at huis doorn during his last year at doorn wilhelm believed that germany was the land of monarchy and therefore of christ and that england was the land of liberalism and therefore of satan and the antichrist he argued that the english ruling classes were freemasons thoroughly infected by juda wilhelm asserted that the british people must be liberated from antichrist juda we must drive juda out of england just as he has been chased out of the continentclarification needed he believed the freemasons and jews had caused the two world wars aiming at a world jewish empire with british and american gold but that judas plan has been smashed to pieces and they themselves swept out of the european continent continental europe was now wilhelm wrote consolidating and closing itself off from british influences after the elimination of the british and the jews the end result would be a us of europeclarification needed in a letter of  to his sister princess margaret wilhelm wrote the hand of god is creating a new world  working miracles we are becoming the us of europe under german leadership a united european continent he added the jews are being thrust out of their nefarious positions in all countries whom they have driven to hostility for centuries also in  came what would have been his mothers th birthday on which he wrote ironically to a friend today the th birthday of my mother no notice is taken of it at home no memorial service or committee to remember her marvellous work for the welfare of our german people nobody of the new generation knows anything about her this sympathy for his mother is in sharp contrast to the intense animosity he expressed for her during most of her lifecitation needed the huis doorn in  wilhelm in  huis doorn in the netherlands death wilhelm iis tomb in doorn netherlands wilhelm died of a pulmonary embolus in doorn netherlands on  june  aged  just weeks before the axis invasion of the soviet union german soldiers had been guarding his house hitler however was reportedby whom to be angry that the former monarch had an honor guard of german troops and nearly fired the general who ordered them when he found out despite his personal animosity toward wilhelm hitler wanted to bring his body back to berlin for a state funeral as wilhelm was a symbol of germany and germans during the previous world war hitler felt that such a funeral would demonstrate to the germans the direct descent of the third reich from the old german empire however wilhelms wishes never to return to germany until the restoration of the monarchy were respected and the nazi occupation authorities granted him a small military funeral with a few hundred people present the mourners included august von mackensen fully dressed in his old imperial life hussars uniform admiral wilhelm canaris and reichskommissar for the netherlands arthur seyssinquart along with a few other military advisers however wilhelms request that the swastika and other nazi regalia be not displayed at his funeral was ignored and they are featured in the photographs of the event taken by a dutch photographer wilhelm was buried in a mausoleum in the grounds of huis doorn which has since become a place of pilgrimage for german monarchists small but enthusiastic and faithful numbers of them gather there every year on the anniversary of his death to pay their homage to the last german emperor historiography three trends have characterized the writing about wilhelm first the courtinspired writers considered him a martyr and a hero often uncritically accepting the justifications provided in the kaisers own memoirs second there came those who judged wilhelm to be completely unable to handle the great responsibilities of his position a ruler too reckless to deal with power third after  later scholars have sought to transcend the passions of the early th century and attempted an objective portrayal of wilhelm and his rule on  june  a year before the great war began the new york times published a special supplement devoted to the th anniversary of the kaisers coronation the banner headline read kaiser  years a ruler hailed as chief peacemaker the accompanying story called him the greatest factor for peace that our time can show and credited wilhelm with frequently rescuing europe from the brink of war until the late s the kaiser was depicted by most historians as a man of considerable influence partly that was a deception by german officials for example president theodore roosevelt believed the kaiser was in control of german foreign policy because hermann speck von sternburg the german ambassador in washington and a personal friend of roosevelt presented to the president messages from chancellor von bülow as messages from the kaiser later historians downplayed his role arguing that senior officials learned to work around him more recently historian john c g röhl has portrayed wilhelm as the key figure in understanding the recklessness and downfall of imperial germany thus the argument is made that the kaiser played a major role in promoting the policies of naval and colonial expansion that caused the sharp deterioration in germanys relations with britain before  first marriage and issue wilhelm and his first wife augusta viktoria wilhelm and his first wife

first use i made a schichtorte last night which is what id been waiting for this pan for time to release the cake and the walls wouldnt move got the cake out of there by upending it  good thing my first bake in it wasnt a cheesecake  cleaned it out to try to figure out what ails this thing well i still cant figure it out other than that it apparently cant take the heat theres no batter there to

note the size is incorrect this is not an  pan as advertised but rather about a  frankly this tiny quantity change makes no difference to my cake the pan and buckle are hefty and strong there is no

pan sizes are wrong if you have a laforme  pan what you really have is a   pan ive contacted the company about this and at first they insisted the  pan is  but when pressed they admitted its not  oops and must be from the european conversion okthen dont put a label on a   pan that says its  for what these pans cost if i buy one that says its  then the interior measurement had better be  or within a

recognizable public figures of world war i  he gained a reputation as a swaggering militarist through his speeches and illadvised newspaper interviews while wilhelm did not actively seek war and tried to hold back his generals from mobilizing the german army in the summer of  his verbal outbursts and his open enjoyment of the title of supreme war lord helped bolster the case of those who blamed him for the conflict his role in the conduct of the war as well as his responsibility for its outbreak is still controversial some historians maintain that wilhelm was controlled by his generals while others argue that he retained considerable political power in late  he was forced to abdicate he spent the rest of his life in exile in the netherlands where he died at age  play video world war i

potsdam germany on january   the son of prince frederick wilhelm of prussia  and princess victoria  the oldest daughter of queen victoria of england  the future monarch was the queen’s firstborn grandchild and was genuinely fond of her in fact he was holding her in his arms when she died his ties to britain through its royal family would play an important part in his later political maneuvering did you know kaiser wilhelm ii was reportedly amused when he heard his cousin king george v  had changed the name of the british royal family from saxecoburggotha to windsor in  as a result of antigerman sentiment in britain during world war iwilhelm’s childhood was shaped by two events one medical and one political his birth had been traumatic in the course of a complicated delivery the doctor permanently damaged wilhelm’s left arm in addition to its smaller size the arm was useless for such ordinary tasks as cutting certain foods with a knife at mealtime the political event that shaped wilhelm was the formation of the german empire under the leadership of prussia in  wilhelm was now second in line after his father to become an emperor as well as king of prussia twelve years old at the time wilhelm was filled with nationalistic enthusiasm his later determination to win a “place in the sun” for germany had its roots in his childhood an intelligent young man who possessed a lifelong interest in science and technology wilhelm was educated at the university of bonn his quick mind however was combined with an even quicker temper and an impulsive highstrung personality he had dysfunctional relationships with both parents particularly his english mother historians still debate the effects of the kaiser’s complicated psychological makeup on his political decisions in  wilhelm married princess augusta victoria  of schleswigholstein the couple would go on to have seven children emperor and king  wilhelm’s father became kaiser frederick iii of germany in march  already ill with terminal throat cancer he died after a reign of only several months wilhelm succeeded his father on june   at the age of  within two years of his coronation wilhelm broke with otto von bismarck  the “iron chancellor” who had dominated german politics since the s the kaiser embarked on his socalled new course a period of personal rule in which he appointed chancellors who were upperlevel civil servants rather than statesmen bismarck bitterly predicted that wilhelm would lead germany to ruin wilhelm damaged his political position in a number of ways he meddled in german foreign policy on the basis of his emotions resulting in incoherence and inconsistency in german relations with other nations he also made a number of public blunders the worst of which was the daily telegraph affair of  wilhelm gave an interview to the londonbased newspaper in which he offended the british by saying such things as “you english are mad mad mad as march hares” the kaiser had already been hurt politically in  by the eulenburgharden affair in which members of his circle of friends were accused of being homosexuals although there is no evidence that wilhelm was gay–in addition to his seven children with his first wife he was rumored to have several illegitimate offspring–the scandal was used by his political opponents to weaken his influencewilhelm’s most important contribution to germany’s prewar military expansion was his commitment to creating a navy to rival britain’s his childhood visits to his british cousins had given him a love for the sea–sailing was one of his favorite recreations–and his envy of the power of the british navy convinced him that germany must build a large fleet of its own in order to fulfill its destiny the kaiser supported the plans of alfred von tirpitz  his chief admiral who maintained that germany could gain diplomatic power over britain by stationing a fleet of warships in the north sea by  however the naval buildup had caused severe financial problems for wilhelm’s government kaiser wilhelm ii and world war i wilhelm’s behavior during the crisis that led to war in august  is still controversial there is little doubt that he had been broken psychologically by the criticism that followed the eulenburgharden and daily telegraph scandals he suffered an episode of depression in  in addition the kaiser was out of touch with the realities of international politics in  he thought that his blood relationships to other european monarchs were sufficient to manage the crisis that followed the june  assassination of the austrian archduke franz ferdinand  in sarajevo bosnia although wilhelm signed the order for german mobilization following pressure from his generals–germany declared war against russia and france during the first week of august – he is reported to have said “you will regret this gentlemen” with world war i under way the kaiser as commander in chief of the german armed forces retained the power to make upperlevel changes in military command nonetheless he was largely a shadow monarch during the war useful to his generals as a publicrelations figure who toured the front lines and handed out medals after  germany was in effect a military dictatorship dominated by two generals paul von hindenburg  and erich ludendorff  kaiser wilhelm ii’s years of exile in late  popular unrest in germany which had suffered greatly during the war combined with a naval mutiny convinced civilian political leaders that the kaiser had to abdicate to preserve order in fact wilhelm’s abdication was announced on november   before he had actually consented to it he agreed to leave when the leaders of the army told him he had lost their support as well on november  the former emperor took a train across the border into the netherlands which had remained neutral throughout the war he eventually bought a manor house in the town of doorn and remained there for the remainder of his life although the allies wanted to punish wilhelm as a war criminal queen wilhelmina of the netherlands  refused to extradite him his last years were darkened by the death of his first wife and the suicide of his youngest son in  he did however make a happy second marriage in  his new wife hermine reuss  actively petitioned german leader adolf hitler  in the early s to restore the monarchy but nothing ever came of her negotiations hitler despised the man he held responsible for germany’s defeat in world war i and wilhelm was shocked by the nazis’ thuggish tactics in  wilhelm remarked that for the first time he was ashamed to be a german after two decades in exile he died in the netherlands on june   at the age of  tags wilhelm ii world war i world war i leaders tags wilhelm ii world war i world war i leaders

your vision may be affected and your eyes may be lightsensitive when they are dilated dilation normally lasts for several hours after the exam you may be more comfortable wearing sunglasses if you do not have sunglasses with you we can give you a dark insert for your glasses before you leave the clinic if you have had difficulty in the past or you feel uncomfortable about driving after your appointment you may wish to use public transportation or bring a driver with you however many people feel they can drive even after they are dilated i’m over  and i’ve noticed i’m having trouble reading small print what should i do it is normal for near closeup vision to decline gradually after the age of  this condition is called presbyopia presbyopia occurs in most individuals around the age of  to  years this develops because the lens inside the eye loses its ability to change shape and allow near focusing people compensate for presbyopia by using bifocals and reading glasses if you are noticing this please make an appointment with one of our optometrists who will help you decide when and whether reading glasses would be helpful for you how can i keep my eyes healthy the lifestyle choices that are good for overall health are also good for your eyes we recommend that you exercise regularly eat a healthy diet and get your routine health screenings if you smoke quitting is one of the best things you can do for your overall health and the health of your eyes we also recommend wearing uv blocking sunglasses to protect your eyes what can i do when my eyes feel scratchy and gritty the most common cause of scratchy irritated eyes is dry eye syndrome dry eye syndrome can also cause the eyes to sting and burn feel gritty or sandy and feel irritated in addition dry eyes can cause intermittent blurred vision and sensitivity to light if you experience dry eyes you can use overthecounter artificial tears as needed to ease your symptoms this is especially important with prolonged reading or computer use when your eyes are more likely to become dry is it safe to use eye drops that say they “get the red out” generally we do not recommend these eye drops as they can lead to eye irritation over time what can i do when allergies make my eyes red itchy and watery there are good overthecounter antihistamine drops such as ketotifen zaditor and others to help with symptoms of seasonal and other allergies refrigerated artificial tears and cool compresses can also help is it ok to rub my eyes in general we advise that you not rub your eyes especially after surgery or a procedure please also refer above to other questions and answers if your eyes are dry itchy or feel strained what if i put in more drops than instructed by my doctor the eye can hold only about a drop of medicine and after this it will overflow as tears occasionally putting in an extra drop is not harmful is it ok to wear contact lenses throughout the night while sleeping you should never sleep in your contact lenses even the extendedwear type this increases your risk of corneal infections or inflammation the only exceptions are bandage contact lenses that your eye doctor has placed on your eyes for a specific purpose what happens if i miss my eye altogether when putting drops in we advise you to instill another eyedrop to ensure the drop takes effect it is generally better to put  drops in than none at all as your eye blinks out any excess solution health tools office visit office visit table of contents getting here before your visit during your visit after your
