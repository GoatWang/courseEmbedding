effect profile more constant therapeutic effect benefits of improved drug delivery improving clinical outcomes  maximizing returns drug reformulation of existing molecules plays a key role in improving patient compliance and improving clinical outcomes it also enables a molecule’s full commercial potential to be recognized as such it is vital in maximizing returns on investment key objectives of drug reformulation include extending the scope of the drug ie indication routes of administration improving efficacy improving ease of administration extending patent life improving the product’s competitive profile  revitalizing your product drug reformulation reveals a number of marketing opportunities at different stages of the product lifecycle that help to achieve strategic goals employing mayne pharma’s proprietary technology to manage the product life cycle may allow opportunities for new regulatory exclusivity and intellectual property and hence extend the period of marketing exclusivity for the product while providing additional patient benefits product lifecycle opportunities include increased commercial potential of a molecule is enabled through expanding the scope ie new indications accessing new segments of patient populations new sales opportunities enabled by new and differentiated formulations extended patent protection for a competitively differentiated formulation reformulation of an off patent drug to capture market share andor grow the market for the drug maximizing returns on new chemical entities nce many nces fail to reach the market as an oral dose form due to inadequate physicochemical or biopharmaceutical properties eg high variability andor low absorption short half life etc this results in candidate failure or development of the nce in a less preferred route such deficiencies may be addressed with the application of mayne pharma’s drug delivery technologies which can help to diminish such inadequacies
