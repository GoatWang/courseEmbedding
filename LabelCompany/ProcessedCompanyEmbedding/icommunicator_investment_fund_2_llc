vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds the managed payout fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives is subject to loss and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital the dollar amount of the funds monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time it is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its manageddistribution policy an investment in the fund could lose money over short intermediate or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market the fund is proportionately
