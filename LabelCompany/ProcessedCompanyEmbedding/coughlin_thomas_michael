attention to detail for example at the start of his giants tenure he fined players for being two minutes early to team meetings saying they should have arrived at least five minutes early per his new rules earning him the nickname colonel coughlin coaching careeredit coughlins first head coaching job was at the rochester institute of technology from – he then returned to his alma mater where he

boston college to take on his second job as a head coach in three seasons at boston college he turned the program into a consistent winner coughlins tenure was capped with a – victory over  ranked notre dame in  the first time boston college defeated notre dame jacksonville jaguars –edit coughlins success at boston college led to his subsequent hiring as the first head coach of the nfls expansion jacksonville jaguars in eight seasons at jacksonville he helmed the most successful expansion team in league history during coughlins tenure the jaguars made four consecutive playoff appearances and went to the afc championship game twice the first time in only the second year of the teams existence  the jaguars qualified for the playoffs on the last day of the season and upset the heavily favored buffalo bills and denver broncos on the road he was named nfl coach of the year by united press international coughlin would again take the jaguars to the afc championship game in  after achieving a leaguehigh – regular season record the  wins stood as the most won by the current wave of expansion teams the jaguars carolina panthers baltimore ravens and houston texans until the panthers surpassed it in  however in both appearances in the championship game the jaguars were defeated in  by the new england patriots and in  by the tennessee titans coughlins jaguars won  regular season games in his first five years as head coach a remarkable average for an expansion team of nearly ten wins per year but the jaguars record for the next three years was only – and after a – finish in  coughlin was fired by owner wayne weaver he finished his eightyear career in jacksonville with a – regular season record and a – playoff record in  after selling the jaguars to shahid khan weaver said when looking back on his tenure as owner one of his biggest regrets was firing coughlin new york giants –edit early years –edit after being out of football in  coughlin was hired to replace jim fassel as head coach of the new york giants in january  he inherited a team that finished – in  as coughlin took over the giants were trying to put together a trade for the first pick in the draft that year the san diego chargers held that pick and the expected selection was mississippi quarterback eli manning who had made his desire clear that he wanted to play for the giants on draft day the giants drafted nc states philip rivers with the fourth pick and traded him to the chargers for manning coughlins incumbent quarterback kerry collins was incensed by the move and demanded his release leaving the team without a veteran who could hold the fort until manning was ready to fill that role the giants signed kurt warner the former super bowl mvp who had been cut by the st louis rams after he lost his starting job to marc bulger behind warner coughlin led the giants to five wins in their first seven games however with the team having lost their next two coughlin decided that warner who had been struggling could no longer do the job and began starting the highly touted manning beginning in the tenth game the coach received criticism from some who felt the move amounted to a surrender of the  season as their – record meant the giants were still in playoff contention manning did in fact struggle and the giants losing streak reached eight games before manning defeated the dallas cowboys in the final game of the season another major impact coughlin would have on the giants was star running back tiki barbers fumbling problems in the – seasons barber lost the ball  times by simply teaching barber to use a different grip on the ball coughlin reduced barbers fumbles to only one in the  season barber also saw his production increase significantly setting career highs in rushing and total yards each year under coughlin coughlins early move to manning though would pay dividends in  as manning and the giants went – in coughlins second season and won the nfc east for the first time since  it was also the giants first postseason appearance since making it as a wild card in  however a very poor performance by manning and a defense missing three starting linebackers saw the giants get shut out – at the hands of the carolina panthers at giants stadium following the game tiki barber called out coughlin and his offensive coordinator partially because a panthers player said that we knew what they were going to do before they did it coughlin and barber have yet to reconcile their differences with coughlin even refusing an interview by tiki then a sideline reporter for nbc which would have been held prior to a panthers–giants game in  new york giants gm jerry reese defensive coordinator steve spagnuolo offensive coordinator kevin gilbride  coughlin at giants stadium heading into the  season expectations for the giants were high in just over two years as the giants head coach coughlin transformed the giants from an underachieving last place team into a possible super bowl contender the giants struggled early during the  campaign going – in their first three games after a particularly bad loss to the seattle seahawks star tight end jeremy shockey stated that the giants had been outplayed and outcoached the giants rebounded by winning their next five games to go – however the giants suffered a stunning second half collapse losing  of their next  games to fall to – heading into the last game of the season after a late november loss to the jacksonville jaguars coughlin and his coaching staff were once again criticized by tiki barber barber also announced he was going to retire following the season which provided another distraction for the sliding giants things took another turn for the worse the next week when the giants blew a point fourth quarter lead and lost to the tennessee titans by a score of – after the game coughlin had said to the media im going to be sick about this one forever numerous injuries excessive penalties and a high number of turnovers were most responsible for the downward spiral of the  giants the media hounded coughlin with questions about barbers announcement and whether differences between coughlin and barber led to this point and the teams fans and ownership were starting to get restless about the coachs performance during a – loss to the new orleans saints late in the year a loud fire coughlin chant erupted at giants stadium the giants rebounded with a victory in the seasons final game at the washington redskins thereby securing a playoff berth and perhaps saving coughlins job in the process however coughlin and the giants lost to the philadelphia eagles – in the first round of the playoffs on january   it was announced that coughlin would receive a oneyear extension on his current contract through the  season but since the giants team policy is to never have a coach in the final year of his contract this only guaranteed that coughlin would remain as the giants head coach in  on february   tiki barber officially followed through on his threat to retire from the giants he cited numerous complaints about eli mannings leadership skills and coughlins

coughlin was wide receivers coach and parcells was head coach for the new york giants like his mentor coughlin is known as a stern disciplinarian and for his meticulous attention to detail for example at the start of his giants tenure he fined players for being two minutes early to team meetings saying they should have arrived at least five minutes early per his new rules earning him the nickname colonel coughlin coaching careeredit coughlins first head coaching job was at the rochester institute of technology from – he then returned to his alma mater where he was eventually promoted to offensive coordinator a position he also held at boston college where he coached doug flutie he returned to the staff after his stint at the rochester institute of technology coughlins second stint

job as a head coach in three seasons at boston college he turned the program into a consistent winner coughlins tenure was capped with a – victory over  ranked notre dame in  the first time boston college defeated notre dame jacksonville jaguars –edit coughlins success at boston college led to his subsequent hiring as the first head coach of the nfls expansion jacksonville jaguars in eight seasons at jacksonville he helmed the most successful expansion team in league history during coughlins tenure the jaguars made four consecutive playoff appearances and went to the afc championship game twice the first time in only the second year of the teams existence  the jaguars qualified for the playoffs on the last day of the season and upset the heavily favored buffalo bills and denver broncos on the road he was named nfl coach of the year by united press international coughlin would again take the jaguars to the afc championship game in  after achieving a leaguehigh – regular season record the  wins stood as the most won by the current wave of expansion teams the jaguars carolina panthers baltimore ravens and houston texans until the panthers surpassed it in  however in both appearances in the championship game the jaguars were defeated in  by the new england patriots and in  by the tennessee titans coughlins jaguars won  regular season games in his first five years as head coach a remarkable average for an expansion team of nearly ten wins per year but the jaguars record for the next three years was only – and after a – finish in  coughlin was fired by owner wayne weaver he finished his eightyear career in jacksonville with a – regular season record and a – playoff record in  after selling the jaguars to shahid khan weaver said when looking back on his tenure as owner one of his biggest regrets was firing coughlin new york giants –edit early years –edit after being out of football in  coughlin was hired to replace jim fassel as head coach of the new york giants in january  he inherited a team that finished – in  as coughlin took over the giants were trying to put together a trade for the first pick in the draft that year the san diego chargers held that pick and the expected selection was mississippi quarterback eli manning who had made his desire clear that he wanted to play for the giants on draft day the giants drafted nc states philip rivers with the fourth pick and traded him to the chargers for manning coughlins incumbent quarterback kerry collins was incensed by the move and demanded his release leaving the team without a veteran who could hold the fort until manning was ready to fill that role the giants signed kurt warner the former super bowl mvp who had been cut by the st louis rams after he lost his starting job to marc bulger behind warner coughlin led the giants to five wins in their first seven games however with the team having lost their next two coughlin decided that warner who had been struggling could no longer do the job and began starting the highly touted manning beginning in the tenth game the coach received criticism from some who felt the move amounted to a surrender of the  season as their – record meant the giants were still in playoff contention manning did in fact struggle and the giants losing streak reached eight games before manning defeated the dallas cowboys in the final game of the season another major impact coughlin would have on the giants was star running back tiki barbers fumbling problems in the – seasons barber lost the ball  times by simply teaching barber to use a different grip on the ball coughlin reduced barbers fumbles to only one in the  season barber also saw his production increase significantly setting career highs in rushing and total yards each year under coughlin coughlins early move to manning though would pay dividends in  as manning and the giants went – in coughlins second season and won the nfc east for the first time since  it was also the giants first postseason appearance since making it as a wild card in  however a very poor performance by manning and a defense missing three starting linebackers saw the giants get shut out – at the hands of the carolina panthers at giants stadium following the game tiki barber called out coughlin and his offensive coordinator partially because a panthers player said that we knew what they were going to do before they did it coughlin and barber have yet to reconcile their differences with coughlin even refusing an interview by tiki then a sideline reporter for nbc which would have been held prior to a panthers–giants game in  new york giants gm jerry reese defensive coordinator steve spagnuolo offensive coordinator kevin gilbride  coughlin at giants stadium heading into the  season expectations for the giants were high in just over two years as the giants head coach coughlin transformed the giants from an underachieving last place team into a possible super bowl contender the giants struggled early during the  campaign going – in their first three games after a particularly bad loss to the seattle seahawks star tight end jeremy shockey stated that the giants had been outplayed and outcoached the giants rebounded by winning their next five games to go – however the giants suffered a stunning second half collapse losing  of their next  games to fall to – heading into the last game of the season after a late november loss to the jacksonville jaguars coughlin and his coaching staff were once again criticized by tiki barber barber also announced he was going to retire following the season which provided another distraction for the sliding giants things took another turn for the worse the next week when the giants blew a point fourth quarter lead and lost to the tennessee titans by a score of – after the game coughlin had said to the media im going to be sick about this one forever numerous injuries excessive penalties and a high number of turnovers were most responsible for the downward spiral of the  giants the media hounded coughlin with questions about barbers announcement and whether differences between coughlin and barber led to this point and the teams fans and ownership were starting to get restless about the coachs performance during a – loss to the new orleans saints late in the year a loud fire coughlin chant erupted at giants stadium the giants rebounded with a victory in the seasons final game at the washington redskins thereby securing a playoff berth and perhaps saving coughlins job in the process however coughlin and the giants lost to the philadelphia eagles – in the first round of the playoffs on january   it was announced that coughlin would receive a oneyear extension on his current contract through the  season but since the giants team policy is to never have a coach in the final year of his contract this only guaranteed that coughlin would remain as the giants head coach in  on february   tiki barber officially followed through on his threat to retire from the giants he cited numerous complaints about eli mannings leadership skills and coughlins practice style as decisions to retire at what seemed the peak of his career super bowl run and success –edit coughlin with president bush on april   in the  season the giants again started poorly with an – record however the team rebounded and won  straight games the team compiled a  road record for the season and they made it to the playoffs for the third year in a row coughlin and the giants had their first playoff win in seven years when his team defeated the tampa bay buccaneers on january   – the giants immediately followed up their win against tampa bay by narrowly defeating the dallas cowboys in the divisional playoffs winning – preventing dallas from beating them for the third time in the season the upset victory over the cowboys was followed up by a – overtime victory against the green bay packers in the nfc championship

parcells was head coach for the new york giants like his mentor coughlin is known as a stern disciplinarian and for his meticulous attention to detail for example at the start of his giants tenure he fined players for being two minutes early to team meetings saying they should have arrived at least five minutes early per his new rules earning him the nickname colonel coughlin coaching careeredit coughlins first head coaching job was at the rochester institute of technology from – he then returned to his alma mater where he was eventually promoted to offensive coordinator a position he also held at boston college where he coached doug flutie he returned to the staff after his stint at the rochester institute of technology coughlins second stint started in  and ended in  he left the

helped the giants win super bowl xxv coughlin and parcells have both made the nfl playoffs five times as giants head coach and the two super bowl titles they each have won with the giants have occurred in their fourth and eighth seasons with the franchise respectively boston collegeedit after the  season coughlin returned to boston college to take on his second job as a head coach in three seasons at boston college he turned the program into a consistent winner coughlins tenure was capped with a – victory over  ranked notre dame in  the first time boston college defeated notre dame jacksonville jaguars –edit coughlins success at boston college led to his subsequent hiring as the first head coach of the nfls expansion jacksonville jaguars in eight seasons at jacksonville he helmed the most successful expansion team in league history during coughlins tenure the jaguars made four consecutive playoff appearances and went to the afc championship game twice the first time in only the second year of the teams existence  the jaguars qualified for the playoffs on the last day of the season and upset the heavily favored buffalo bills and denver broncos on the road he was named nfl coach of the year by united press international coughlin would again take the jaguars to the afc championship game in  after achieving a leaguehigh – regular season record the  wins stood as the most won by the current wave of expansion teams the jaguars carolina panthers baltimore ravens and houston texans until the panthers surpassed it in  however in both appearances in the championship game the jaguars were defeated in  by the new england patriots and in  by the tennessee titans coughlins jaguars won  regular season games in his first five years as head coach a remarkable average for an expansion team of nearly ten wins per year but the jaguars record for the next three years was only – and after a – finish in  coughlin was fired by owner wayne weaver he finished his eightyear career in jacksonville with a – regular season record and a – playoff record in  after selling the jaguars to shahid khan weaver said when looking back on his tenure as owner one of his biggest regrets was firing coughlin new york giants –edit early years –edit after being out of football in  coughlin was hired to replace jim fassel as head coach of the new york giants in january  he inherited a team that finished – in  as coughlin took over the giants were trying to put together a trade for the first pick in the draft that year the san diego chargers held that pick and the expected selection was mississippi quarterback eli manning who had made his desire clear that he wanted to play for the giants on draft day the giants drafted nc states philip rivers with the fourth pick and traded him to the chargers for manning coughlins incumbent quarterback kerry collins was incensed by the move and demanded his release leaving the team without a veteran who could hold the fort until manning was ready to fill that role the giants signed kurt warner the former super bowl mvp who had been cut by the st louis rams after he lost his starting job to marc bulger behind warner coughlin led the giants to five wins in their first seven games however with the team having lost their next two coughlin decided that warner who had been struggling could no longer do the job and began starting the highly touted manning beginning in the tenth game the coach received criticism from some who felt the move amounted to a surrender of the  season as their – record meant the giants were still in playoff contention manning did in fact struggle and the giants losing streak reached eight games before manning defeated the dallas cowboys in the final game of the season another major impact coughlin would have on the giants was star running back tiki barbers fumbling problems in the – seasons barber lost the ball  times by simply teaching barber to use a different grip on the ball coughlin reduced barbers fumbles to only one in the  season barber also saw his production increase significantly setting career highs in rushing and total yards each year under coughlin coughlins early move to manning though would pay dividends in  as manning and the giants went – in coughlins second season and won the nfc east for the first time since  it was also the giants first postseason appearance since making it as a wild card in  however a very poor performance by manning and a defense missing three starting linebackers saw the giants get shut out – at the hands of the carolina panthers at giants stadium following the game tiki barber called out coughlin and his offensive coordinator partially because a panthers player said that we knew what they were going to do before they did it coughlin and barber have yet to reconcile their differences with coughlin even refusing an interview by tiki then a sideline reporter for nbc which would have been held prior to a panthers–giants game in  new york giants gm jerry reese defensive coordinator steve spagnuolo offensive coordinator kevin gilbride  coughlin at giants stadium heading into the  season expectations for the giants were high in just over two years as the giants head coach coughlin transformed the giants from an underachieving last place team into a possible super bowl contender the giants struggled early during the  campaign going – in their first three games after a particularly bad loss to the seattle seahawks star tight end jeremy shockey stated that the giants had been outplayed and outcoached the giants rebounded by winning their next five games to go – however the giants suffered a stunning second half collapse losing  of their next  games to fall to – heading into the last game of the season after a late november loss to the jacksonville jaguars coughlin and his coaching staff were once again criticized by tiki barber barber also announced he was going to retire following the season which provided another distraction for the sliding giants things took another turn for the worse the next week when the giants blew a point fourth quarter lead and lost to the tennessee titans by a score of – after the game coughlin had said to the media im going to be sick about this one forever numerous injuries excessive penalties and a high number of turnovers were most responsible for the downward spiral of the  giants the media hounded coughlin with questions about barbers announcement and whether differences between coughlin and barber led to this point and the teams fans and ownership were starting to get restless about the coachs performance during a – loss to the new orleans saints late in the year a loud fire coughlin chant erupted at giants stadium the giants rebounded with a victory in the seasons final game at the washington redskins thereby securing a playoff berth and perhaps saving coughlins job in the process however coughlin and the giants lost to the philadelphia eagles – in the first round of the playoffs on january   it was announced that coughlin would receive a oneyear extension on his current contract through the  season but since the giants team policy is to never have a coach in the final year of his contract this only guaranteed that coughlin would remain as the giants head coach in  on february   tiki barber officially followed through on his threat to retire from the giants he cited numerous complaints about eli mannings leadership skills and coughlins practice style as decisions to retire at what seemed the peak of his career super bowl run and success –edit coughlin with president bush on april   in the  season the giants again started poorly with an – record however the team rebounded and won  straight games the team compiled a  road record for the season and they made it to the playoffs for the third year in a row coughlin and the giants had their first playoff win in seven years when his team defeated the tampa bay buccaneers on january   – the giants immediately followed up their win against tampa bay by narrowly defeating the dallas cowboys in the divisional playoffs winning – preventing dallas from beating them for the third time in the season the upset victory over the cowboys was followed up by a – overtime victory against the green bay packers in the nfc championship game this victory set up coughlins first appearance in a super bowl as a head coach super bowl xlii took place in glendale arizona on february   the game pitted coughlins new york giants – against the undefeated new england patriots – coached by bill belichick the patriots were favored by  points the underdog giants beat the patriots – in one of the biggest upsets in nfl history the upset would give coughlin his first super bowl ring as a head coach prior to the start of giants minicamp in may  coughlin and the giants were invited by president bush to the white house to honor their victory

parcells was head coach for the new york giants like his mentor coughlin is known as a stern disciplinarian and for his meticulous attention to detail for example at the start of his giants tenure he fined players for being two minutes early to team meetings saying they should have arrived at least five minutes early per his new rules earning him the nickname colonel coughlin coaching careeredit coughlins first head coaching job was at the rochester institute of technology from – he then returned to his alma mater where he was eventually promoted to offensive coordinator a position he also held at boston college where he coached doug flutie he returned to the staff after his stint at the rochester institute of technology coughlins second stint started in  and ended in  he left the

helped the giants win super bowl xxv coughlin and parcells have both made the nfl playoffs five times as giants head coach and the two super bowl titles they each have won with the giants have occurred in their fourth and eighth seasons with the franchise respectively boston collegeedit after the  season coughlin returned to boston college to take on his second job as a head coach in three seasons at boston college he turned the program into a consistent winner coughlins tenure was capped with a – victory over  ranked notre dame in  the first time boston college defeated notre dame jacksonville jaguars –edit coughlins success at boston college led to his subsequent hiring as the first head coach of the nfls expansion jacksonville jaguars in eight seasons at jacksonville he helmed the most successful expansion team in league history during coughlins tenure the jaguars made four consecutive playoff appearances and went to the afc championship game twice the first time in only the second year of the teams existence  the jaguars qualified for the playoffs on the last day of the season and upset the heavily favored buffalo bills and denver broncos on the road he was named nfl coach of the year by united press international coughlin would again take the jaguars to the afc championship game in  after achieving a leaguehigh – regular season record the  wins stood as the most won by the current wave of expansion teams the jaguars carolina panthers baltimore ravens and houston texans until the panthers surpassed it in  however in both appearances in the championship game the jaguars were defeated in  by the new england patriots and in  by the tennessee titans coughlins jaguars won  regular season games in his first five years as head coach a remarkable average for an expansion team of nearly ten wins per year but the jaguars record for the next three years was only – and after a – finish in  coughlin was fired by owner wayne weaver he finished his eightyear career in jacksonville with a – regular season record and a – playoff record in  after selling the jaguars to shahid khan weaver said when looking back on his tenure as owner one of his biggest regrets was firing coughlin new york giants –edit early years –edit after being out of football in  coughlin was hired to replace jim fassel as head coach of the new york giants in january  he inherited a team that finished – in  as coughlin took over the giants were trying to put together a trade for the first pick in the draft that year the san diego chargers held that pick and the expected selection was mississippi quarterback eli manning who had made his desire clear that he wanted to play for the giants on draft day the giants drafted nc states philip rivers with the fourth pick and traded him to the chargers for manning coughlins incumbent quarterback kerry collins was incensed by the move and demanded his release leaving the team without a veteran who could hold the fort until manning was ready to fill that role the giants signed kurt warner the former super bowl mvp who had been cut by the st louis rams after he lost his starting job to marc bulger behind warner coughlin led the giants to five wins in their first seven games however with the team having lost their next two coughlin decided that warner who had been struggling could no longer do the job and began starting the highly touted manning beginning in the tenth game the coach received criticism from some who felt the move amounted to a surrender of the  season as their – record meant the giants were still in playoff contention manning did in fact struggle and the giants losing streak reached eight games before manning defeated the dallas cowboys in the final game of the season another major impact coughlin would have on the giants was star running back tiki barbers fumbling problems in the – seasons barber lost the ball  times by simply teaching barber to use a different grip on the ball coughlin reduced barbers fumbles to only one in the  season barber also saw his production increase significantly setting career highs in rushing and total yards each year under coughlin coughlins early move to manning though would pay dividends in  as manning and the giants went – in coughlins second season and won the nfc east for the first time since  it was also the giants first postseason appearance since making it as a wild card in  however a very poor performance by manning and a defense missing three starting linebackers saw the giants get shut out – at the hands of the carolina panthers at giants stadium following the game tiki barber called out coughlin and his offensive coordinator partially because a panthers player said that we knew what they were going to do before they did it coughlin and barber have yet to reconcile their differences with coughlin even refusing an interview by tiki then a sideline reporter for nbc which would have been held prior to a panthers–giants game in  new york giants gm jerry reese defensive coordinator steve spagnuolo offensive coordinator kevin gilbride  coughlin at giants stadium heading into the  season expectations for the giants were high in just over two years as the giants head coach coughlin transformed the giants from an underachieving last place team into a possible super bowl contender the giants struggled early during the  campaign going – in their first three games after a particularly bad loss to the seattle seahawks star tight end jeremy shockey stated that the giants had been outplayed and outcoached the giants rebounded by winning their next five games to go – however the giants suffered a stunning second half collapse losing  of their next  games to fall to – heading into the last game of the season after a late november loss to the jacksonville jaguars coughlin and his coaching staff were once again criticized by tiki barber barber also announced he was going to retire following the season which provided another distraction for the sliding giants things took another turn for the worse the next week when the giants blew a point fourth quarter lead and lost to the tennessee titans by a score of – after the game coughlin had said to the media im going to be sick about this one forever numerous injuries excessive penalties and a high number of turnovers were most responsible for the downward spiral of the  giants the media hounded coughlin with questions about barbers announcement and whether differences between coughlin and barber led to this point and the teams fans and ownership were starting to get restless about the coachs performance during a – loss to the new orleans saints late in the year a loud fire coughlin chant erupted at giants stadium the giants rebounded with a victory in the seasons final game at the washington redskins thereby securing a playoff berth and perhaps saving coughlins job in the process however coughlin and the giants lost to the philadelphia eagles – in the first round of the playoffs on january   it was announced that coughlin would receive a oneyear extension on his current contract through the  season but since the giants team policy is to never have a coach in the final year of his contract this only guaranteed that coughlin would remain as the giants head coach in  on february   tiki barber officially followed through on his threat to retire from the giants he cited numerous complaints about eli mannings leadership skills and coughlins practice style as decisions to retire at what seemed the peak of his career super bowl run and success –edit coughlin with president bush on april   in the  season the giants again started poorly with an – record however the team rebounded and won  straight games the team compiled a  road record for the season and they made it to the playoffs for the third year in a row coughlin and the giants had their first playoff win in seven years when his team defeated the tampa bay buccaneers on january   – the giants immediately followed up their win against tampa bay by narrowly defeating the dallas cowboys in the divisional playoffs winning – preventing dallas from beating them for the third time in the season the upset victory over the cowboys was followed up by a – overtime victory against the green bay packers in the nfc championship game this victory set up coughlins first appearance in a super bowl as a head coach super bowl xlii took place in glendale arizona on february   the game pitted coughlins new york giants – against the undefeated new england patriots – coached by bill belichick the patriots were favored by  points the underdog giants beat the patriots – in one of the biggest upsets in nfl history the upset would give coughlin his first super bowl ring as a head coach prior to the start of giants minicamp in may  coughlin and the giants were invited by president bush to the white house to honor their victory in super bowl xlii the super bowl win got coughlin a fouryear contract worth roughly  million to coach the giants through  the deal made him one of the nfls highestpaid coaches fresh off their super bowl season the team started off red hot going – through  games but after the plaxico burress shooting incident the team went – down the stretch and despite being the  seed they were eliminated in the divisional round of the playoffs by the philadelphia eagles the giants finished – in  despite solid offensive play however their defense struggled throughout the season and they missed the playoffs in  they began – and then began a fivegame winning streak to finish – at the bye the giants headed into week  against the eagles with a record of – in the final seconds the giants were faced with a fourth down and coughlin told his punter matt dodge to punt the ball out of bounds to effectively end the game however he punted the ball right to desean jackson who took it the distance and won the eagles the game in the miracle at the new meadowlands the loss jeopardized the giants playoff bid and once again coughlins future was uncertain however on july   he signed a oneyear contract extension to remain with the giants through the end of the  season second super bowl run edit following a very hectic free agency period when the giants lost pro bowl wide receiver steve smith defensive tackle

parcells was head coach for the new york giants like his mentor coughlin is known as a stern disciplinarian and for his meticulous attention to detail for example at the start of his giants tenure he fined players for being two minutes early to team meetings saying they should have arrived at least five minutes early per his new rules earning him the nickname colonel coughlin coaching careeredit coughlins first head coaching job was at the rochester institute of technology from – he then returned to his alma mater where he was eventually promoted to offensive coordinator a position he also held at boston college where he coached doug flutie he returned to the staff after his stint at the rochester institute of technology coughlins second stint started in  and ended in  he left the

helped the giants win super bowl xxv coughlin and parcells have both made the nfl playoffs five times as giants head coach and the two super bowl titles they each have won with the giants have occurred in their fourth and eighth seasons with the franchise respectively boston collegeedit after the  season coughlin returned to boston college to take on his second job as a head coach in three seasons at boston college he turned the program into a consistent winner coughlins tenure was capped with a – victory over  ranked notre dame in  the first time boston college defeated notre dame jacksonville jaguars –edit coughlins success at boston college led to his subsequent hiring as the first head coach of the nfls expansion jacksonville jaguars in eight seasons at jacksonville he helmed the most successful expansion team in league history during coughlins tenure the jaguars made four consecutive playoff appearances and went to the afc championship game twice the first time in only the second year of the teams existence  the jaguars qualified for the playoffs on the last day of the season and upset the heavily favored buffalo bills and denver broncos on the road he was named nfl coach of the year by united press international coughlin would again take the jaguars to the afc championship game in  after achieving a leaguehigh – regular season record the  wins stood as the most won by the current wave of expansion teams the jaguars carolina panthers baltimore ravens and houston texans until the panthers surpassed it in  however in both appearances in the championship game the jaguars were defeated in  by the new england patriots and in  by the tennessee titans coughlins jaguars won  regular season games in his first five years as head coach a remarkable average for an expansion team of nearly ten wins per year but the jaguars record for the next three years was only – and after a – finish in  coughlin was fired by owner wayne weaver he finished his eightyear career in jacksonville with a – regular season record and a – playoff record in  after selling the jaguars to shahid khan weaver said when looking back on his tenure as owner one of his biggest regrets was firing coughlin new york giants –edit early years –edit after being out of football in  coughlin was hired to replace jim fassel as head coach of the new york giants in january  he inherited a team that finished – in  as coughlin took over the giants were trying to put together a trade for the first pick in the draft that year the san diego chargers held that pick and the expected selection was mississippi quarterback eli manning who had made his desire clear that he wanted to play for the giants on draft day the giants drafted nc states philip rivers with the fourth pick and traded him to the chargers for manning coughlins incumbent quarterback kerry collins was incensed by the move and demanded his release leaving the team without a veteran who could hold the fort until manning was ready to fill that role the giants signed kurt warner the former super bowl mvp who had been cut by the st louis rams after he lost his starting job to marc bulger behind warner coughlin led the giants to five wins in their first seven games however with the team having lost their next two coughlin decided that warner who had been struggling could no longer do the job and began starting the highly touted manning beginning in the tenth game the coach received criticism from some who felt the move amounted to a surrender of the  season as their – record meant the giants were still in playoff contention manning did in fact struggle and the giants losing streak reached eight games before manning defeated the dallas cowboys in the final game of the season another major impact coughlin would have on the giants was star running back tiki barbers fumbling problems in the – seasons barber lost the ball  times by simply teaching barber to use a different grip on the ball coughlin reduced barbers fumbles to only one in the  season barber also saw his production increase significantly setting career highs in rushing and total yards each year under coughlin coughlins early move to manning though would pay dividends in  as manning and the giants went – in coughlins second season and won the nfc east for the first time since  it was also the giants first postseason appearance since making it as a wild card in  however a very poor performance by manning and a defense missing three starting linebackers saw the giants get shut out – at the hands of the carolina panthers at giants stadium following the game tiki barber called out coughlin and his offensive coordinator partially because a panthers player said that we knew what they were going to do before they did it coughlin and barber have yet to reconcile their differences with coughlin even refusing an interview by tiki then a sideline reporter for nbc which would have been held prior to a panthers–giants game in  new york giants gm jerry reese defensive coordinator steve spagnuolo offensive coordinator kevin gilbride  coughlin at giants stadium heading into the  season expectations for the giants were high in just over two years as the giants head coach coughlin transformed the giants from an underachieving last place team into a possible super bowl contender the giants struggled early during the  campaign going – in their first three games after a particularly bad loss to the seattle seahawks star tight end jeremy shockey stated that the giants had been outplayed and outcoached the giants rebounded by winning their next five games to go – however the giants suffered a stunning second half collapse losing  of their next  games to fall to – heading into the last game of the season after a late november loss to the jacksonville jaguars coughlin and his coaching staff were once again criticized by tiki barber barber also announced he was going to retire following the season which provided another distraction for the sliding giants things took another turn for the worse the next week when the giants blew a point fourth quarter lead and lost to the tennessee titans by a score of – after the game coughlin had said to the media im going to be sick about this one forever numerous injuries excessive penalties and a high number of turnovers were most responsible for the downward spiral of the  giants the media hounded coughlin with questions about barbers announcement and whether differences between coughlin and barber led to this point and the teams fans and ownership were starting to get restless about the coachs performance during a – loss to the new orleans saints late in the year a loud fire coughlin chant erupted at giants stadium the giants rebounded with a victory in the seasons final game at the washington redskins thereby securing a playoff berth and perhaps saving coughlins job in the process however coughlin and the giants lost to the philadelphia eagles – in the first round of the playoffs on january   it was announced that coughlin would receive a oneyear extension on his current contract through the  season but since the giants team policy is to never have a coach in the final year of his contract this only guaranteed that coughlin would remain as the giants head coach in  on february   tiki barber officially followed through on his threat to retire from the giants he cited numerous complaints about eli mannings leadership skills and coughlins practice style as decisions to retire at what seemed the peak of his career super bowl run and success –edit coughlin with president bush on april   in the  season the giants again started poorly with an – record however the team rebounded and won  straight games the team compiled a  road record for the season and they made it to the playoffs for the third year in a row coughlin and the giants had their first playoff win in seven years when his team defeated the tampa bay buccaneers on january   – the giants immediately followed up their win against tampa bay by narrowly defeating the dallas cowboys in the divisional playoffs winning – preventing dallas from beating them for the third time in the season the upset victory over the cowboys was followed up by a – overtime victory against the green bay packers in the nfc championship game this victory set up coughlins first appearance in a super bowl as a head coach super bowl xlii took place in glendale arizona on february   the game pitted coughlins new york giants – against the undefeated new england patriots – coached by bill belichick the patriots were favored by  points the underdog giants beat the patriots – in one of the biggest upsets in nfl history the upset would give coughlin his first super bowl ring as a head coach prior to the start of giants minicamp in may  coughlin and the giants were invited by president bush to the white house to honor their victory in super bowl xlii the super bowl win got coughlin a fouryear contract worth roughly  million to coach the giants through  the deal made him one of the nfls highestpaid coaches fresh off their super bowl season the team started off red hot going – through  games but after the plaxico burress shooting incident the team went – down the stretch and despite being the  seed they were eliminated in the divisional round of the playoffs by the philadelphia eagles the giants finished – in  despite solid offensive play however their defense struggled throughout the season and they missed the playoffs in  they began – and then began a fivegame winning streak to finish – at the bye the giants headed into week  against the eagles with a record of – in the final seconds the giants were faced with a fourth down and coughlin told his punter matt dodge to punt the ball out of bounds to effectively end the game however he punted the ball right to desean jackson who took it the distance and won the eagles the game in the miracle at the new meadowlands the loss jeopardized the giants playoff bid and once again coughlins future was uncertain however on july   he signed a oneyear contract extension to remain with the giants through the end of the  season second super bowl run edit following a very hectic free agency period when the giants lost pro bowl wide receiver steve smith defensive tackle barry cofield and tight end kevin boss expectations from many analysts and fans alike were very lowcitation needed after losing the season opener to the washington redskins in which the giants seemed worn out and tiredaccording to whom the giants went – before hitting a collapse losing four straight games at – the giants won three of their last four games to finish at – with the nfc east championship in their first playoff game since the  nfc divisional round they defeated the atlanta falcons – with the falcons only points coming on a first quarter safety on eli manning in the

record the following week he coached the giants to a – overtime victory over the san francisco ers in the nfc championship game to set up a super bowl rematch with the new england patriots on february   coughlins giants defeated the patriots – in super bowl xlvi thus making coughlin the oldest head coach to win a super bowl on june   it was announced he had signed a contract extension to keep him with the giants until at least  at the same time coughlin announced that he would like to coach into his seventies aftermath and playoff drought –edit unfortunately for coughlin the giants failed to make the playoffs in the  season despite starting the season – and finishing once again at – this was due in large part to two lopsided losses to the nfcs number one seed atlanta falcons and super

fined players for being two minutes early to team meetings saying they should have arrived at least five minutes early per his new rules earning him the nickname colonel coughlin coaching careeredit coughlins first head coaching job was at the rochester institute of technology from – he then returned to his alma mater where he was eventually promoted to offensive coordinator a position he also held at boston college where he coached doug flutie he returned to the staff after his stint at the rochester institute of technology coughlins second stint started in  and ended in  he left the

helped the giants win super bowl xxv coughlin and parcells have both made the nfl playoffs five times as giants head coach and the two super bowl titles they each have won with the giants have occurred in their fourth and eighth seasons with the franchise respectively boston collegeedit after the  season coughlin returned to boston college to take on his second job as a head coach in three seasons at boston college he turned the program into a consistent winner coughlins tenure was capped with a – victory over  ranked notre dame in  the first time boston college defeated notre dame jacksonville jaguars –edit coughlins success at boston college led to his subsequent hiring as the first head coach of the nfls expansion jacksonville jaguars in eight seasons at jacksonville he helmed the most successful expansion team in league history during coughlins tenure the jaguars made four consecutive playoff appearances and went to the afc championship game twice the first time in only the second year of the teams existence  the jaguars qualified for the playoffs on the last day of the season and upset the heavily favored buffalo bills and denver broncos on the road he was named nfl coach of the year by united press international coughlin would again take the jaguars to the afc championship game in  after achieving a leaguehigh – regular season record the  wins stood as the most won by the current wave of expansion teams the jaguars carolina panthers baltimore ravens and houston texans until the panthers surpassed it in  however in both appearances in the championship game the jaguars were defeated in  by the new england patriots and in  by the tennessee titans coughlins jaguars won  regular season games in his first five years as head coach a remarkable average for an expansion team of nearly ten wins per year but the jaguars record for the next three years was only – and after a – finish in  coughlin was fired by owner wayne weaver he finished his eightyear career in jacksonville with a – regular season record and a – playoff record in  after selling the jaguars to shahid khan weaver said when looking back on his tenure as owner one of his biggest regrets was firing coughlin new york giants –edit early years –edit after being out of football in  coughlin was hired to replace jim fassel as head coach of the new york giants in january  he inherited a team that finished – in  as coughlin took over the giants were trying to put together a trade for the first pick in the draft that year the san diego chargers held that pick and the expected selection was mississippi quarterback eli manning who had made his desire clear that he wanted to play for the giants on draft day the giants drafted nc states philip rivers with the fourth pick and traded him to the chargers for manning coughlins incumbent quarterback kerry collins was incensed by the move and demanded his release leaving the team without a veteran who could hold the fort until manning was ready to fill that role the giants signed kurt warner the former super bowl mvp who had been cut by the st louis rams after he lost his starting job to marc bulger behind warner coughlin led the giants to five wins in their first seven games however with the team having lost their next two coughlin decided that warner who had been struggling could no longer do the job and began starting the highly touted manning beginning in the tenth game the coach received criticism from some who felt the move amounted to a surrender of the  season as their – record meant the giants were still in playoff contention manning did in fact struggle and the giants losing streak reached eight games before manning defeated the dallas cowboys in the final game of the season another major impact coughlin would have on the giants was star running back tiki barbers fumbling problems in the – seasons barber lost the ball  times by simply teaching barber to use a different grip on the ball coughlin reduced barbers fumbles to only one in the  season barber also saw his production increase significantly setting career highs in rushing and total yards each year under coughlin coughlins early move to manning though would pay dividends in  as manning and the giants went – in coughlins second season and won the nfc east for the first time since  it was also the giants first postseason appearance since making it as a wild card in  however a very poor performance by manning and a defense missing three starting linebackers saw the giants get shut out – at the hands of the carolina panthers at giants stadium following the game tiki barber called out coughlin and his offensive coordinator partially because a panthers player said that we knew what they were going to do before they did it coughlin and barber have yet to reconcile their differences with coughlin even refusing an interview by tiki then a sideline reporter for nbc which would have been held prior to a panthers–giants game in  new york giants gm jerry reese defensive coordinator steve spagnuolo offensive coordinator kevin gilbride  coughlin at giants stadium heading into the  season expectations for the giants were high in just over two years as the giants head coach coughlin transformed the giants from an underachieving last place team into a possible super bowl contender the giants struggled early during the  campaign going – in their first three games after a particularly bad loss to the seattle seahawks star tight end jeremy shockey stated that the giants had been outplayed and outcoached the giants rebounded by winning their next five games to go – however the giants suffered a stunning second half collapse losing  of their next  games to fall to – heading into the last game of the season after a late november loss to the jacksonville jaguars coughlin and his coaching staff were once again criticized by tiki barber barber also announced he was going to retire following the season which provided another distraction for the sliding giants things took another turn for the worse the next week when the giants blew a point fourth quarter lead and lost to the tennessee titans by a score of – after the game coughlin had said to the media im going to be sick about this one forever numerous injuries excessive penalties and a high number of turnovers were most responsible for the downward spiral of the  giants the media hounded coughlin with questions about barbers announcement and whether differences between coughlin and barber led to this point and the teams fans and ownership were starting to get restless about the coachs performance during a – loss to the new orleans saints late in the year a loud fire coughlin chant erupted at giants stadium the giants rebounded with a victory in the seasons final game at the washington redskins thereby securing a playoff berth and perhaps saving coughlins job in the process however coughlin and the giants lost to the philadelphia eagles – in the first round of the playoffs on january   it was announced that coughlin would receive a oneyear extension on his current contract through the  season but since the giants team policy is to never have a coach in the final year of his contract this only guaranteed that coughlin would remain as the giants head coach in  on february   tiki barber officially followed through on his threat to retire from the giants he cited numerous complaints about eli mannings leadership skills and coughlins practice style as decisions to retire at what seemed the peak of his career super bowl run and success –edit coughlin with president bush on april   in the  season the giants again started poorly with an – record however the team rebounded and won  straight games the team compiled a  road record for the season and they made it to the playoffs for the third year in a row coughlin and the giants had their first playoff win in seven years when his team defeated the tampa bay buccaneers on january   – the giants immediately followed up their win against tampa bay by narrowly defeating the dallas cowboys in the divisional playoffs winning – preventing dallas from beating them for the third time in the season the upset victory over the cowboys was followed up by a – overtime victory against the green bay packers in the nfc championship game this victory set up coughlins first appearance in a super bowl as a head coach super bowl xlii took place in glendale arizona on february   the game pitted coughlins new york giants – against the undefeated new england patriots – coached by bill belichick the patriots were favored by  points the underdog giants beat the patriots – in one of the biggest upsets in nfl history the upset would give coughlin his first super bowl ring as a head coach prior to the start of giants minicamp in may  coughlin and the giants were invited by president bush to the white house to honor their victory in super bowl xlii the super bowl win got coughlin a fouryear contract worth roughly  million to coach the giants through  the deal made him one of the nfls highestpaid coaches fresh off their super bowl season the team started off red hot going – through  games but after the plaxico burress shooting incident the team went – down the stretch and despite being the  seed they were eliminated in the divisional round of the playoffs by the philadelphia eagles the giants finished – in  despite solid offensive play however their defense struggled throughout the season and they missed the playoffs in  they began – and then began a fivegame winning streak to finish – at the bye the giants headed into week  against the eagles with a record of – in the final seconds the giants were faced with a fourth down and coughlin told his punter matt dodge to punt the ball out of bounds to effectively end the game however he punted the ball right to desean jackson who took it the distance and won the eagles the game in the miracle at the new meadowlands the loss jeopardized the giants playoff bid and once again coughlins future was uncertain however on july   he signed a oneyear contract extension to remain with the giants through the end of the  season second super bowl run edit following a very hectic free agency period when the giants lost pro bowl wide receiver steve smith defensive tackle barry cofield and tight end kevin boss expectations from many analysts and fans alike were very lowcitation needed after losing the season opener to the washington redskins in which the giants seemed worn out and tiredaccording to whom the giants went – before hitting a collapse losing four straight games at – the giants won three of their last four games to finish at – with the nfc east championship in their first playoff game since the  nfc divisional round they defeated the atlanta falcons – with the falcons only points coming on a first quarter safety on eli manning in the

record the following week he coached the giants to a – overtime victory over the san francisco ers in the nfc championship game to set up a super bowl rematch with the new england patriots on february   coughlins giants defeated the patriots – in super bowl xlvi thus making coughlin the oldest head coach to win a super bowl on june   it was announced he had signed a contract extension to keep him with the giants until at least  at the same time coughlin announced that he would like to coach into his seventies aftermath and playoff drought –edit unfortunately for coughlin the giants failed to make the playoffs in the  season despite starting the season – and finishing once again at – this was due in large part to two lopsided losses to the nfcs number one seed atlanta falcons and super bowl champion baltimore ravens in weeks  and  respectively worse still the giants began the  season – for the first time since  john mara the giants coowner stated that coughlins time with the giants could be limited despite the difficult start the team remained resilient and rebounded with wins against the vikings and eagles hitting the bye week at – victories against the raiders and packers coupled with a floundering nfc east left the giants only one and half games behind the divisionleading eagles going into week  this resurgence was brought to an abrupt halt with a – loss against the division rival cowboys the giants eventually finished the  season with a record of – coughlins only sub  record as head coach since his first season and quarterback eli mannings rookie season in  on

  coughlin resigned from his position as head coach for the giants in a statement released by the giants that day coughlin wrote i met with john mara and steve tisch this afternoon and i informed them

fined players for being two minutes early to team meetings saying they should have arrived at least five minutes early per his new rules earning him the nickname colonel coughlin coaching careeredit coughlins first head coaching job was at the rochester institute of technology from – he then returned to his alma mater where he was eventually promoted to offensive coordinator a position he also held at boston college where he coached doug flutie he returned to the staff after his stint at the rochester institute of technology coughlins second stint started in  and ended in  he left the

helped the giants win super bowl xxv coughlin and parcells have both made the nfl playoffs five times as giants head coach and the two super bowl titles they each have won with the giants have occurred in their fourth and eighth seasons with the franchise respectively boston collegeedit after the  season coughlin returned to boston college to take on his second job as a head coach in three seasons at boston college he turned the program into a consistent winner coughlins tenure was capped with a – victory over  ranked notre dame in  the first time boston college defeated notre dame jacksonville jaguars –edit coughlins success at boston college led to his subsequent hiring as the first head coach of the nfls expansion jacksonville jaguars in eight seasons at jacksonville he helmed the most successful expansion team in league history during coughlins tenure the jaguars made four consecutive playoff appearances and went to the afc championship game twice the first time in only the second year of the teams existence  the jaguars qualified for the playoffs on the last day of the season and upset the heavily favored buffalo bills and denver broncos on the road he was named nfl coach of the year by united press international coughlin would again take the jaguars to the afc championship game in  after achieving a leaguehigh – regular season record the  wins stood as the most won by the current wave of expansion teams the jaguars carolina panthers baltimore ravens and houston texans until the panthers surpassed it in  however in both appearances in the championship game the jaguars were defeated in  by the new england patriots and in  by the tennessee titans coughlins jaguars won  regular season games in his first five years as head coach a remarkable average for an expansion team of nearly ten wins per year but the jaguars record for the next three years was only – and after a – finish in  coughlin was fired by owner wayne weaver he finished his eightyear career in jacksonville with a – regular season record and a – playoff record in  after selling the jaguars to shahid khan weaver said when looking back on his tenure as owner one of his biggest regrets was firing coughlin new york giants –edit early years –edit after being out of football in  coughlin was hired to replace jim fassel as head coach of the new york giants in january  he inherited a team that finished – in  as coughlin took over the giants were trying to put together a trade for the first pick in the draft that year the san diego chargers held that pick and the expected selection was mississippi quarterback eli manning who had made his desire clear that he wanted to play for the giants on draft day the giants drafted nc states philip rivers with the fourth pick and traded him to the chargers for manning coughlins incumbent quarterback kerry collins was incensed by the move and demanded his release leaving the team without a veteran who could hold the fort until manning was ready to fill that role the giants signed kurt warner the former super bowl mvp who had been cut by the st louis rams after he lost his starting job to marc bulger behind warner coughlin led the giants to five wins in their first seven games however with the team having lost their next two coughlin decided that warner who had been struggling could no longer do the job and began starting the highly touted manning beginning in the tenth game the coach received criticism from some who felt the move amounted to a surrender of the  season as their – record meant the giants were still in playoff contention manning did in fact struggle and the giants losing streak reached eight games before manning defeated the dallas cowboys in the final game of the season another major impact coughlin would have on the giants was star running back tiki barbers fumbling problems in the – seasons barber lost the ball  times by simply teaching barber to use a different grip on the ball coughlin reduced barbers fumbles to only one in the  season barber also saw his production increase significantly setting career highs in rushing and total yards each year under coughlin coughlins early move to manning though would pay dividends in  as manning and the giants went – in coughlins second season and won the nfc east for the first time since  it was also the giants first postseason appearance since making it as a wild card in  however a very poor performance by manning and a defense missing three starting linebackers saw the giants get shut out – at the hands of the carolina panthers at giants stadium following the game tiki barber called out coughlin and his offensive coordinator partially because a panthers player said that we knew what they were going to do before they did it coughlin and barber have yet to reconcile their differences with coughlin even refusing an interview by tiki then a sideline reporter for nbc which would have been held prior to a panthers–giants game in  new york giants gm jerry reese defensive coordinator steve spagnuolo offensive coordinator kevin gilbride  coughlin at giants stadium heading into the  season expectations for the giants were high in just over two years as the giants head coach coughlin transformed the giants from an underachieving last place team into a possible super bowl contender the giants struggled early during the  campaign going – in their first three games after a particularly bad loss to the seattle seahawks star tight end jeremy shockey stated that the giants had been outplayed and outcoached the giants rebounded by winning their next five games to go – however the giants suffered a stunning second half collapse losing  of their next  games to fall to – heading into the last game of the season after a late november loss to the jacksonville jaguars coughlin and his coaching staff were once again criticized by tiki barber barber also announced he was going to retire following the season which provided another distraction for the sliding giants things took another turn for the worse the next week when the giants blew a point fourth quarter lead and lost to the tennessee titans by a score of – after the game coughlin had said to the media im going to be sick about this one forever numerous injuries excessive penalties and a high number of turnovers were most responsible for the downward spiral of the  giants the media hounded coughlin with questions about barbers announcement and whether differences between coughlin and barber led to this point and the teams fans and ownership were starting to get restless about the coachs performance during a – loss to the new orleans saints late in the year a loud fire coughlin chant erupted at giants stadium the giants rebounded with a victory in the seasons final game at the washington redskins thereby securing a playoff berth and perhaps saving coughlins job in the process however coughlin and the giants lost to the philadelphia eagles – in the first round of the playoffs on january   it was announced that coughlin would receive a oneyear extension on his current contract through the  season but since the giants team policy is to never have a coach in the final year of his contract this only guaranteed that coughlin would remain as the giants head coach in  on february   tiki barber officially followed through on his threat to retire from the giants he cited numerous complaints about eli mannings leadership skills and coughlins practice style as decisions to retire at what seemed the peak of his career super bowl run and success –edit coughlin with president bush on april   in the  season the giants again started poorly with an – record however the team rebounded and won  straight games the team compiled a  road record for the season and they made it to the playoffs for the third year in a row coughlin and the giants had their first playoff win in seven years when his team defeated the tampa bay buccaneers on january   – the giants immediately followed up their win against tampa bay by narrowly defeating the dallas cowboys in the divisional playoffs winning – preventing dallas from beating them for the third time in the season the upset victory over the cowboys was followed up by a – overtime victory against the green bay packers in the nfc championship game this victory set up coughlins first appearance in a super bowl as a head coach super bowl xlii took place in glendale arizona on february   the game pitted coughlins new york giants – against the undefeated new england patriots – coached by bill belichick the patriots were favored by  points the underdog giants beat the patriots – in one of the biggest upsets in nfl history the upset would give coughlin his first super bowl ring as a head coach prior to the start of giants minicamp in may  coughlin and the giants were invited by president bush to the white house to honor their victory in super bowl xlii the super bowl win got coughlin a fouryear contract worth roughly  million to coach the giants through  the deal made him one of the nfls highestpaid coaches fresh off their super bowl season the team started off red hot going – through  games but after the plaxico burress shooting incident the team went – down the stretch and despite being the  seed they were eliminated in the divisional round of the playoffs by the philadelphia eagles the giants finished – in  despite solid offensive play however their defense struggled throughout the season and they missed the playoffs in  they began – and then began a fivegame winning streak to finish – at the bye the giants headed into week  against the eagles with a record of – in the final seconds the giants were faced with a fourth down and coughlin told his punter matt dodge to punt the ball out of bounds to effectively end the game however he punted the ball right to desean jackson who took it the distance and won the eagles the game in the miracle at the new meadowlands the loss jeopardized the giants playoff bid and once again coughlins future was uncertain however on july   he signed a oneyear contract extension to remain with the giants through the end of the  season second super bowl run edit following a very hectic free agency period when the giants lost pro bowl wide receiver steve smith defensive tackle barry cofield and tight end kevin boss expectations from many analysts and fans alike were very lowcitation needed after losing the season opener to the washington redskins in which the giants seemed worn out and tiredaccording to whom the giants went – before hitting a collapse losing four straight games at – the giants won three of their last four games to finish at – with the nfc east championship in their first playoff game since the  nfc divisional round they defeated the atlanta falcons – with the falcons only points coming on a first quarter safety on eli manning in the  divisional game coughlin coached the giants to a – win over the heavily favored defending super bowl champion green bay packers a team who finished the  regular season with a league best – wonloss record the following week he coached the giants to a – overtime victory over the san francisco ers in the nfc championship game to set up a super bowl rematch with the new england patriots on february   coughlins giants defeated the patriots – in super bowl xlvi thus making coughlin the oldest head coach to win a super bowl on june   it was announced he had signed a contract extension to keep him with the giants until at least  at the same time coughlin announced that he would like to coach into his seventies aftermath and playoff drought –edit unfortunately for coughlin the giants failed to make the playoffs in the  season despite starting the season – and finishing once again at – this was due in large part to two lopsided losses to the nfcs number one seed atlanta falcons and super bowl champion baltimore ravens in weeks  and  respectively worse still the giants began the  season – for the first time since  john mara the giants coowner stated that coughlins time with the giants could be limited despite the difficult start the team remained resilient and rebounded with wins against the vikings and eagles hitting the bye week at – victories against the raiders and packers coupled with a floundering nfc east left the giants only one and half games behind the divisionleading eagles going into week  this resurgence was brought to an abrupt halt with a – loss against the division rival cowboys the giants eventually finished the  season with a record of – coughlins only sub  record as head coach since his first season and quarterback eli mannings rookie season in  on february   coughlin told reporters at the  nfl combine that he agreed on a oneyear extension to his contract this move allowed him to remain the giants head coach throughout the  season on march   the

giants lost  out of their  losses by less than one touchdown with the final points being scored against them in the last  minutes criticism of coughlin built throughout the season and peaked in week  after a – loss to the carolina panthers in which coughlin left star receiver odell beckham jr in the game despite the latters onfield behavior resulting in a slew of personal foul penalties on january   coughlin resigned from his position as head coach for the giants in a statement released by the giants that day coughlin wrote i met with john mara and steve tisch this afternoon and i informed them that it is in the best interest of the organization that i step down as head coach i strongly believe the time is right for me and my family and as i said the giants organization the giants finished
