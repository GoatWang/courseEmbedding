macro element npk fertilization use flourish nitrogen™ flourish phosphorus™ or flourish potassium™ as needed flourish® is safe for invertebrates such as shrimp flourish® is designed to be used in

whereas the original bottle i purchased contained a much darker liquid which one of these two colors should flourish be and is there anything goodbad for the aquarium as a result of the color of the flourish a it is normal for the color of flourish to vary from batch to batch as this is dependent on the temperature that this product was blended at this is of no consequence to the function of the product q is the guaranteed analysis on flourish per dose a per dose per bottle per whatever unit of weight you choose it is expressed as percentage by weight not in absolute weights q can i use flourish on my garden vegetables a our products are strictly intended for aquarium use and have not been tested on anything intended for human consumption q i have a question about why you have phosphates in your flourish this is the  culprit in algae in aquaria a i believe if you check the amount of phosphorous content   youll see that at our recommended dosing this would only add  mgl ppm of phosphate to the water this is completely negligible and poses absolutely no risk of algae growth so unless you are planning on a  fold overdose you dont have to worry about ever getting any measurable phosphate from using flourish we dont sell flourish as a macro element supplement which is why the phosphorous nitrogen and potassium levels are as low as they are q i see that flourish contains copper is it safe to use with shrimp a yes flourish is safe to use with shrimp it is true that in large amounts copper can be toxic to aquatic animals and invertebrates like shrimp and snails can be particularly sensitive however copper is needed in trace amounts by both plants and animals including shrimp which is why we include it in flourish flourish trace and our other trace products the amount of copper in flourish is so small that you would have massively overdose before you would begin to approach an amount of copper that is toxic to even the most sensitive animals there is usually much more copper in tap water than there is in flourish q does flourish affect ph a used as directed flourish will not alter ph cant find what youre looking for ask us a new question your name
