 lend academy lend academyteaching the world about peer to peer lending groundfloor is breaking new ground with the world’s first regulation a deal making real estate crowdfunded loans available to retail investors for the first timeseptember   by ryan lichtenwald  comments i have been following groundfloor a real estate crowdfunding company for a couple of years now and what was most interesting to me was that they have always focused on the retail investor  previously investing was only available under a special exemption in georgia but it was clear that they wanted to open access to everyone to invest in real estate crowdfunding and this week they made it official i had a chance to catch up with brian dally cofounder and ceo to learn more about this announcement and his company going through sec registration is an expensive and onerous process due to the immense interest from institutional capital both new marketplace lenders and real estate crowdfunding platforms haven’t had to seek retail capital which has left investors like me with just two options lending club and prosper it is nice to see another company focus on the retail investor when i asked brian about the focus on retail capital he said that they believe that the performance of a capital market is really dependent on the source of capital in the market they set out to build the largest breadth of product that would end up creating the fastest cheapest and best source of capital groundfloor was purposely built to serve retail investors brian also noted that they had several opportunities to partner with institutional money but turned them all down at this stage they want to focus on the retail investor where no one else is focused not only are they the first real estate crowdfunding to achieve sec qualification but they have approached this in a completely different way to lending club and prosper they are doing an amended tier  regulation a offering often referred to as regulation a the process groundfloor took is not the same as the one lending club and prosper took which was through an s filing the advantage of the s is the ability to sell an unlimited amount of securities but that comes at a very high legal and regulatory cost the advantage of a tier  regulation a offering is a lower cost lower reporting requirement method to reach nonaccredited investors but it is limited to an offering of up to  million  groundfloor is groundbreaking  they are the first company that we are aware of to utilize regulation a since it became operable through the jobs act on june   to date they have originated over  million on their platform across  projects loans are fractionalized with the minimum investment being just  with this announcement lending will open up in california illinois maryland massachusetts texas virginia washington georgia and the district of columbia groundfloor uses a similar note structure to lending club and prosper called a borrower payment dependent note however their loans are much shorter and they are secured by real estate a typical loan through groundfloor is six months to one year in length with a loan amount of  to  per loan loans are typically made to developers for fix and flips projects for single family residential projects  since these are relatively short loans the end result is usually a sale of the home borrowers are charged an origination fee of  and servicing fees of  upon repayment while investors do not pay any fees they are subject to formation costs for the offering that can range from   average annualized yields for the investment is over   when it comes to expansion brian mentioned that they are working on other states but there is a regulatory burden of both compliance and disclosure they set out to find the states that had the most exciting real estate markets and where they felt there was a big enough base there were several other factors including size nature of the real estate market and state laws just like lending club and prosper they have to comply with state and federal laws the states chosen were ones they felt they could collaborate successfully with brian had several interesting things to say about their growth since they were in a pilot they didn’t emphasize growth and instead focused on the quality of the lending volume however that is not to say they haven’t been lending more when they first started they did  or  projects per month and late last year this increased to between  and  this pilot was deliberate so they could go through a full cycle now they have had k repaid on the platform in november they introduced groundfloor  which lowered the minimum investment from  to  they introduced a grading algorithm and added other features as well while some real estate crowdfunding companies have been focused on growth groundfloor has focused on product development they want to understand the consumer and build the right experience before they scale investing in real estate crowdfunding is something that has been previously offlimits to retail investors and it is great to see that retail investors will now have direct access as the company continues to grow it will become easier to invest in hundreds of properties more importantly it will be easy to be diversified with a relatively small investment it will be interesting to see if any other real estate crowdfunding sites follow suit if you’re interested in learning more about groundfloor you can view their company demo from lendit usa  here is the groundfloor press release comments fred says september   at  pm thank you for introducing us to these folks they’re a startup who publishes no information at all about their financial condition i found no financial information of any kind on their web site not the tiniest bit did i miss something before i send money i need some clue that they’re a suitable organization need to believe there’s a chance they will still be around for awhile after i buy notes from them how do i get that belief in the early days of prosper and lending club both listed the vcs who funded them at least that told us they had some serious backing every other pp guy at least does that later they filed detailed financial data with sec reply nick says february   at  pm my wife and i tried this our first  loan matured december th  it is now february th  and we still haven’t received our return supposedly he’s paying up on the th this month but honestly i doubt it not a sound investment compared to other proved methods sure there’s risk in investing however… from lro agreement found on website “company may negotiate to extend payment dates and could agree to a modified payment plan that could result in the lro holder receiving less than the expected return at the extended payment date” reply fred says september   at  pm perhaps they display some financial info to those who have been invited reply brian dally says september   at  pm fred thanks for your interest we agree it is important that an issuer such as groundfloor lendingclub and prosper publish full financial data and other background for the time being we are purposefully in a limited release period following qualification of our offering by the sec we realize that the publicly available part of our website does not contain all of the information one might require to consider investing with us as you posit in your followup comment our website does make additional information available to those who have been invited to participate in lending during our limited release anyone who is a regular reader of this blog and would like to participate during the limited release please email me at brian at groundfloor dot us we would be pleased to invite you and hear your feedback our sec filings contain full details about the company and our offering they are freely available to the public via edgar at this link httpusagoviqtlv brian dally cofounder  ceo groundfloor finance inc reply fred says september   at  pm there is a registration wall you have to create an account and a beta test wall you have to be invited but with a little email exchange with the groundfloor folks i got thru both and now have access to all the documents now that i have access the documents look very thorough it turns out that the same material is available on sec edgar as well although it is not easy to access there i eventually found it to get the offering memorandum you click on the most recent form aa and then click on “part ii” if i had understood that the stuff was all on edgar i wouldn’t have bothered the groundfloor guys but this reg a stuff is all new to me so nothing about it was obvious these fellows have done a lot of work and look to be set up in a more organized and thoughtful fashion than the other real estate pp guys at this point i’m impressed reply tony gutierrez says september   at  pm i’ve been investing with them for a while here in ga and have only positive reviews of the platform and the team reply matt says april   at  am does anyone know of a similar model that pays the interest to lenders ons monthly basis… groundfloor only pays at the end of the note thx reply mike m says april   at  am hi peter could you do a follow up on this company i’ve tried getting more performance data from their site but it looks like a lot of their loan details links are broken also it looks like the majority of the paid off loans are paid off long before their term reply ryan lichtenwald says april   at  am hi mike it may be some time before we get around to this i’d suggest reaching out directly or seeing if anyone on the lend academy forum has any firsthand experience with them reply tony gutierrez says april   at  am i can tell you about my experience as a long time user their website does sometime suffer from glitches but i chalk this up to their small core team size during their initial trial entrance to the business they just secured mil series a so i would expect a more refined website in the future a lot of loans do repay before the full term but its easy enough to reinvest in another and keep the annual interest earnings up the loans sell out rather quickly lately as interest has increased reply joseph says april   at  pm took a look at their site and i feel it is missing some really important data there is no data on their loan performance how many are paid off late or early how do they determine credit worthiness of individuals or businesses reply tony says april   at  am so far all have been paid back no defaults i agree there could be more data about when they are paid i know there is a lot of info on the site about their loan grading system but not sure about credit worthiness of the borrowers themselves no matter how you cut it its more secured than something like lending club reply brian dally says april   at  pm joseph thanks for spending time to have a look at groundfloor we’re still the only issuer qualified by the sec for nonaccredited investors to participate in directpp real estate lending everything you’re seeking and much more is therefore available in our public filings we are developing systems to allow for more efficient and easy to use disclosure via our website for the data you’re seeking for now we have to point you to the filings our public filings are available here for ease of reference also via the sec’s edgar database httpswwwgroundfloorusamendments loan performance data is disclosed in our supplemental filings the most recent of which is supplement no

individual investors it can nail down over  returns for you get started for house flippers  real estate developers nail down a hard money loan with rates as low as  get my rate what the press has to say about groundfloor closing the gap between the real estate investor and borrower through crowdfunding is what makes groundfloor innovative groundfloor is unusual in that its mission opens real estate investing to the general population…the investment is secured by the real property and there’s an aggressive prescreening process for developers groundfloor’s investors are regular americans who partner with developers on  to  real estate projects over a six month period investing on average  per project they earn between a  percent and  percent return on their investment within six to  months… investors run the gamut from retirees to professionals who want to invest in real estate part time unlike several other real estate crowdfunding platforms that require a minimum investment of  groundfloor asks for a minimum investment of only  typical groundfloor loans which carry interest rates varying between  and  percent return  percent annually on a sixtomonth term… real estate crowdfunding opens up the potential for achieving high riskadjusted yields that have traditionally remained the province of a very narrow sliver of privileged people… while most funds allow only “accredited” investors – those with at least  million net worth after their principal residence – a few like groundfloor have modeled their business on more recent federal rules that allow nonaccredited investors to play groundfloor fills a void for real estate entrepreneursthey provide shortterm highyield returns backed by real estate to entrepreneurs who are often ignored by traditional lenders developers…have embraced the opportunity they see it as a viable way to quickly raise cash for a project it was a nightmare working with banks costanzo said it was bureaucratic and tedious costanzo then reached out to groundfloor… groundfloor allows developers homebuilders and remodelers like costanzo to crowdfund money from online investors across the us — similar to how startups raise funds on kickstarter to manufacture new products within a couple of weeks costanzo a former wealth manager raised  from  investors through groundfloor…they just make it happen costanzo

to invest  make money in the rebounding housing market without the largescale capital requirements time requirement and managerial overhead of being a direct real estate investor and developer groundfloor allows you to take part with a relatively low cost of entry further i like being able to understand how the funds will be spent and who will be spending them… the return is attractive and the investment terms are short enough to where you don’t have to be without the liquidity for too long adam ailionreal estate developer my first groundfloor project which had  equity was denied funding from a bank and a credit union since i owned the property for less than  months i couldn’t even get a home equity line with my  credit score thankfully groundfloor arrived the project funded relatively swiftly and the loan underwriting was timely and much smoother than what i’ve experienced at large banks loan servicing and postclosing support were also responsive and they were prompt to make payments on any construction draws alex hillreal estate investor groundfloor makes investing in real estate a simple process with a minimum investment size of  per project it is easy for me to
