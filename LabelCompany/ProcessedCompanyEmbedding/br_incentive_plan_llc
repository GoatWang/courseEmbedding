longterm incentive plans  examples of longterm incentive plans  sales  sales incentive structure  incentive plans  what are incentive plans managers are the employees tasked with helping your company to accomplish its strategic goals and objectives the incentive plans you use to motivate your management team will likely play a role in your businesss growth and success a wide variety of incentive plans exist to help managers stay focused and driven consider a combination of incentive plans that will create a rich compensation package to aid with retention and achievement payforperformance apqc a knowledge management organization has used research to determine that offering performancebased pay at all levels within an organization is a rewards and retention best practice the payforperformance model normally consists of a base rate of pay coupled with a variable rate of pay that is specifically tied to an individuals performance topperforming managers are usually quite receptive to this model because it establishes a clear link between individual performance and the achievement of company goals youll want to determine whether to focus on operating profit as a measurement or on nonfinancial indicators such as product quality employee development or customer satisfaction when determining how to award variable pay stock options as of  more than  different stock option plans were being used by companies across the united states stock options are no longer an incentive offered exclusively to a companys elite executives but one that multiple businesses now extended to managers and subordinates stock options are usually offered by an employer as an employee retention incentive the idea is for the stock options to increase in value over a period of time so that the employee can sell the stocks at a profit once the designated waiting period has expired this incentive can encourage managers to exceed performance goals with the expectation that this will positively impact the companys stock value gainsharing gainsharing incentive plans are designed to foster collaboration involvement and an enhanced corporate culture even though this is an incentive plan that all employees may benefit from your management team can play an instrumental role in fostering teamwork productivity gains and the sharing of ideas that lead to improved organizational performance gainsharing is not just focused on a companys bottom line but on achieving increased operational performance along with positive employee attitudes companies that adopt this type of incentive plan are usually as concerned with the business environment or culture as much as the revenue or strategic goals recognition organizations that are intensely focused on recognizing the achievements of frontline employees can sometimes forget to recognize the contributions that managers have on impacting performance midlevel managers may be especially overlooked because the work they perform may not be as visible to senior management like all other employees your management team should be rewarded both publicly and privately for performance that exceeds expectations

publications events cases  deals blogs search blank rome government relations llc   search news publications events cases  deals blogs tweet share email print pdf management compensation and incentive programs after bankruptcy reform june   bonnie glantz fatell  michael b schaedle the americas restructuring and insolvency guide  the basic model for us corporate bankruptcy is to leave the debtor in possession during a chapter  to achieve a successful reorganization or in some instances a successful liquidation senior management and officers – those most knowledgeable about the business – continue to oversee the company thereby ensuring continuity throughout the chapter  process however when a company is in financial difficulty and may need respite from its creditors there is a significant risk that key employees will jump ship and seek more reliable employment how does a company in distress retain its senior executives and key personnel when their personal futures are as uncertain as that of the company moreover it is widely recognized that distressed companies need to incentivize key employees properly to induce them to work with the company during the chapter  to maximize value and hopefully turn the company around the law of senior management retention and incentives before reform the impact of enron in the past incentivizing key employees and senior management to remain with the company in return for a staying bonus was routine in a chapter  key employee retention programs kerps were used to maximize employee buyin to a company’s turnaround and recovery and became commonplace in modern chapter  cases a kerp often required a debtor’s use of property of its estate ie money outside the ordinary course of its business and therefore also required bankruptcy court approval under section b of the us bankruptcy code in order to have a kerp approved by the bankruptcy court the debtor had to demonstrate that there was a “sound business reason” for the program and that it was fair and reasonable this sort of corporate decisionmaking is usually supported by “a presumption that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis in good faith and in the honest belief that the action was in the best interests of the company” brehm v eisner  a d   n  del  generally bankruptcy courts did not and do not want to micromanage the company’s use of its property outside the ordinary course of its business and therefore will defer to a debtor’s business judgment so long as there is a sound business purpose to justify the use in question before the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act the ‘bankruptcy reform act’ became effective in october  kerps complemented modified or even replaced severance programs annual incentive plans consulting deals pension plan modifications and bonus provisions in employment contracts for senior management including insiders kerps enhanced ordinary compensation and bonus levels to those identified as key employees – arguably so that they would accept aligning their professional futures and reputations with a distressed company that had a higherthanusual chance of failure not infrequently kerps were negotiated and proposed on the eve of the filing of a bankruptcy or promptly after the bankruptcy commenced the bonuses were promised to senior management to induce them to stay with the company with assurance that the company’s officers would promptly seek court approval of the program in reliance on the company’s promises most key employees would work through the chapter  anticipating a bonus for their loyalty prior to the enactment of the bankruptcy reform act organized labor and creditors often argued that kerps were unnecessary for senior management and officers and inequitable for a debtor’s total workforce given the sacrifices required of such workers in bankruptcy eg job losses and pension and wage concessions it could be argued that once the case is filed senior management owed the debtor and its creditors a fiduciary duty to attempt to reorganize successfully without the inducement of enhanced compensation many contended that it was senior management’s failures that caused the company to file chapter  and there was no justification for rewarding their actions nevertheless in the years running up to bankruptcy reform kerps became common in complex chapter  cases in the united states and were almost a market feature of executive compensation in a distressed context more often than not courts deferred to the debtor’s business judgment and the argument that without a retention plan employees would resign in droves putting the future of the company in grave peril and the recoveries to creditors at risk while some may have questioned the intent and merit of a bonus program that was proposed by the very insiders who would benefit personally from the program the courts upheld companies’ decisions unless there was evidence that it was “so manifestly unreasonable that it could not be based upon sound business judgment but only on bad faith or whim or caprice” in re aerovox  br  bankr d mass  then in the early part of this decade corporate executives in the highprofile cases worldcom and enron were found to have engaged in self dealing and criminal conduct decimating companies jobs and pensions – to the grave detriment of rankand file employees at the same time mainly because of the various renowned corruption cases involving corporate officers kerps were characterized fairly or unfairly as a license to enable senior managers to cash in on corporate and labor market disasters for which they bore substantial responsibility this perceived inequity caused congress to enact section c of the bankruptcy code which places significant restrictions on kerps the bankruptcy code now severely restricts the ability to make retention or severance payments to insiders the three subsections of section c of the bankruptcy code effectively prohibit retention programs for insiders in chapter  reorganizations outside a plan place limitations on severance payments to insiders and establish standards for benefits for noninsider employees provided that the transfers or obligations are outside the ordinary course of the company’s business and justified by the facts and circumstances of the case section c makes it almost impossible to create a kerp that directly pays stay or retention bonuses to insiders indeed there are no reported decisions approving any such kerp after october  eg see in re dana corp ‘dana i’  br   n  bankr sdny  in order to offer a retention bonus to an insider the requirements of section c must be met and applied strictly first the debtor has to show that an insider has a pending job offer that exceeds the insider’s existing compensation package inclusive of commissions benefits stock options and all wage equivalents or supplements it then has to prove that the company would fail without the insider’s continued employment finally no insider kerp can be approved unless nonmanagement employees have benefited from a kerp in the same year or unless the debtor has in place a kerp that benefited the insider in question in the previous calendar year if the first two hurdles are overcome the court must then apply a formulaic and conservative approach to ensure that the benefits for insiders are not substantially in excess of those provided to nonmanagerial employees in effect as a threshold matter an insider must have in hand a better paid job offer presumably with a financially sound company if that is the case why would the insider choose the uncertainty of staying with a chapter  debtor that may or may not reorganize for a stay bonus that is subject to a formulaic cap and is likely to be less valuable than incentives available to the executive prepetition the company then has to demonstrate that the insider’s exit will cause the company to fail – that is that the insider is irreplaceable this is an impossible burden for any company that uses professional managers for which a relevant labor market exists these provisions of the bankruptcy reform act accomplish section c’s intended objective effectively precluding any debtor from making retention benefits available to insiders in a chapter  case in addition section c of the bankruptcy code appears to prohibit severance payments to insiders unless the severance is part of an overall program applicable to the general workforce and the various plans relating to severance covering that workforce in that case the severance payments to insiders are capped at  times the amount actually paid to nonmanagement employees in a given calendar year section c of the bankruptcy code is a catchall clause intended to cover plans and programs that are outside the ordinary course of a debtor’s business and are not formally designed to retain insiders while the section primarily seems to restate the old “sound business judgment” standard dana i supra at  in re nobex corporation case no  mfw nt at  bankr d del jan   it has been suggested that under section c all compensation programs that can have a retentive effect with respect to insiders are subject to stricter scrutiny under section c than the prebankruptcy reform act sound business judgment test in re cep holdings llc slip op  lexis  at  bankr nd ohio nov   overall section c of the bankruptcy code makes it much more difficult for a debtor to provide key employees with retention and performance incentives indeed the only programs characterized as kerps for insiders since the bankruptcy reform act came into force have been some modest section c severance programs in middlemarket debtor cases in those instances the disparity between historical severance payments to insiders and the general workforce are not so excessive as to prohibit meeting the formula set out in section c eg see in re flyi inc case no  mfw nt at  bankr d del jan   incentive plans versus retention plans fact sensitive distinctions due to the undoubted importance to a distressed company of incentivizing key employees to remain with the company and maximizing enterprise value or accomplishing a successful turnaround debtors have been very creative in structuring programs that fall within the ambit of section c the most common approach to tackling the business problem posed to debtors by section c is to develop post petition compensation programs that offer insiders and other key employees incentives to create value or to continue prepetition programs that incentivize insiders and other senior managers the basic concept is to require the creation of value for the estate as a condition to payment of compensation enhancements milestones have to be identified including for example increased asset sale prices or enterprise value increased cash and operating sales levels coupled with expense reductions or successful negotiation and compromise of certain controversies it has been argued that the existence of incentive programs creates an environment that is retentive in nature nevertheless courts have consistently found that the prohibitions in section c are inapplicable to true incentive programs irrespective of the retentive effect of such programs dana i  br at  – “i do not find that incentivizing plans which may have some components that arguably have a retentive effect necessarily violate section c’s requirements” also see in re calpine corporation case no  brl nt at  bankr sdny apr   – incentives only paid where enterprise value increases and thus are not retention bonuses but are performance based the following are examples of incentive plans that have been approved by bankruptcy courts since the bankruptcy reform act irrespective of retentive effects and insider eligibility to participate in bonuses as a result of a negotiation between the debtor and the creditors’ committee to resolve the committee’s objection to the debtor’s incentive program as originally proposed the debtor compromised and agreed to pay its chief executive officer and vice president for finance and administration a percentage of sale proceeds realized but only if the sale proceeds exceeded a floor established by an already negotiated stalking horse bid for the debtor’s assets nobex slip op  bankr lexis  at  bankr d del jan   senior executives were permitted to receive a longterm incentive bonus if the debtor reached specific earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda levels up to an annual cap the plan covered three years and was payable in a mix of currencies including company stock over the term of the plan in re dana corporation ‘dana ii’  br    bankr sdny  senior management and other tiers of key employee received bonuses equal to a sliding percentage of their base compensation if the debtor achieved certain levels of ebitda for certain periods in re nellson neutraceutical inc  br   bankr d del  senior management was eligible to receive a rate able share of all or of  per cent of a quarterly bonus pool depending on the achievement on a quarter by quarter basis of ebitda levels and certain other cashflow benchmarks further senior sales managers can receive bonuses based on percentages of base compensation if sales goals are met in a given quarter in re global home products llc  br   bankr d del  in the american home mortgage case the delaware bankruptcy court approved a plan offering critical employees including an insider familiar with the debtor’s construction and mortgage loan business incentive bonuses to negotiate and compromise certain loans successfully the plan was properly characterized as a salerelated incentive plan and not a retention or severance plan for insiders accordingly it was not governed by sections c or c since the stay or retention bonus provisions applied only to non insiders it was authorized under the catchall section c as it was justified by a sound business purpose however the courts have refused to approve artificially low target completion bonuses and noncompete compensation for a chief executive officer as being effective retention bonuses prohibited by section c see dana i  br at  ordinary course benefit and performance plans some debtors have argued that longstanding bonus or pension plans are ordinary course business programs that are excluded from the ambit of section c because the goal and purpose of the plan is not the retention of insiders further debtors have caused pension plans to be modified and assumed in ways that are favorable to senior management claiming that the modifications are ordinary course and not in the nature of severance and were neither conceived nor modified for a primarily retentive purpose these approaches have met with some success the delaware court in nellson nutraceutical found that a longstanding bonus program based on driving ebitda was in the ordinary course of the debtor’s business although the program which was actually modified post petition to lower ebitda triggers to ensure payment of some bonus pool was available to senior management the court found that the program was not designed to retain senior management in bankruptcy but rather was designed consistent with industry standards and the reasonable expectations of the debtor’s stakeholders regarding the debtor’s ordinary conduct of its business to drive debtor cash flow in this context the court found both sections c and  inapplicable and the program as modified was supported by the debtor’s goodfaith reasonable business judgment nellson nutraceutical  br at   in global home products the court held that a sales performance incentive program was an ordinary course business mechanism designed to incentivize performance in or out of bankruptcy and therefore was not subject to the limits of section c global home products  br at  similarly the court in dana ii  br at  found that an annual incentive program was ordinary course and nonretentive even though it had been modified just prior to bankruptcy the court said that the program had “been a common component of compensation plans at dana for the past fifty years and did not differ significantly from dana’s prepetition practice” id the dana ii court also held that the assumption of pension plans for senior management upon emergence from bankruptcy was not governed by section c focusing on the facts that the senior employees had already vested pension benefits under relevant plans in part and that the pension plan assumption was tied to the company’s exit from bankruptcy and not to the employees’ retention by the firm the court found that the purpose behind the pension assumption was not retentive in nature and that the pension modifications were customary and ordinary plan adjustments and not in the nature of severance dana ii  br at  other key issues relating to management incentives insider status and source and effect of retentive benefits the threshold question in evaluating an employee compensation enhancement program is how to define an ‘insider’ courts have been fairly conservative in finding insider status see cep holdings slip op  lexis  at  – insider status indicated where control is not indicated by title but by organizational authority in re refco inc case no  rdd order approving implementation of key employee compensation program at  bankr sdny jan   – focusing on level of control exercised by senior employees in a liquidation and determining that in light of the course of the liquidation and its requirements such employees were no longer insiders and the compensation program could be evaluated under a business judgment test other courts have addressed whether the title of an employee is enough to deem him or her an insider for example many companies freely designate employees as vice presidents in a recent case the court required an evidentiary hearing to determine if the title of vice president connoted control and decisionmaking authority or whether the employee was properly included in a stay bonus plan as a noninsider in limited situations insiders have received retention bonuses since the enactment of the bankruptcy reform act some courts have approved contracting with former officers and insiders as consultants in capacities where those officers are providing strategic leadership and related services in exchange for a fee – even over objections that such consulting arrangements effectively deliver an insider a retention bonus see in re lg philips display usa inc case no  bls nt at  bankr d del apr   – the court suggested without holding that agreement to provide consulting services for fee is not akin to agreement to be employed and to be paid a retention bonus other courts have refused to upset prepetition kerp planning where the bonuses are paid by a third party and where that third party is not seeking reimbursement from the estate in in re airway indus inc  br  bankr wd pa  the court approved retention bonuses for senior management that had been negotiated with the debtor’s senior secured creditor prepetition as part of the terms of a sale under section  of the bankruptcy code the court permitted the retention bonuses to be paid because the secured creditor and not the estate was the source of the payment and importantly the bonuses were not added to the secured creditor’s claim thereby depleting estate recoveries final notes section c of the bankruptcy code attempts to restrict severely transfers or obligations that have the effect of paying insiders merely to stay with distressed companies it has largely succeeded in ending retention bonuses for insiders and other key employees but the law has evolved sensibly in reaction to this prohibition retentive programs can be approved that benefit senior management however debtors must diligently ensure that such bonus programs are equitably structured to benefit nonmanagement workers as well as officers and managers debtors must act to ensure that retentive incentive programs are costeffective derive from historical practice are consistent with industry standards and drive business performance or strategic success postbankruptcy reform act incentive and bonus programs for key employees must also be structured carefully and professionally so as not to deplete estate resources finally debtors must be transparent regarding such programs with key stakeholders eg official and ad hoc committees lenders key executory contract counter parties to build support and consensus for these plansthis chapter has been

incentive units in a limited liability corporation draft this draft should not be relied upon for academic scientific legal or other uses this draft consists of unvetted unverified statements that could change at any time home page issue when a company is incorporated as a limited liability corporation llc the company gives some employees incentive units which vest when certain conditions are met eg employment period exceeds three years the employee has the right to purchase these units which are voting equity units at a strike price which is stated in advance this summary assumes that the unit�s strike price is higher than the fair value at the time the unit is vested authoritative literature after searching both published and unpublished literature and inquiring with various technical publications we found no technical literature that addresses incentive units in llcs or partnerships inquiry with the american institute of certified public accounts showed that there is no authoritative literature in effect some accountants have treated such equity instrument in the same manner of stock options as mandated by apb  and fas  financial account board�s financial accounting statement no  fas  accounting for stockbased compensation superceded apb opinion no  account for stock issued to employees the main effect of fas  over apb  is that under the preferred fas  fair value is measured by a stockoption value method and not by the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb  according to fas  it applies to all transactions in which an entity grants shares of its common stock stock options or other equity instruments to its employees except for equity instruments held by an employee stock ownership plan this application is in connection to providing goods and services by either employees or suppliers par  stock options and incentive units llc�s incentive units appear in substance to be similar to stock options they have a predetermined vesting conditions and periods predetermined price and similar business reasons of granting ie compensating employees without cash outflow internal revenue code irc section  governs the application of incentive stock options some differences are present however deductibility of stock options by employers incentive stock options trigger ordinary income to the employer equal to the proceeds received from the employees these options are also not subject to erisa but a report of incentive stock options exercised is required as supplementary to the w report to employees incentive units in an llc are under fas  allocated over the vesting period as compensation costs or payment to service provider if given to nonemployees who may be given incentive units incentive stock options are options given to employees to purchase stock at favorable conditions with little risk of loosing if the stock underperforms when the option is vested they are granted only to employees who own less than  of the voting power in the employer�s stock incentive units if viewed as stock options do not have such restrictions and can be granted to non employees eg suppliers incentive units granting disregards the current ownership level of the recipient limitation on incentive units incentive stock options are limited in their vesting schedule for  per year for tax purposes incentive units treated like stock options do not carry such limitation accounting treatment of stock options both apb  and fas  are acceptable treatment although fas  is preferred however if apb  is adopted proforma income statement should be disclosed to the results under the fairvalue method prescribed in fas  par  under apb  companies recognize compensation expense stemming from employee stock option based on the difference between the strike price typically lower and the fair value of the stock on day of grant that difference in the proceeds from employee�s stock option is attributed to compensation and is recognized as compensation expense under apb  for example on january   an employee is granted a strike price of  the employee exercises their strike price on january   the employee stock option vests on december   on december   the stock�s value is  on the open market on december   the company grants the employee the stock � which is now vested and recognizes compensation expense of  per share under fas  the excess of the projected estimated fair value par  of the stock option upon vesting over the strike price is allocated over the service period par  the service period starts at the date of exercise and ends at the date of vesting the projected price of non public companies may result in a minimum value for the stock option because market price volatility is unknown for example an employee exercises a stock option on january   at a strike price of  per share and the stock option vests in three years on december   on january   the stock option fair value using a projection model is estimated to be  per share the company will recognize a     years   per year of compensation expense on december   the employee�s option is vested and the company grants the employee a stock while the employee�s option is not vested the company also reclassifies the unissued stock as restricted generally the projected fair price in the example above  is the value upon restriction some employee stock option plans esop does not qualify as stock options that trigger compensation expense recognition generally when employees can purchase the stock at a small discount deminimus and when substantially all full time employees qualify the excess of the fair value of the stock over the strike price is not compensation expense to the company other issues repurchase agreement a mandatory repurchase agreement does not change the accounting treatment of stockoptions par  dividends generally additional compensation for dividends on unvested stock options or stock options that allow the employee to keep such dividends is charged as compensation expense in the period of payment tax effects generally prepaid compensation expenses are not tax deductible the time value of the compensation which is built in the projected estimated value upon the option�s vesting is also not tax deductible therefore a temporary difference resulting in a deferred tax asset is accounted for based on the accumulated applicable compensation costs and reduced by a valuation allowance par  once vested and granted the actual compensation cost in excess of the accumulated compensation cost that was used for the deferred tax asset should be recognized as additional paid in capital and not as deferred tax asset par  however if the actual compensation cost is below the compensation cost that was used for the deferred tax asset the write off should first be taken from additional paid in capital that is attributed to any prior excess and then as an expense on the income statement par  summary incentive units are more similar in substance to stock options than to incentive stock options although no direct authoritative literature exist to mandate the accounting treatment of an llc�s incentive units fas  require the fair value method to be applied to the stock options upon exercising them by the employee or service provider the excess of the projected fair value of the option over the strike price should be allocated over the vesting period when the stock vests the difference between the accumulated allocation and the actual fair value of the option is charged to apic if the vesting and excersising occurs simulataniously the charge is to the period of exercised and the difference if to apic for excess or as a loss to the income statement  yigal rechtman draft  � required disclosure
