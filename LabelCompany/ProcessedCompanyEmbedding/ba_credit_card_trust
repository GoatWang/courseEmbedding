america national association �bana� issues credit cards on mastercard�s and visa�s networks� mastercard and visa are subject to settlement obligations relating to certain litigations and continue to be subject to significant ongoing litigations including class actions and increased competition� these settlements and litigations are based on among other things claimed violations of united states federal antitrust laws claims that currency conversion fees were wrongly applied on purchases of goods and services in foreign countries and claims alleging that the interchange charged by mastercard and visa is impermissible� the costs associated with these settlements litigations and other matters could cause mastercard and visa to invest less in their networks and marketing efforts and could adversely affect the interchange paid to their member banks including bana �  litigation in  a group of merchants filed a series of putative class actions and individual actions directed at interchange fees associated with visa and mastercard payment card transactions� these actions which were consolidated in the us district court for the eastern district of new york under the caption in re payment card interchange fee and merchant discount antitrust litigation �interchange� named visa mastercard and several banks and bank holding companies including bank of america corporation as defendants� plaintiffs alleged that defendants conspired to fix the level of default interchange rates and that certain rules of visa and mastercard related to merchant acceptance of payment cards at the point of sale were unreasonable restraints of trade under the sherman act plaintiffs sought unspecified damages and injunctive relief on october   defendants including bank of america corporation �bac� settled the matter the settlement provides for among other things i payments by defendants to the class and individual plaintiffs totaling approximately  billion allocated proportionately to each defendant based upon losssharing agreements ii distribution to class merchants of an amount equal to  basis points of default interchange across all visa and mastercard credit card transactions for a period of eight consecutive months which period began on july   which otherwise would have been paid to visa and mastercard issuers including bac and which effectively reduces credit interchange for that period of time and iii modifications to certain visa and mastercard rules regarding merchant point of sale practices the court granted final approval of the class settlement agreement on december   several class members have appealed to the us court of appeals for the second circuit in addition a number of the class members opted out of the settlement of their past damages claims the cash portion of the settlement was adjusted downward as a result of these optouts bac was named as a defendant in two of the optout suits brought by merchant class members as a result of various sharing agreements from the main interchange litigation bac remains liable for any settlement or judgment in optout suits where it is not named as a defendant all but one of the optout suits filed to date have been consolidated in the us district court for the eastern district of new york in addition in december  a putative class action was filed by cardholders in the us district court for the northern district of california alleging claims under the sherman act and under california state law in june  the cardholder action was transferred to the eastern district of new york and consolidated with the optout suits on july   the court denied defendants� motion to dismiss the complaints filed by the merchant class members who opted out of the settlement and one of the two suits brought by the merchant class members has since been settled on november   the court granted defendants� motion to dismiss the sherman act claim brought by the cardholder plaintiffs but denied the motion as to the state law claims the parties have moved for reconsideration of this decision and have also appealed to the us court of appeals for the second circuit regulatory developments on april   fia card

participant or ii any material deficiency in such servicing participant�s policies and procedures to monitor vendor compliance exceptions bank of america national association� bana�s report on assessment and the related attestation report prepared by pricewaterhousecoopers llp have identified material noncompliance with one servicing criterion applicable to bana � servicing criterion dv which contemplates that bana�s records regarding the pool assets agree with its records with respect to an obligor�s unpaid principal balance prior to february   bana utilized two payment prioritization methodologies when servicing credit card accounts� the cardholder cycle payment methodology was utilized for customer calculations such as balance subject to finance charge finance charges billed and statement balance reporting functions� the daily trust payment methodology was utilized for reporting on the assets in the ba master credit card trust ii portfolio the two previously utilized methodologies agreed on the total outstanding balance and total payments received for each credit card account but they varied with respect to the component principal receivable and finance charge receivable balances� this variance was primarily due to differences in the prioritization applied to payments and credit adjustments under each of the two methodologies please refer to the endnotes to exhibit  in the registrant�s distribution report on form d filed with the sec on march   for a description of the two payment prioritization methodologies previously utilized by bana on february   bana implemented a systems initiative that consolidated these methodologies into a single payment prioritization methodology� this consolidated methodology prioritizes payments and credit adjustments to balances similar to the cardholder methodology but does so on a daily basis similar to the trust methodology �  platformlevel reports regulations of the sec require that each servicing participant complete a report on assessment at a �platform� level meaning that the transactions covered by the report on assessment should include all assetbacked securities transactions involving such servicing participant that are backed by the same asset type� subsequent guidance from the sec staff identifies additional parameters that a servicing participant may apply to define and further limit its platform� for example a servicing participant may define its platform to include only transactions that were completed on or after january   the effective date for regulation ab and that were registered with the sec pursuant to the securities act of � each servicing participant is responsible for defining its own platform and each platform will naturally differ based on various factors including the servicing participant�s business model the transactions in which it is involved and the range of activities performed in those transactions b other reports� bana has completed an assertion letter which states that as of june   its controls over the functions performed as servicer of ba master credit card trust ii and ba credit card trust are effective in providing

a level of losses commensurate with the risk associated to a rating level with the available credit enhancement the variables that fitch stresses are the gross yield mpr gross chargeoff and purchase rates the breakeven loss level output for the notes provides an indication of the remoteness of the class of notes to stressed performance deterioration for further information please review fitchs us credit card abs issuance updates published on a monthly basisthe affirmations are based on the performance of the trusts in line with expectations the stable outlook on the senior notes indicates that

own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterpartys creditworthiness as per the counterparty criteria for structured finance and covered bonds dated sept   the definition of eligible investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by fitch which represents a criteria variation since the only available funds to invest are monthly

ratings assignedeligible institution fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterpartys creditworthiness as per the counterparty criteria for structured finance and covered bonds dated sept   the definition of eligible institutions for this deal allows for the possibility of using a depository institution rated at a level which does not meet the fitch counterparty criteria for a aaasf rated note since bank of america national association bana as holder of the collection account currently maintains a afstable outlook rating and the bank of new york mellon as holder of the finance charge and principal accounts currently maintains a aafstable outlook rating fitch doesnt currently believe such a variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assignedrating sensitivitiesfitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card assetbacked securities transactions  increased defaults  a reduction in purchase rate and  a combination stress of higher defaults and lower mprread moreincreasing defaults alone has no impact on rating migration even in the most severe scenario of a  increase in defaults the rating sensitivity to a reduction in purchase rate also does not result in rating migration even in the most severe scenario of a  reduction in purchase rate the harshest scenario assumes both stresses to defaults and mpr to occur simultaneously the ratings would only be downgraded under the severe stress of a  increase in defaults and  reduction in mpr to date the transactions have exhibited strong performance with all performance metrics within fitchs initial expectations for further discussion of sensitivity analysis please see the new issue report
