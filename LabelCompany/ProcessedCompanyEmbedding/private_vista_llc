is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and

better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website expand your targeting

overhead but also as means for enriching lives then together we are able to provide deeper and broader resources for devising and implementing the strategies and plans to help you reach the vision of your life enriched—your private vista enjoy the view here are some answers faq what do you mean by wealth management evolved℠ wealth management traditionally focuses on managing financial issues based on client questions “how much money can i make and how much do i need” we base our wealth management services on our questions “what fulfills your life now and how do you envision your life in the future” our evolution is in the process through which our clients inventory prioritize and articulate their goals so that for the first time their financial decisions are motivated by their life direction not the other way around your private vista then is your view of the life you want to live and the financial decisions you’ll make to clear that path how do you help me inventory prioritize and articulate my life goals from all our years of asking questions about life aspirations passions talents and purpose we have mapped out an insightful journey of selfdiscovery for our clients in fact many of our clients think of this as sort of a personal life planning retreat we find our clients are often considering how they might enrich their current and future lives for the first time the result of this personal journey is a view of resources both financial and life and goals for how to invest them this is what we call a private vista and it informs the financial planning and wealth management process what is a registered investment advisory firm private vista is an registered investment advisory firm meaning that we’re registered with and regulated by the us securities and exchange commission sec we are deemed a fiduciary by law we also file an annual report to the sec and states where we operate the report includes our services our clients and how we’re compensated this report is available upon request or at the sec’s website what is a fiduciary a fiduciary advisor role is generally relationship driven with fees for compensation while a nonfiduciary advisor role is often transaction driven with commissions as compensation a fiduciary must act in utmost good faith and place clients’ best interests above all else private vista is an independent firm that holds itself to a fiduciary standard this distinguishes us from nonfiduciary advisors who might be employed by companies that sell financial products like a brokerage firm or insurance company how does private vista get compensated financial planning our planning is feebased because transparency is imperative we meet with clients initially at no cost to determine the right work scope and a commensurate fixed fee once clients agree to move forward most of them revisit their plan annually at a reduced planning fee investment management management fees are distinct from planning fees they are based on a fixed percentage of assets under management which declines as assets increase this fee is charged quarterly on the total assets private vista manages for a client a current fee schedule is available upon request what do the certification initials after a professional’s name really mean in general they mean that our professionals have put the time and study into learning theory and best practices for financial planning wealth management portfolio management retirement income and a host of other services we offer together they mean that we offer a comprehensive range of
