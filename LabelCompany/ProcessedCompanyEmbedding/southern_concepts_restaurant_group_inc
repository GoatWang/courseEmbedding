denver business journal southern concepts restaurant group inc is putting a renewed focus on its sitdown restaurant southern hospitality rather than just concentrating on its carve fastcasual barbecue concept hoping to rise out of the doldrums facing much of the restaurant industry now ceo jim fenlason took over his position with the colorado springsbased company otcqb ribs on aug  replacing former ceo mitchell roth he said company executives who have had mixed success at their four colorado restaurants are trying to streamline the organization and finetune their menus to increase revenue enlarge jim fenlason ceo of southern concepts restaurant group stands to the right of jeff… more kathleen lavine  denver business journal they have decided to pull back on previous plans to grow only carve and expand it quickly out of state replacing that idea with a goal to undertake “smart growth” in colorado and to add a third concept to the mix “we didn’t do anything wrong it’s just time to take that next step on our progression” said fenlason a restaurantindustry veteran who served on the board of the company before assuming daytoday oversight of it “i just don’t think we’ve taken full advantage of our brand” southern hospitality a sitdown barbecue joint launched nine years ago in new york with celebrity investors like justin timberlake behind it southern concepts bought the franchise rights for colorado and now operates locations in denver lone tree and colorado springs plus the fastcasual spinoff carve barbecue on colorado boulevard in denver — the only such restaurants outside of new york fenlason said that some of the four locations are profitable while others are not and he acknowledged that the concepts like most of the restaurant industry struggled this summer his first major action as ceo was to eliminate most of the corporate staff for the chain allowing him to work directly with restaurant general managers and bartenders that’s led to the rollout of new menu dishes in recent months ranging from chickenfried steak to smoked meatloaf to whiskey wiggle cake with bourbon butterscotch ice cream fenlason wants to open up one or two more locations of each concept along the front range in the coming years and he wants to add a third brand — a smaller eatery that serves a limited menu of memphisstyle barbecue sandwiches smoked in a central kitchen that would allow the company to take full advantage of rising commercial rent in the denver area he said only after about a fiveyear buildout will the company look at franchising or going out of state he said in that time he believes it can nail down its marketing to convince people that southern food doesn’t equal unhealthy food and promote unusual features such as its bourbon bar “in the right market with the right demographics there’s still a demand for our product” fenlason said “we’re not a sitdown hamburger restaurant  a good highquality southern restaurant is still hard to find” ed
