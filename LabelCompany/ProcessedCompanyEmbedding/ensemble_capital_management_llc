our independent objective research we manage portfolios on behalf of families trusts foundations nonprofits investment philosophy we use a commonsense approach to discovering intrinsically valuable companies we believe that investors are best served by owning a portfolio of companies both emerging and established that have significant growth opportunities and competitive advantages that allow them to sustain their profitability while returning capital to shareholders over time rather than trying to guess which way the market or certain stocks may move in reaction to shortterm news we look to participate in the profitability of companies that will achieve superior longterm corporate performance we are business analysts not stock market pundits we spend our time learning as much as possible about the industry trends competitive dynamics and customer demands that give rise to intrinsically valuable companies many investors on the other hand are nothing more than stock market speculators analyzing the stock market instead of the actual companies in which they invest while it is seductive to think that an investor can guess which way the market will turn sustainable returns are generated through investing capital based on extensive analysis of the specific businesses in which you take a position we believe the best approach to investing in the stock market is based on identifying strong businesses evaluating what these companies are worth and then buying the stock of these companies when they are priced at a discount to their intrinsic value the attraction of this approach is based on the timeless nature of its applicability while we bring our own take on the best way to evaluate investment opportunities and construct portfolios the core of our process is the same essential approach used by many of the truly great investors over the last century we think this will be the approach used by many of the truly great investors over the next century as well while various styles of investing come in and out of favor buying great companies at compelling prices based on the amount of cash earnings they can return to shareholders over time is a commonsense approach that has worked over the longterm it is an easy to understand but difficult to execute task and one on which we focus all of our time and energy we are business analysts not stock market speculators we spend our time learning as much as possible about the industry trends competitive dynamics and customer demands that give rise to intrinsically valuable companies we put our clients’ capital to work based on extensive analysis of the specific businesses in which we invest importantly we think that all investments that create cash flow have an intrinsic value that is distinct from the price set by the market investments like artwork gold and other commodities do not have this same type of intrinsic value they are instead worth exactly what people are willing to pay for them investments such as bonds or stocks which generate cash flows are valuable even if there is no market in which to sell them while market prices frequently are a good approximation of an investment’s intrinsic value the key to longterm performance is doing the deep research required to identify those instances in which market value deviates from intrinsic value identifying and exploiting these occasions of market mispricing is the focus of our investment management process case study ensemble can help manage your assets to counterbalance positions held elsewhere michael oversees a significant base of assets on behalf of his extended family he makes asset allocation and longterm planning decisions himself and places his family’s capital with various investment managers that demonstrate superior results within their area of focus michael hired ensemble capital to manage his allocation to us equities ensemble’s approach to equity management allows our clients to participate across the typical value vs growth categories and regardless of whether small medium or large capitalization stocks offer the best investment opportunities michael’s interest is in achieving the strongest possible longterm investment returns while minimizing risk ensemble capital’s approach of building a focused portfolio of superior companies trading at reasonable valuations was a good fit for michael’s longterm approach to investing unlike the large majority of separate account investment managers who offer only a small set of “model portfolios” ensemble built a custom portfolio for michael this meant that we were able to reduce his portfolio’s exposure to energy stocks to offset some significant energy holdings that michael’s family held elsewhere we also enabled michael to harvest significant capital gains in his portfolio with us to match against losses realized in another portfolio importantly working with ensemble for his us equity allocation meant that michael had direct access to the portfolio manager working on his account speaking with his various portfolio managers is an important aspect of how michael gathers the information he needs to set his overall asset allocation and make investment decisions in addition to providing quarterly statements and performance reports ensemble meets with michael regularly in person and by phone to discuss the portfolio and the general state of financial markets we also provide ondemand reporting to the accounting firm that handles michael’s complex financial holdings to protect the privacy of our clients case studies appearing on this website are fictionalized but represent typical client engagements stock selection ensemble performs deep original research to identify companies we believe will produce strong results with limited risk stock selection  how we pick stocks we carefully construct customized portfolios of these companies on behalf of each client original inhouse research is at the heart of our investment process we look for companies that have superior competitive positioning and create real cash earnings on behalf of shareholders at a higher than average rate these companies achieve aboveaverage returns on the capital they invest into their businesses while growing at sustainable and attractive levels return on invested capital ability to grow we understand that any potential investment is far more than a blip on a stock screen it’s a business and ultimately businesses exist to create value for their owners to this end we focus on finding attractive businesses that deliver real and sustainable shareholder value we believe return on invested capital roic – that is the realized cash return on each dollar invested in the business – is the key metric to determine the valuecreating ability of any company we focus on companies that generate high or improving roic as those businesses all else equal deliver the greatest shareholder value we look first for durable companies that we believe have bright prospects and limit our investments to those that pass our rigorous tests only after this assessment positively identifies an investment opportunity do we work to establish what we believe is a reasonable estimate of the company’s intrinsic value we then require the stocks we add to our portfolio to be trading at a substantial discount to our estimate of that intrinsic value we do extensive fundamental research to identify companies with these characteristics the attributes we look for include strong and durable competitive advantages high and sustainable returns on invested capital competent and shareholderoriented management longterm growth opportunities and sustainable levels of debt the focus of our investment process is in identifying the small number of companies that we believe have the ability to potentially produce a relatively predictable stream of cash flow generation it is these companies that we believe we have the capacity to make a reasonable estimate of their intrinsic value and therefore identify those times when the market price of their stock offers a compelling investment opportunity while we believe we can identify these relatively rare companies we also acknowledge that the large majority of companies have relatively unpredictable futures we believe that most investors including ourselves are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the intrinsic value of the large majority of publicly traded companies or of the stock market as a whole which of course is largely made up of these unpredictable companies our view on these other companies and on the market as a whole is not negative but simply agnostic rather than seeking to pass judgement on all investment opportunities we restrict our investments to those we think we can make an informed decision about and decline to hold an opinion about investments that do not pass this test stock selection  expectations matter even the most attractive business does not have unlimited value frequently the market will have excessively optimistic or pessimistic expectations about a company’s prospects which are often reflected in stock valuations our objective is to identify companies with outstanding profitability and growth characteristics at times when the market does not fully appreciate them we always seek to pay a compelling price for the businesses in which we invest a fundamental element of our research process is estimating what a potential investment is worth — that is its intrinsic value alongside our company due diligence we use several methods to derive that estimate we consider traditional valuation metrics but we also generate an informed estimate of the economic profits a company can deliver now and into the future we only invest client capital in companies which trade at a meaningful discount to our intrinsic value estimate taking great care not to assume that every great company is also a great investment opportunity portfolio management intelligence is knowing wisdom is knowing what to do portfolio management  how we manage portfolios the portfolio management process is a critical aspect of risk control we believe that there are two key elements of successful portfolio management that are not practiced by the majority of investors while it is possible to be successful without abiding by these guidelines not sticking with them makes superior performance much more difficult to achieve portfolio management  the true cost of diversification investment diversification has a sweet spot too much can be costly — and too little can be much worse over the years the financial services industry has broadly accepted and promoted the mistaken idea that more diversification is always better both academic and real world studies show that for a portfolio of stocks the risk reduction benefits of additional diversification is minimal beyond  to  positions in addition the cost of diversification beyond this point outweighs the potential benefits — adding a th or th position to a portfolio requires adding an investor’s th or th best idea at ensemble we invest our clients’ equity assets in  stocks this degree of focus provides the benefits of diversification while keeping our clients’ assets in our best ideas with this level of focus we are able to know every company in our portfolio inside and out research shows that the benefits of diversification are optimized at between  and  holdings yet the vast majority of mutual funds hold hundreds of stocks or more owning hundreds of stocks makes mediocre performance the most likely outcome most great investors over the years have instead focused their portfolios in a mix of stocks that prevents any one investment going wrong from damaging long term results while retaining the ability to keep their clients’ assets in their best ideas in addition to diversifying within our clients’ stock portfolios we work with each client to determine an appropriate level of lower volatility holdings – such as bonds andor cash – to maintain overall portfolio volatility at a level that fits his or her financial situation and personal outlook paretos diversification universe of public domestic stocks nyse and nasdaq  universe of sp  index  typical actively managed equity mutual fund portfolio  optimally diversified portfolio  like the pareto principle the majority of the beneficial effect arises from the minority of the causes ensemble invests in highlyfocused customized client portfolios of  to  positions selected by our own proprietary research we believe these positions offer the greatest potential for market performance as supported by academic research realworld studies and our own firms superior performance over the last  years portfolio management  investing vs trading we focus on making multiyear investments in companies we think will thrive over the long term our analysis focuses on the positive and negative developments that are likely to play out over the next  to  years or longer because we seek to benefit from superior longterm corporate performance in excess of market expectations our holding period is designed to match the multiyear period over which corporate performance unfolds our clients care primarily about the long term performance of their assets and our investment analysis is focused on meeting those long term goals the majority of investors instead focus myopically on the positive and negative developments that are likely to occur in just the next couple of quarters this short term focus leads investors to pay high prices for what’s hot now or sell at low prices in the face of transitory difficulties our average holding period for a stock is three or more years the average holding time of a stock by the typical wall street firm on the other hand is just  months other investors’ short term focus plays to our advantage allowing us to buy stocks that have fallen due to short term issues or sell stocks that have increased excessively in price based on passing good fortunes we believe investors are best served by seeking to benefit from longterm economic value creation at the companies in which they invest while actively tracking their portfolio and buying or selling when market prices make such transactions attractive typically this leads to longer holding periods however if our original assessment of a company’s prospects weakens or market prices increase dramatically in the short term we will adjust our position as necessary  monthsensemble average holding time vs  monthswall street average holding time portfolio management  fixed income over long time periods we believe that stocks will deliver superior investment returns compared to bonds and cash the price of stocks longterm outperformance is shortterm volatility therefore when clients have short to mediumterm needs for their assets or simply wish to avoid some of the volatility inherent in stocks we add bonds and cash equivalents to their portfolios rather than seek to take undue risk in this portion of client portfolios in search of slightly higher returns we focus on building very highquality portfolios of bonds that we believe fairly compensate investors in light of their reduced level of risk our primary concern in fixed income investing is credit risk — that is the risk the bond issuer will not deliver on its obligation to make timely interest and principal payments we focus on issuers’ financial health analyzing their cash flows leverage and liquidity – but also their operating histories and management strength in this sense our bond analysis is not that dissimilar from key elements of our stock analysis – and we perform this research regardless of whether the issuer is a corporation municipality or other borrower investing in bonds does not rest on credit analysis alone we are particularly mindful of interest rate and inflation risks as these factors will affect bond prices regardless of an issuer’s credit quality as a result these external forces can negatively impact those clients seeking reduced portfolio volatility or those who need to meet specific liabilities at given points in time so while we cannot control or even predict the direction of broad market forces like interest rates or inflation we do position our bond holdings to minimize those risks ultimately while bonds contribute to overall portfolio returns we believe they should primarily be a source of stability and relative safety in client portfolios in building our bond portfolios we seek to minimize risk and maximize peace of mind share  social twitter linkedin refer a friend skype with us more adv sitemap legalprivacy ensemble capital  bayshore highwaysuite  burlingame ca

gifting strategies the financial advisor landscape the financial advisor landscape includes stock brokers registered investment advisors wealth managers financial planners and many other financial professionals all of whom play different roles and have different responsibilities to their clients although many advisors use different terminology in general advisors come in some version of the following investment managers directly invest in a portfolio of stocks and bonds on behalf of their clients asset allocators outsource investment management via mutual funds or other investment vehicles and concentrate instead on which managers to hire on behalf of their clients fiduciary advisors have a legal obligation to act in the best interests of their clients and are paid to offer objective advice nonfiduciary advisors are salespeople like all salespeople they are paid to sell a product or service and have no legal obligation to offer objective advice or act in the best interest of their clients ensemble capital is a fiduciary investment manager we are paid to deliver objective advice our fees completely depend on the value of your account — rising when your account value increases and falling when it decreases our interests are aligned with yours — to make your investments grow while minimizing risk unless special circumstances exist we do not outsource investment management services and the only fee you pay is ours you do not typically pay a second layer of fees to mutual funds or other investment vehicles as do the clients of asset allocationfocused advisors financial planning  long term planning the planning advice you want when you want it whether you are working and building your portfolio in retirement or overseeing a complex multigenerational asset base ensemble capital can provide the advice you need as registered investment advisors our work with clients goes far beyond picking stocks and bonds when you hire

planning practice standards of the cfp® board whether you are focused on a single issue or a more comprehensive and complex plan we will help you achieve your financial goals define our planning

help you take into account life events that may change your initial situation or goals refine and repeat portfolio customization  custom built portfolios we are dedicated to producing the best riskadjusted returns possible in a unique portfolio that reflects your specific situation unlike many advisors who place clients in a “model portfolio” that reflect their generic investment needs – aggressive conservative income etc – we custom build each portfolio from the bottom up to fit each client when building your portfolios we take into account both quantitative and qualitative aspects of your personal situation most importantly every trade we place on your behalf will be made with your particular situation in mind rather than trying to make you conform to a cookiecutter investment model we spend the time and energy needed to customize a portfolio built just for you tax consequences before liquidating your existing portfolio we examine your tax situation and the implications of any unrealized gains or losses you might have if warranted we will continue to hold certain legacy positions in order to defer gains or losses until a more opportune time legacy holdings in addition to tax related motivations for holding legacy positions occasionally a client will have a holding of special importance in these cases we are happy to hold the position on a permanent basis while keeping the client updated on the investment characteristics of the holding employment implications being located midway between san francisco and silicon valley it is not unusual for our clients to work for companies whose prospects are driven by many of the same inputs that drive financial markets if desired we can customize your portfolio to help diversify some of the risk embedded in the nature of your work income needs in general we attempt to maximize the total return both income and capital appreciation of our clients’ portfolios however if you require a certain level of current income we will customize both your equity and fixed income holdings to meet this need portfolio customization  client service close contact with our clients is how ensemble provides superior financial

understand us and the investment decisions that we make on their behalf we believe that investments are far more than blips on a stock screen and enjoy the opportunity to explain the individual investments we make to clients who are interested unlike many firms who assign relationship managers to work with clients our investment management team works directly with you this means that when you have questions about specific investments in your account your portfolio manager is able to discuss our thinking in depth discussing our investment analysis and the financial markets with clients is one of our favorite parts of our jobs in addition to regular conversations and meetings our team is available at all times to answer any questions you may have or assist you in any way from opening accounts to transferring money to obtaining financial information we can be reached at any time and will provide you with what you need immediately build a more nuanced understanding of your financial life establish strong working relationships with your other advisors our investment management team works directly with you case study  financial advising john and wendy had recently retired and wanted to rethink their longterm strategy they came to ensemble capital looking for help to better understand their overall financial picture and to make sure that their investment strategy was aligned with their longterm goals the couple had a living trust an ira in john’s name and a large k with the employer from which wendy had recently retired their two children are adults and their daughter was expecting her first child we sat down with john and wendy in their home and spoke at length about their plans for the future they discussed their desire to maintain a relatively modest lifestyle while also being able to travel extensively they were also interested in setting aside money to help pay for their soontobeborn grandchild’s education since they had recently retired they were also contemplating becoming more involved in some of the nonprofits they had long supported and were interested in understanding how they could best provide financial support having witnessed the financial crisis of  and with memories of the dot com crash still vivid john and wendy were eager to figure out how they could maintain a stable conservative portfolio while making sure that their asset base supported their spending now and for the rest of their lives after getting to know the couple collecting details of their financial life and learning more about how they regarded money and the financial markets we set out a plan that we felt would balance their various priorities we then worked with john wendy their cpa and lawyer to put the plan in place the k was rolled over into a newly created ira to give wendy maximum control over her investment options we built out an asset allocation plan across the trust and two retirement accounts that reduced the impact of stock market volatility while also striving to make sure that their spending power would keep up with inflation over time and accounted for the fact that the couple did not currently need to take distributions from their iras but would be required to soon working with their lawyer we helped establish a trust account for their grandchild that would be available to use for both k schooling as well as college finally we established a small donor advised fund to maximize the tax benefits of the john and wendy’s charitable giving over time as john and wendy’s lives evolve their grandchildren grow up and their priorities change we’ll stay in close touch with them modifying their investment plan to keep it constantly aligned with their goals and objectives while our advice is rooted deeply in financial analysis it also recognizes that john and wendy are unique individuals whose feelings about money and financial markets are a critical input into designing an investment plan that works for them  to protect the privacy of our clients case studies appearing on this website are fictionalized but represent typical client engagements philanthropic planning about onequarter of ensemble assets under management are held in private foundations nonprofit endowments charitable trusts and other philanthropic accounts while our main efforts are concentrated on investment research and portfolio management we also have developed special expertise in philanthropic planning sean stannardstockton our president and chief investment officer is well known in the philanthropic community for his popular tactical philanthropy blog that he authored from  to  as well as his regular columns in the financial times and chronicle of philanthropy if you have an interest in maximizing the charitable impact and tax benefits of your giving we can work with you to develop a philanthropic plan that meets your needs we will then coordinate the creation of a private foundation donor advised fund charitable trust or other philanthropic account we work with both established philanthropic entities as well as help major donors design and implement philanthropic plans if you are a major donor who wants to establish a philanthropic giving vehicle we can help for established foundations we can provide a fresh perspective on your investment management needs we start by sitting down with you and reviewing your historical giving and goals for the future our first priority is to help you maximize your charitable impact once we’ve established what you want to accomplish we will recommend a giving vehicle or combination of tools that meets you needs we’ll also work with your accountant to design a plan that maximizes the tax benefits of your giving whether you decide to set up a private foundation donor advised fund charitable trust or a combination we’ll steer you through the process of implementation while we do not offer legal or tax advice we are very familiar with the tax and legal considerations of philanthropic planning and will work with you and your other advisors to put everything in place for new and existing foundations charitable trusts and donor advised funds we offer our investment management services with a specialized focus on the unique characteristics and goals of charitable accounts our philanthropic planning services are available to all clients for no additional fee private foundations donor advised fund charitable trusts private foundations are the most flexible of the various charitable vehicles they are a distinct legal entity that is controlled by your family when you make a gift of appreciated stock into your foundation you avoid paying capital gains taxes take an income tax deduction for the full market value of the gifted stock and permanently shield those assets from the estate tax foundations are unique philanthropic entities that can engage in a variety of innovative charitable strategies we help clients explore concepts such as loaning money to nonprofits making grants to international organizations or otherwise leveraging the private foundation in ways not available to individual donors in addition to the tax and operational benefits of starting a foundation there are important advantages for families who wish to engage in philanthropy together foundations are controlled by a board frequently made up of family members by providing a framework for coming together to talk about your most deeply held values and beliefs private foundations facilitate making philanthropy part of your family tradition while there is no minimum donation required to launch a foundation we generally feel that foundations should be considered by families who can make an initial donation of  million or more a donor advised fund is essentially a “charitable checking account” a donor advised fund allows you to avoid paying capital gains tax on asset transferred in take an income tax deduction for the fair market value of those assets and then send charitable gifts to nonprofits at whatever time is right for you assets in a donor advised fund grow free of taxation building your giving capacity a donor advised fund has the advantage of being incredibly simple and allows you to easily fund your philanthropy with assets you may not have considered in the past in addition to stock or cash you can deposit partial or whole interests in real estate privately held businesses and other nonpublicly traded assets into a donor advised fund in some cases donor advised funds may offer larger tax deductions than private foundations to families who make large gifts in relation to their annual income unlike a foundation which is controlled by a board selected by the donor a donor advised fund is an account held by a separate charity a donor advised fund gives you the option to recommend grants to any public charity all of the check writing and administration is handled on your behalf by reducing the after tax cost of giving to charity and by streamlining the giving process a donor advised fund can help maximize your enjoyment of philanthropy the nonprofits that offer donor advised funds require minimum donations of as little as  however ensemble capital requires an initial donation of at least  for major donors who wish to engage our services charitable remainder trusts crts pay income to an individual and at a later date pay the principal to a designated nonprofit crts are excellent vehicles for individuals who plan on leaving a portion of their estate to charity but need to continue receiving income from their investment portfolios charitable lead trusts clts pay an annual amount to a designated nonprofit and transfer the principal back to the grantor or another person at some future date these trusts can be structured to pull future tax deductions into the present or to significantly reduce gift and estate taxes on transfers of assets to heirs crts allow you to deposit highly appreciated assets often common stock real estate or privatelyheld business interests and defer paying capital gains tax when they are sold this allows you to tax efficiently exchange nonincome producing assets for a diversified portfolio you also receive an income tax deduction for the present value of your eventual gift to a nonprofit crts come in various forms with each having a different method of determining income payments ensemble consults with you to determine the best strategy to meet both current and future income needs by creating either a fixed income payment or an income stream that has the potential to grow over time clts give you two options to reduce your taxes if your objective is an income tax deduction a clt can be structured so that annual payments are made to a nonprofit and the principal is returned to you at some point in the future you can take an income tax deduction for the present value of the planned annual gifts in the year the trust is created alternatively a clt can name an heir as the beneficiary of the principal interest and be structured to enable a gift and estate tax deduction if you forego an income tax deduction you can use the present value of the annual payments to reduce the amount of the gift in this way you can make large transfers of assets to your heirs while minimizing the associated taxes case study  philanthropic planning laura has worked in silicon valley for  years and is turning her interest toward her philanthropic impact after working at a series of unsuccessful startups she cofounded a company that eventually was acquired by a major consumer web company now in her mid’s laura consults with new startups and has some significant investments in early stage companies but her main interest these days is in her philanthropic work she sits on the board of two nonprofits and has recently been learning more about how donors can achieve the most impact from their investments of time and money after spending time learning about laura’s past work in technology and her current nonprofit work ensemble capital proposed that she launch a private foundation in addition we suggested that she open a donor advised fund to receive a donation of her interest in a privately held business which would receive more favorable tax treatment than if donated to her private foundation in addition to building a platform for her philanthropic giving and crafting an investment plan that would support her philanthropic interests we also worked with laura to build a philanthropic policy statement that laid out her focus areas and clarified what she sought to achieve while laura uses her foundation and donor advised fund as vehicles to support her annual giving we also helped her explore other creative ways that she could advance her philanthropic mission recognizing that donors can bring networks and expertise to the table as well as money laura’s foundation organized a summit for a number of organizations she supports to learn more about how nonprofits can effectively deploy social media we also worked with laura to have her foundation make a loan to a nonprofit and recently she’s been exploring the idea of having her foundation offer scholarships to students from her home town who want to work in engineering or other technology related fields to protect the privacy of our clients
