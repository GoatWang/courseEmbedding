homeprecision immunotherapyarcelis platform arcelis platform argosadmin t about the arcelis® technology platform arcelis® is a precision immunotherapy technology that captures the spectrum of mutated or neoantigens and variant antigens that are specific to each patient’s individual disease it was designed to overcome immunosuppression by enabling specifically targeted durable memory tcells without adjuvants that may be associated with toxicity this platform technology is potentially applicable to the treatment of a wide range of different cancers and infectious diseases and is specifically designed to overcome many of the manufacturing and commercialization challenges that have impeded other personalized immunotherapies why precision is important in immunooncology like a shifting kaleidoscope every tumor pattern is unique to each individual mutations or neoantigens in the tumor andor overexpression of normal proteins can lead to malignant growth argos scientists have recognized that “onesize fitsall” therapeutic approaches have had only limited clinical success and have innovated a precise immunotherapeutic approach unlike any other with the potential to be revolutionary   the arcelis® process uses only a small disease sample or biopsy as the source of diseasespecific antigens and the patient’s own dendritic cells which are optimized from cells collected by a leukapheresis procedure our proprietary process uses rna isolated from the patient’s disease sample to program dendritic cells to target diseasespecific antigens these activated antigenloaded dendritic cells are then formulated with the patient’s plasma and administered via intradermal injection as an individualized immunotherapy   how does rocapuldencelt ags activate neoimmunity argos’ most advanced product candidate rocapuldencelt ags is being evaluated in the pivotal adapt phase  clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma mrcc it is an individualized immunotherapy that captures both mutated and variant antigens that are unique to each patient’s tumor and therefore specifically designed to induce an immune response targeting that patient’s particular tumor antigens so called “neoimmunity” is enabled when immunization with rocapuldencelt ags induces activation and expansion of new tcells both longlasting memory cells and killer cells that are specifically armed to attack to material unique to that individual tumor cancerpipeline  clinical trials hivclinical trials  opportunities argos therapeutics inc  product pipeline review
