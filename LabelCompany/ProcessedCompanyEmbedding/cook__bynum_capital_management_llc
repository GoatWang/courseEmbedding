across geographic regions industry sectors and market capitalizations this pure value investing philosophy has been heavily influenced by the teachings of benjamin graham john burr williams warren buffett and charles munger among others to minimize the risk of permanent capital loss and maximize longterm returns we make our investment selections using the following core criteria circle of competence we only invest in businesses whose core economics and future prospects we can understand and reliably predict we know our ability to recognize our limitations will be as important as our ability to execute competencies business we seek to invest in companies that have durable competitive advantages that allow them to produce predictable cash flows and earn high returns on equity for extended periods of time without sustainable competitive advantages a company’s results will be difficult to effectively forecast people we invest in companies whose management teams are capable and trustworthy think and act like shareholders employ conservative balance sheet and other accounting policies and make wise capital allocation decisions the risk of permanent capital loss can be lowered significantly if we only invest in businesses whose managers view shareholders as partners price we seek to invest in companies whose shares are trading at significant discounts to our estimate of their intrinsic values as this “margin of safety” serves to both prevent permanent capital loss when we make mistakes and also provide outsized returns when we are correct we use fundamental bottomup research to carefully assess whether an individual company meets these core criteria this research often includes but is not limited to review and analysis of company filings discussions with management visits to company facilities and conversations with the company’s customers competitors and suppliers when a company appropriately satisfies the first three of these criteria circle of competence business and people we will value it by projecting the future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and then discounting these ‘‘owner earnings’’ into presentvalue dollars using an appropriate interest rate we will only buy a company’s security only as long as it is trading at a large discount to our conservative appraisal of its intrinsic value learn more about why we

cook  bynum fund  click to explore subpages our investment philosophy why the arch building our portfolio why are we different how we think bookshelf why the arch as the supporting scaffolding was removed following the completion of a roman arch the responsible engineer was required to stand beneath it this approach ensured that the engineer designed and built the arch with a substantial margin of safety at cook  bynum we have applied the lessons of this highly effective quality control system in two distinct ways  first we only make investments in companies whose securities provide an appropriate “margin of safety” – meaning they trade at a significant discount to our appraisal of their intrinsic values  second we believe it is imperative to have our interests closely and fully aligned with those of our investors to accomplish this objective we invest substantially all of our liquid net worth alongside our investors and are more than willing to “eat our own cooking”  as a result we manage our partners’ money exactly how we manage our own we feel it is essential to our longterm success that we have partners who share our goals so we seek those who are focused on longterm investment results rather than shortterm market fluctuations  having partners focusing on the latter will almost certainly compromise our longterm results learn more building our portfolio

investment philosophy why the arch building our portfolio why are we different how we think bookshelf building our portfolio establishing and sizing positions we typically build concentrated positions in equity securities as we prefer to invest more capital in our best ideas recognizing that bigger stakes can be taken when information is adequate and outcomes are more certain  our assessment of the attractiveness of each potential investment is informed by our deep research shaped by our requirement of a ‘margin of safety’ and driven by the strict application of our core criteria among other considerations  this approach reflects our desire to make investments only when we feel that risk is low and potential returns are high  consistent with our longrange investment horizon we define risk as the probability that a business performs materially worse than we predict leading to a permanent loss of capital rather than a temporary decrease in the quoted price of a stock  we specifically reject the concept that price volatility is a form of risk and instead consider it our friend – an opportunity to either buy a business cheaply or sell it dearly  in fact because we anticipate being a large net purchaser of companies for the foreseeable future we welcome low and declining prices to build positions – even in positions we currently hold  we are only concerned with the intrinsic value of the businesses in which we invest  stagnant or declining prices in the face of solid business performance are simply an opportunity to own a greater proportion of the future profits of a business   the position size of and concentration in each of our ideas are influenced by the kelly criterion  our main takeaway from kelly is that a position’s size should be a function of both the security’s expected return and its potential range of outcomes such that although the math cannot be done explicitly in investing it implies two critical points when thinking about how big a position should be in a portfolio with the first point being more obvious than the second i     the larger the expected return the bigger the position should be and ii    the larger the possible range of outcomes the smaller the position should be as absolute value investors we are comfortable holding cash and equivalents in the absence of compelling opportunities that meet our minimum hurdle rate requirements  it is our obligation to not put our partners’ capital in harm’s way without the prospect of an adequate return and cash allows us to act quickly in volatile andor falling markets  we are staunch adherents to the belief that the avenue to superior returns is being “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful”  this investment strategy may not be the best way to earn high returns in any given year but we believe it yields a portfolio that avoids the permanent capital losses endemic to shortterm strategies and earns the highest cumulative returns over a  year time horizon selling positions while our longterm approach typically produces low turnover and extended holding periods we will generally sell a security under the following conditions »  we will begin to liquidate an investment when it appreciates to the point that it approaches or moves beyond our estimate of its intrinsic value  an investment reaching our appraisal may have further upside potential but it will no longer offer an appropriate margin of safety for putting capital at risk »  we will also sell any investment that has a material adverse change in business management or return prospects since we invested  negative developments by themselves do not necessarily trigger the selling of a position but should an event lower our appraisal enough or prevent us from reliably appraising the intrinsic value of the investment we will sell it  positive events may cause us to adjust our appraisal of value upwards  we appraise our positions on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the investment »  based on opportunity cost considerations we will generally sell relatively overpriced securities to buy relatively underpriced securities as these specific opportunities arise  this situation happens most often in times of market dislocations or disruptions learn more why are we different our investment philosophy  the cook  bynum fund as of  ticker cobyx nav   change
