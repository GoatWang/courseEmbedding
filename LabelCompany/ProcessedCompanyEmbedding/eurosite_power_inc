lockup expiration  quiet period expiration  cik  we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital purposes in connection with the development and installation of new energy systems such as cogeneration systems and chillers and for general corporate purposes which may include among other things potential acquisitions of companies products and technologies that complement our business although we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to any such transactions we believe that the main competition for dg products is the established electric utility infrastructure dg is beginning to gain acceptance in regions where energy customers are dissatisfied with the cost and reliability of traditional electricity service these endusers together with growing support from regulators are creating a favorable climate for the growth of dg that is overcoming the objections of established utility providers those companies are much larger than us in terms of revenues assets and resources we expect to compete with large utility companies by selling its electricity to the same commercial building customers at a lower price we will sell directly to each building customer but typically only supply  of the electricity needs of the building the remaining portion will be supplied by the electric utility in the united kingdom we will primarily compete with cogenco limited a subsidiary of dalkia plc an alternative energy company with customers in the  kw range energ holdings plc and jenbacher a subsidiary of general electric company other companies in the same market are clarke energy ltd ec power systems and baxisenertec uk in belgium most chp equipment manufacturers are nonbelgian companies including cogengreen sa capstone turbine corporation and cummins power generation inc which will be our primary competitors in the  kw range in spain we will compete with baxisenertec uk micropower europe guascor power cummins power generation inc icogen sa and pasch y cia sa icogen sa based in barcelona is the leading spanish supplier for systems below  kw engine manufacturers sell dg units that range in size from a few kws to many mws in size those manufacturers are predominantly greater than  mw and include caterpillar inc cummins power generation inc and waukesha a subsidiary of general electric company in many cases we view these companies as potential suppliers of equipment and not as competitors the alternative energy market is emerging rapidly many companies are developing alternative and renewable energy sources including solar power wind power fuel cells and microturbines some of the companies in this sector include general electric company bp plc royal dutch shell sunedison a division of memc electronic materials inc and evergreen solar inc in the solar energy space plug power inc and fuelcell energy inc in the fuel cell space and capstone turbine corporation  ingersoll rand plc and elliott turbomachinery a division of the elliott group inc in the microturbine space the effect of these developing technologies on our business is difficult to predict however when their technologies become more viable for our target markets we may be able to adopt their technologies into our business model there are a number of energy service companies that offer related services these companies include siemens ag honeywell international inc and johnson controls inc in general these companies seek large diverse projects for electric demand reduction for campuses that include building lighting and controls and electricity in rare occasions or cooling because of their overhead structures these companies often solicit large projects and stay away from individual properties since we will focus on smaller projects for energy supply we will be well suited to work in tandem with these companies when the opportunity arises there are also a few local emerging cogeneration developers and contractors that are attempting to offer services similar to ours to be successful they will need to have the proper experience in equipment and technology installation contracting equipment maintenance and operation site economic evaluation project financing and energy sales plus the capability to cover a broad region company description we distribute own and operate clean onsite energy systems that produce electricity hot water heat and cooling in the united kingdom and europe our business model is to own the equipment that we install at customers’ facilities and to sell the energy produced by these systems to the customers on a longterm contractual basis at prices guaranteed to the customer to be below conventional utility rates because our systems may operate at up to  efficiency according to the environmental and energy study institute energy generation and distribution efficiency versus less than  for the existing power grid we expect to be able to sell the energy produced by these systems to our customers at prices below their existing cost of electricity or air conditioning heat and hot water we offer natural gas powered cogeneration systems that are highly reliable and energy efficient our cogeneration systems produce electricity from an internal combustion engine driving a generator while the heat from the engine and exhaust is recovered and typically used to produce heat and hot water for use at the site we also distribute and operate water chiller systems for building cooling applications that operate in a similar manner except that the engine’s power drives a large airconditioning compressor while recovering heat for hot water cogeneration systems reduce the amount of electricity that the customer must purchase from the local utility and produce valuable heat and hot water for the site to use as required by simultaneously providing electricity hot water and heat cogeneration systems also have a significant positive impact on the environment by reducing the carbon or co  produced by offsetting the traditional energy supplied by the electric grid and conventional hot water boilers distributed generation of electricity or dg often referred to as cogeneration systems or combined heat and power systems or chp is an attractive option for reducing energy costs and increasing the reliability of available energy dg has been successfully implemented by others in large industrial installations over  megawatts or mw where the market has been growing for a number of years and is increasingly being accepted in smaller size units because of technology improvements increased energy costs and better dg economics we believe that our target market users of up to  mw has been barely penetrated and that the reduced reliability of the utility grid increasing cost pressures experienced by energy users advances in new lowcost technologies and dgfavorable legislation and regulation at the state and federal level will drive our nearterm growth and penetration into our target market we believe that our primary nearterm opportunity for dg energy and equipment sales is where commercial electricity rates exceed  per kwh attractive dg economics in the united kingdom and europe are currently attainable in applications that include hospitals nursing homes multitenant residential housing hotels schools and colleges recreational facilities food processing plants dairies and other light industrial facilities early in  american dg energy performed a feasibility study of the european market to determine the viability of expanding its onsite utility business into europe this study and business plan report reached the conclusions that a there is untapped customer demand to provide smallscale chp packages in the commercial sector through a fully financed outputbased electricity and hot water contract b there is a lack of competition in this space in the target customer segments hotel healthcare and multitenant residential and c the underlying economic fundamentals are attainable with a combination of sufficient spark spreads and government fiscal support the study analyzed the entire european market however it focused on the united kingdom spain and belgium as the primary markets to start operations the study estimated that there are over  sites in those three countries providing a  million annual electricity market plus a  million heat and hot water energy market for a combined market potential of  billion the data used to calculate the company’s market potential is derived by company estimates we purchase energy equipment from various suppliers the primary type of equipment used is a natural gaspowered reciprocating engine provided by tecogen inc or tecogen an affiliate of the company tecogen is a leading manufacturer of natural gas enginedriven commercial and industrial cooling and cogeneration systems suitable for a variety of applications including hospitals nursing homes and schools the internal combustion reciprocating engine is provided to tecogen by general motors corporation we were organized as a delaware corporation in july  our principal executive offices
