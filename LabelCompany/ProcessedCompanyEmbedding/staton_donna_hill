partnerships – reform begins from the grounds up rss feed tag archives donna hill staton may ’ dr charlene dukes removed from msde by governor larry hogan in our opinion we aver and therefore believe maryland state board of education president dr charlene dukes shown here has demonstrated a culture of corrupt leadership style and continues “an integrated pattern of pay to play” high suspension rates violation of due process rights manipulation inter alia during her tenure as president for maryland state board of education the maryland state board of education welcomed two new members on may th  chester e finn jr edd of montgomery county and andy smarick of queen anne’s county were appointed by governor larry hogan to fill two seats on the member board vacated by the departures of charlene m dukes edd and donna hill staton esq whose terms ended in  but had been staying on illegally during the tenures of dr dukes and ms hill staton the state board established a record of cover up and corruption in the state level that negatively impacted students in a variety of ways and staff dr dukes was appointed in april  to serve out the remainder of a previous board member’s term and was reappointed in july  under unclear circumstances  she served for three years as vice president of the board and was elected board president in july  in a suspicious manner and again in  and  ms staton was appointed in april  to serve out the remainder of a previous board member’s term and was reappointed in july  ms staton was in many ways a voice of reason and she will be missed on another note during the tenure of dr dukes the state board of education experienced a variety of longterm student suspensions and expulsions and only revised its school disciplinary regulations to focus on keeping students in schools and connected to learning after pressure from activists her product is very clear in the streets of baltimore where riots were experienced recently in short dr dukes was racist and discriminatory during her tenure with the board and supported institutionalized racism she will never be missed by many who know her illegal activities above all dr dukes continues a culture of corruption involving public funds meant for prince george’s county public schools pgcps she has been manipulative in a variety of ways and an embarrassment to prince george’s county it is her illegal actions and shenanigans which will cost the county schools close to more than a  million and possible tax hikes fronted by county executive rushern baker iii  share

howard countys legal and political history occurred this month when former judge donna hill staton was appointed to a highlevel post in the maryland attorney generals office although critical issues about the countys judiciary remain unresolved questions surrounding ms hill statons future have been answeredms hill staton the first african american judge in howard before being defeated at the polls last fall becomes one of attorney general j joseph currans two deputies her year on the bench demonstrated why citizens are fortunate to have her continue in the public sectorher new job should have enough challenges to test her legal mettle minus the political nonsense she encountered after being selected for the circuit court in  this time last year ms hill staton and her running mate judge diane o leasure were reeling from propaganda attacks on their competence and character male judges in the county even with a controversial verdict or two under their belts dont endure the fierce challenges these two didthrough it all both women maintained their dignity after ms hill staton lost her bid to retain her seat in the election she was disappointed but displayed class and graceshe says she entertained a universe of job offers from private firms and considered applying for the two recent vacancies on howards district court one of which has not been filled she instead accepted a job that probably pays less than many other options about  a year she earned more as a partner at the prestigious baltimore law firm of piper  marbury where she worked before her appointment to the benchin her new job ms hill staton will advise state agencies perform some litigation work and help train staff attorneys the job also broadens her options for the future which could include a return to the judiciary among those who have served as deputy attorneys general are howard circuit judge dennis m sweeney and us attorney lynne a battagliaher year on the circuit bench should serve her well
