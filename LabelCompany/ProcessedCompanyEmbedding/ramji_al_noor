time to ask questions like i wanted to but maybe thats because ive made improvements in my health and i dont need his help as much the first two times i saw him i was very impressed with his patience kindness and knowledge i felt he was actually concerned with me as a person and i felt his empathy he is also kind of friendly funny and down to earth i liked him as a person specialists can be cold but this isnt the case at all with this doctor was this rating useful  flag  submitted july   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgedr ramji was very kind and understanding one f the best

submitted july   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei found him a very good doctor overall knowledgeable caring and accurate was this rating useful  flag  submitted january   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgeits the second time i saw doctor ramji for a colonoscopy i have only positive comments to make about him and about the procedurewas this rating useful  flag  submitted november   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei saw alnoor early in the morning no crowd waiting and he was punctual his assistant was not in but someone elses assistant helped me and she was professional and courteous alnoor was friendly professional and courteous as well i found a solution to my ibs issues during my six month wait to see him i used low fodmap diet and as long as i eat low fodmap i feel great there is still a problem i can not eat anything but food from my own kitchen because of my high sensitivity so my problem is not really solved if i eat the wrong foods or if i am even the slightest bit cross contaminated  grain of wheat dairy or soyand possibly after amounts of certain high fodmap foods im extremely sick back to alnoor ramji his thought was just stick with the low fodmap diet it works it reminds me of the old joke  doc it hurts when i do this well then dont do that if i was some lazy patient that left my life in the hands of the gods i can half understand that kind of response from him but as much as i dont trust the gods with my fate i am religious in my approach to maintaining health and i made that clear to him yet he wasnt interested enough to offer to help me find the source of the problem im not the type to live with something wrong forever i fix things and that always requires going to the root of the problem unfortunately the medical profession most often goes with just treating the symptoms andor finding a way to live with the problem i believe in treating the symptoms during the acute phase but not as a longterm solution alnoor if you read this you seem like a nice guy i hope at least think about what ive said for those looking for a ye or ne i would have to say customer service was passable but treatment was a fail was this rating useful  flag  submitted september   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei have been suffering from undiagnosed nightly abdominal pain for over  years before i was referred to dr ramji he flatly refused to do colonoscopy and despite me saying antacid have progressively made me worse prescribed variety of ppis all of them made me much worse to the point that my pain was unmanageable i was lucky i guess that i got so sick while i was in germany and went under the care of specialists there who performed capsule endoscopy test and diagnosed me it turned out that antiacids were indeed a poison for my condition if only this doctor had listened to what i was telling hi instead of sticking to a textbook cookie cutter approach  highly not recommendedwas this rating useful  flag
