 employees  locations  media  see also  notes  references  external links historyedit peterffy talking about his handheld computers in a cnbc interview  in  thomas peterffy left his job designing commodity trading software for mocatta metals and bought a seat on the american stock exchange amex as an individual market maker the following year he formed his first company named tp  co to expand trading activities to several members under badge number  at the time trading used an open outcry system peterffy developed algorithms to determine the best prices for options and used those on the trading floor and thus the firm became the first to use daily printed fair value pricing sheets in  the company expanded to employ four traders three of whom were amex members in  peterffy renamed tp  co to timber hill inc he named it after a road to a favorite retreatpp– one of his properties on hutchin hill road in woodstock new york by  peterffy was sending orders to the floor from his upstairs office he devised a system to read the data from a quotron machine by measuring the electric pulses in the wire and decoding them the data would be then sent through peterffys trading algorithms and then peterffy would call down the tradesp after pressure to become a true market maker and keep constant bids and offers peterffy knew that he would need his employees to closely pay attention to market movements and that handheld computers would help at the time the amex didnt permit computers on the trading floor because of this peterffy had an assistant deliver market information from his office in the world trade centerp in november  he convinced the exchange to allow computer use on the floor in  peterffy sought to computerize the options market and he first targeted the chicago board options exchange cboe at the time brokers still used fair value pricing sheets which were by then updated once or twice a day in  timber hill created the first handheld computers used for trading as peterffy explained in a  interview the batterypowered units had touch screens for the user to input a stock price and it would produce the recommended option prices and it also tracked positions and continually repriced options on stocks however he immediately encountered opposition from the heads of the exchange when he first brought a inchlong  cm by inchwide  cm device to the exchange floor a committee in the exchange told him it was too big when he made the device smaller the committee stated that no analytic devices were allowed to be used on the exchange floor effectively blocked from using the cboe he sought to use his devices in other exchanges images of the displays used at the nyse to direct traders also in  timber hill expanded to  employees and began trading on the philadelphia stock exchange in  timber hill began coding a computerized stock index futures and options trading system and in february  timber hills system and network was brought online the system was designed to centrally price and manage risk on a portfolio of equity derivatives traded in multiple locations around the country in  peterffy introduced his computer system to the new york stock exchange nyse which allowed it however the stock exchange only allowed it to be used at trading booths several yards away from where transactions were executed peterffy responded by designing a code system for his traders to read colored bars emitted in patterns from the video displays of computers in the booths this caused the exchange and other members to be suspicious of insider trading which convinced timber hill to distribute instructions throughout the exchange describing how to read the displays in response the exchange required the company turn the screens away from the trading floor which prompted peterffy to hire a clerk to communicate with the traders via hand signals eventually computers were allowed on the trading floor in the s the company was located in the world trade center timber hill joined the options clearing corporation in  the new york futures exchange in  and the pacific stock exchange and the options division of the nyse the following year also in  the firm joined and began trading on the chicago mercantile exchange the chicago board of trade and the chicago board options exchange in  the company moved its headquarters to the world trade center to control activity at multiple exchanges peterffy again hired workers to sprint from his offices to the exchanges with updated handheld devices which he later superseded with phone lines carrying data to computers at the exchanges peterffy later built miniature radio transmitters into the handhelds and the exchange computers to allow data to automatically flow to themp in  timber hill joined the national securities clearing corporation and the depository trust company now merged as the depository trust  clearing corporation by  timber hill had  employees and had become selfclearing in equities in  the cboe was about to close down its sp  options market due to the options not attracting sufficient trader interest because of this peterffy pledged that timber hill would make tight markets in the product for a year if the exchange would allow the traders to use handheld computers on the trading floor the exchange agreed and more traders were attracted by the change in pricing today sp  options are the most actively traded index options in the us in  timber hill deutschland gmbh was incorporated in germany and shortly thereafter began trading equity derivatives at the deutsche terminborse dtb marking the first time that timber hill used one of its trading systems on a fully automated exchange in  timber hill began trading at the swiss options and financial futures exchange which merged with dtb in  to become eurex at that time timber hill had  employees while peterffy was trading on the nasdaq in  he created the first fully automated algorithmic trading system it consisted of an ibm computer that would pull data from a nasdaq terminal connected to it and carry out trades on a fully automated basis the machine for which peterffy wrote the software worked faster than a trader couldpp upon inspection the nasdaq banned direct interface with terminal and required trades to be typed in manually peterffy and his team designed a system with a camera to read the terminal a computer to decode the visual data and mechanical fingers to type in the trade orders which was then accepted by the nasdaqp  to edit interactive brokers inc was incorporated in  as a

is the largest shareholder contents  history   to    to present  operations  employees  locations  media  see also  notes  references  external links historyedit peterffy talking about his handheld computers in a cnbc interview  in  thomas peterffy left his job designing commodity trading software for mocatta metals and bought a seat on the american stock exchange amex as an individual market maker the following year he formed his first company named tp  co to expand trading activities to several members under badge number  at the time trading used an open outcry system peterffy developed algorithms to determine the best prices for options and used those on the trading floor and thus the firm became the first to use daily printed fair value pricing sheets in  the company expanded to employ four traders three of whom were amex members in  peterffy renamed tp  co to timber hill inc he named it after a road to a favorite retreatpp– one of his properties on hutchin hill road in woodstock new york by  peterffy was sending orders to the floor from his upstairs office he devised a system to read the data from a quotron machine by measuring the electric pulses in the wire and decoding them the data would be then sent through peterffys trading algorithms and then peterffy would call down the tradesp after pressure to become a true market maker and keep constant bids and offers peterffy knew that he would need his employees to closely pay attention to market movements and that handheld computers would help at the time the amex didnt permit computers on the trading floor because of this peterffy had an assistant deliver market information from his office in the world trade centerp in november  he convinced the exchange to allow computer use on the floor in  peterffy sought to computerize the options market and he first targeted the chicago board options exchange cboe at the time brokers still used fair value pricing sheets which were by then updated once or twice a day in  timber hill created the first handheld computers used for trading as peterffy explained in a  interview the batterypowered units had touch screens for the user to input a stock price and it would produce the recommended option prices and it also tracked positions and continually repriced options on stocks however he immediately encountered opposition from the heads of the exchange when he first brought a inchlong  cm by inchwide  cm device to the exchange floor a committee in the exchange told him it was too big when he made the device smaller the committee stated that no analytic devices were allowed to be used on the exchange floor effectively blocked from using the cboe he sought to use his devices in other exchanges images of the displays used at the nyse to direct traders also in  timber hill expanded to  employees and began trading on the philadelphia stock exchange in  timber hill began coding a computerized stock index futures and options trading system and in february  timber hills system and network was brought online the system was designed to centrally price and manage risk on a portfolio of equity derivatives traded in multiple locations around the country in  peterffy introduced his computer system to the new york stock exchange nyse which allowed it however the stock exchange only allowed it to be used at trading booths several yards away from where transactions were executed peterffy responded by designing a code system for his traders to read colored bars emitted in patterns from the video displays of computers in the booths this caused the exchange and other members to be suspicious of insider trading which convinced timber hill to distribute instructions throughout the exchange describing how to read the displays in response the exchange required the company turn the screens away from the trading floor which prompted peterffy to hire a clerk to communicate with the traders via hand signals eventually computers were allowed on the trading floor in the s the company was located in the world trade center timber hill joined the options clearing corporation in  the new york futures exchange in  and the pacific stock exchange and the options division of the nyse the following year also in  the firm joined and began trading on the chicago mercantile exchange the chicago board of trade and the chicago board options exchange in  the company moved its headquarters to the world trade center to control activity at multiple exchanges peterffy again hired workers to sprint from his offices to the exchanges with updated handheld devices which he later superseded with phone lines carrying data to computers at the exchanges peterffy later built miniature radio transmitters into the handhelds and the exchange computers to allow data to automatically flow to themp in  timber hill joined the national securities clearing corporation and the depository trust company now merged as the depository trust  clearing corporation by  timber hill had  employees and had become selfclearing in equities in  the cboe was about to close down its sp  options market due to the options not attracting sufficient trader interest because of this peterffy pledged that timber hill would make tight markets in the product for a year if the exchange would allow the traders to use handheld computers on the trading floor the exchange agreed and more traders were attracted by the change in pricing today sp  options are the most actively traded index options in the us in  timber hill deutschland gmbh was incorporated in germany and shortly thereafter began trading equity derivatives at the deutsche terminborse dtb marking the first time that timber hill used one of its trading systems on a fully automated exchange in  timber hill began trading at the swiss options and financial futures exchange which merged with dtb in  to become eurex at that time timber hill had  employees while peterffy was trading on the nasdaq in  he created the first fully automated algorithmic trading system it consisted of an ibm computer that would pull data from a nasdaq terminal connected to it and carry out trades on a fully automated basis the machine for which peterffy wrote the software worked faster than a trader couldpp upon inspection the nasdaq banned direct interface with terminal and required trades to be typed in manually peterffy and his team designed a system with a camera to read the terminal a computer to decode the visual data and mechanical fingers to type in the trade orders which was then accepted by the nasdaqp  to edit interactive brokers inc was incorporated in  as a us brokerdealer to provide technology developed by timber hill for electronic network and trade execution

historyedit peterffy talking about his handheld computers in a cnbc interview  in  thomas peterffy left his job designing commodity trading software for mocatta metals and bought a seat on the american stock exchange amex as an individual market maker the following year he formed his first company named tp  co to expand trading activities to several members under badge number  at the time trading used an open outcry system peterffy developed algorithms to determine the best prices for options and used those on the trading floor and thus the firm became the first to use daily printed fair value pricing sheets in  the company expanded to employ four traders three of whom were amex members in  peterffy renamed tp  co to timber hill inc he named it after a road to a favorite retreatpp– one of his properties on hutchin hill road in woodstock new york by  peterffy was sending orders to the floor from his upstairs office he devised a system to read the data from a quotron machine by measuring the electric pulses in the wire and decoding them the data would be then sent through peterffys trading algorithms and then peterffy would call down the tradesp after pressure to become a true market maker and keep constant bids and offers peterffy knew that he would need his employees to closely pay attention to market movements and that handheld computers would help at the time the amex didnt permit computers on the trading floor because of this peterffy had an assistant deliver market information from his office in the world trade centerp in november  he convinced the exchange to allow computer use on the floor in  peterffy sought to computerize the options market and he first targeted the chicago board options exchange cboe at the time brokers still used fair value pricing sheets which were by then updated once or twice a day in  timber hill created the first handheld computers used for trading as peterffy explained in a  interview the batterypowered units had touch screens for the user to input a stock price and it would produce the recommended option prices and it also tracked positions and continually repriced options on stocks however he immediately encountered opposition from the heads of the exchange when he first brought a inchlong  cm by inchwide  cm device to the exchange floor a committee in the exchange told him it was too big when he made the device smaller the committee stated that no analytic devices were allowed to be used on the exchange floor effectively blocked from using the cboe he sought to use his devices in other exchanges images of the displays used at the nyse to direct traders also in  timber hill expanded to  employees and began trading on the philadelphia stock exchange in  timber hill began coding a computerized stock index futures and options trading system and in february  timber hills system and network was brought online the system was designed to centrally price and manage risk on a portfolio of equity derivatives traded in multiple locations around the country in  peterffy introduced his computer system to the new york stock exchange nyse which allowed it however the stock exchange only allowed it to be used at trading booths several yards away from where transactions were executed peterffy responded by designing a code system for his traders to read colored bars emitted in patterns from the video displays of computers in the booths this caused the exchange and other members to be suspicious of insider trading which convinced timber hill to distribute instructions throughout the exchange describing how to read the displays in response the exchange required the company turn the screens away from the trading floor which prompted peterffy to hire a clerk to communicate with the traders via hand signals eventually computers were allowed on the trading floor in the s the company was located in the world trade center timber hill joined the options clearing corporation in  the new york futures exchange in  and the pacific stock exchange and the options division of the nyse the following year also in  the firm joined and began trading on the chicago mercantile exchange the chicago board of trade and the chicago board options exchange in  the company moved its headquarters to the world trade center to control activity at multiple exchanges peterffy again hired workers to sprint from his offices to the exchanges with updated handheld devices which he later superseded with phone lines carrying data to computers at the exchanges peterffy later built miniature radio transmitters into the handhelds and the exchange computers to allow data to automatically flow to themp in  timber hill joined the national securities clearing corporation and the depository trust company now merged as the depository trust  clearing corporation by  timber hill had  employees and had become selfclearing in equities in  the cboe was about to close down its sp  options market due to the options not attracting sufficient trader interest because of this peterffy pledged that timber hill would make tight markets in the product for a year if the exchange would allow the traders to use handheld computers on the trading floor the exchange agreed and more traders were attracted by the change in pricing today sp  options are the most actively traded index options in the us in  timber hill deutschland gmbh was incorporated in germany and shortly thereafter began trading equity derivatives at the deutsche terminborse dtb marking the first time that timber hill used one of its trading systems on a fully automated exchange in  timber hill began trading at the swiss options and financial futures exchange which merged with dtb in  to become eurex at that time timber hill had  employees while peterffy was trading on the nasdaq in  he created the first fully automated algorithmic trading system it consisted of an ibm computer that would pull data from a nasdaq terminal connected to it and carry out trades on a fully automated basis the machine for which peterffy wrote the software worked faster than a trader couldpp upon inspection the nasdaq banned direct interface with terminal and required trades to be typed in manually peterffy and his team designed a system with a camera to read the terminal a computer to decode the visual data and mechanical fingers to type in the trade orders which was then accepted by the nasdaqp  to edit interactive brokers inc was incorporated in  as a us brokerdealer to provide technology developed by timber hill for electronic

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump

putting extra focus on growing brokerage business after another disappointing quarter in market making interactive brokers group inc is focusing on the brokerage business long term travis hoium tmfflushdraw apr   at pm the ups and downs of revenue and earnings at interactive brokers group inc nasdaqibkr struck again in the first quarter of  trading and market making were down versus a year before but the company still reported a profit and is making longterm adjustments that could make the business more profitable for investors heres a look at what interactive brokers reported on tuesday after the market closed and where the business is trending image source getty images interactive brokers group inc results the raw numbers metricq q yearoveryear change net revenues  million   million    net income to common stockholders   million   million    diluted eps        data source interactive brokers group inc what happened with interactive brokers group inc this quarter theres more to the story at interactive brokers than the declines in the metrics above there were some positive developments particularly in the electronic brokerage business here are the highlights electronic brokerage was once again the bright spot of the business accounting for  million in net revenue and  million in income before taxes however these results were lower than in the same period last year when the division brought in  million in net revenue and  million in income before taxes the number of brokerage accounts rose  to  and customer equity was up  to  billion commission per daily active revenue trade dart rose  to  but darts per average account fell  to  and revenue per average account dropped  to  these figures drove the decline in the brokerage business in the quarter marketmaking revenue plunged from  million a year ago to just  million and there was a  million loss in the segment partly due to the losses options marketmaking activities will be shut down globally and management expects to incur  million in onetime restructuring costs as a result but  million in net expenses will be moved from market making to the electronic brokerage business corporate revenue and income before taxes were  million and  million respectively reflecting gains from interactive brokers currency hedging strategy a dividend of  per share was announced and will be payable on june   to shareholders of record on june   what management had to say the two big shifts management has made are generating higher commissions per trade which is helping offset the companys decline in trades per account but the decline in trading generally is a burden on the bottom line its also become clear that market making isnt what it once was after extremely volatile results in the last few years management doesnt see a longterm advantage in the business getting out of market making will likely make interactive brokers revenue and earnings a little less volatile and help focus the business on its strengths long term looking forward what investors should really take away from this earnings report is interactive brokers move to focus on electronic brokerage the growth in accounts and equity and the rising commissions per trade if trading volume bounces off its current low the companys revenue and earnings will surge as well but a quiet market isnt great for brokerage volume which is a big reason the first quarter wasnt as good as a year ago travis hoium has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends interactive brokers the motley fool has a disclosure policy
