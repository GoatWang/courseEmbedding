just the room but is based on all the related services that might not be of use to you hotel rates are constantly changing if an event is coming to town room rates will skyrocket since demand is at a

travel period etc with absolutely no room for deviation maybe youre staying two nights someone else could be getting a better price for one or three nights the refund process for hotel price
