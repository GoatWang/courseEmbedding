brief for appellee before sobeloff chief judge soper circuit judge and thomsen district judge sobeloff chief judge  this appeal involves a patent in the surgical stocking art and raises the twin issues the scope of the patentees invention and whether the defendant has infringed the district court held the patent valid but not infringed and the plaintiffs have appealed  the plaintiffs are james j purcell patentee frank c beacham coowner of the patent lititz knitting company a pennsylvania corporation which holds the exclusive license to manufacture the purcell stocking and johnson  johnson exclusive licensee for its sale the defendant is carolina lee knitting company inc manufacturer of the accused stocking it is a wholly owned subsidiary of rosedale knitting company purchaser of carolina lees entire output rosedale in turn finishes and packages the carolina lee stockings and resells them to scholl manufacturing company the president of both rosedale and carolina lee is e brand beacham and his son frank beacham one of the plaintiffs was until the institution of this litigation a director and vice president of the two companies  to meet the demands of the wearers mostly women surgical stockings for the treatment of certain peripheral vascular diseases must be attractive as well as therapeutically useful for years the industry had been unable to produce an entirely satisfactory stocking at first the stockings on the market were made completely of rubber they were heavy poorly ventilated and so unsightly that nylon stockings were frequently worn over them also in the prior art there was a stocking manufactured under patent no  issued in  to hinchcliff knit of rubber and nonelastic yarn silk or nylon in alternating horizontal stitches known in the knitting art as alternating courses its failing lay it is said in the fact that the nonelastic yarn restricted the rubber and did not permit the stocking to stretch properly and sufficiently a third stocking was made entirely of helanca a brand of synthetic crinkled and set yarn this yarn consists of multifilament nylon which has been subjected to a high twist and then heatset before being relaxed the effect is that the yarn when relaxed has a memory and will resume its twisted contracted state like a coil spring the restrictive pressure of helanca is much milder than that of rubber and the allhelanca stocking proved therapeutically useless and was not manufactured commercially neumager the patentee of the allhelanca yarn stocking sought in  to amend his application to include the simultaneous use of rubber with helanca but in the following year a patent examiner rejected the proposed amendment on the ground that it contained new matter the amendment was then withdrawn but it continued to be part of the neumager file wrapper this patent was issued in  as no   purcell a practical knitter with thirty years experience began experimenting with surgical stockings in  in august of that year he knit the first sample of the fabric which achieved his desired result his stocking was constructed of alternate courses of helanca yarn and rubber it possessed the stretching and constricting qualities imparted by the rubber but was made light soft porous and attractive to sight by the helanca yarn through the aid of the younger beacham who was purcells neighbor and who later in  became a coowner of the patent lititz and johnson  johnson became interested in purcells product and ultimately became licensees as above indicated  ray borda a vice president of carolina lee is the designer of the accused stocking he shared an office with frank beacham at carolina lee while the purcell stocking was being developed the accused stocking did not appear until later and it was claimed by plaintiffs that carolina lee became interested in surgical stockings only by having acquired knowledge of purcells great contribution and that the defendant simply pirated the disclosures made by frank beacham to borda the district judge however made no such finding he determined that rosedale and carolina lee first thought of manufacturing surgical stockings in  but because rubber thread was then too coarse to be knit on their fullfashioned knitting machines they abandoned the idea for the time being they entered into the manufacture of surgical hosiery when fine gauge rubber yarns capable of being knit on fullfashioned machines became available  the accused stocking consists of rubber courses alternating with courses that combine helanca with plain inelastic nylon  construing the purcell patent  pursuant to his application made in october  purcell was granted on march   a patent for his stocking no  in the specification the inventor notes the shortcomings of the prior art stockings and recites that his is made by knitting a fabric of some of the courses of rubber yarn and by interspersing said courses with other courses knit of an elastic textile but nonrubber yarn helanca continuing he specifies i knit this yarn under no tension so that the length of yarn used in each course will if stretched out straight be far in excess of the length of the course the net effect states the specification of the patent is that the feel weight and appearance of the stocking are improved without limiting the capacity of the rubber yarn to stretch throughout the claims the participial phrase is repeated said synthetic yarn being knit in its relaxed condition  at the trial the court was greatly concerned with the scope of the patent construing the claims in the light of the specification hutzler bros co v sales affiliates  cir   fd   the judge decided that although purcell had been issued a product patent the phrase knit in its relaxed condition refers back to the no tension language in the specification and denotes a process step the patent meaning that as the helanca is fed to the knitting needles it is to be subjected to no undue tension cf smith v goodyear dental vulcanite co   us    l ed  in re shortell   fd    ccpa patents  the use of this process according to the judge is an essential element of the purcell invention and the elimination of this element in the manufacture of another stocking will result in no infringement  the plaintiffs take issue with the judges interpretation they argue that the language under consideration has been misconstrued as incorporating a process step into the patent that in reality it was merely descriptive of the finished product and that the patentee meant only that the helanca when incorporated in the finished stocking was to be in a relaxed condition  this contention cannot be sustained the record abundantly supports the interpretation made by the district judge there is testimony showing that in the knitting process the length of yarn which is knit into a given course of stitches is determined not only by the size of the loops made by the knitting needles but also by the amount of tension or stretching exerted on the yarn as it travels to the needles from the spool or cone from which it is unwound thus if there is less tension on the helanca as it is drawn toward the needles more yarn is knit into each loop and more helanca finds its way into the finished fabric the more helanca in the finished stocking the less tension it is under there and consequently being in greater relaxation it tends to be more elastic purcell was well aware of this principle and it was because of it that his stocking was successful by removing certain conventional tension devices from the knitting machine purcell found that he could knit enough helanca into each of the alternating helanca courses so that they would stretch harmoniously with the rubber this was the process step which purcell evidently found essential and to which he referred repeatedly in his patent  in a pretrial deposition the inventor himself frankly admitted contrary to his present contention that in the art of the trade i knit this yarn under no tension as it is fed from the cone to the knitting elements this is what is meant by the specification in the patent application by no tension the inventor explained in his deposition he meant no undue tension experts produced by the defendant and credited by the district judge testified unequivocally that participial phrases such as that in the purcell patent claims are commonly used to denote a process step and that to one skilled in the art the no tension language refers to the yarn as it travels from the yarn cone to the knitting elements  considering the ambiguity of the phrases and the conflicting interpretations adopted from time to time by the plaintiffs themselves and considering also the defendants testimony we are unable to say that the district judge was clearly erroneous in his construction of the purcell patent we therefore need not concern ourselves with the defendants further argument that if the broader interpretation demanded by the plaintiffs were adopted the patent would be invalid for lack of novelty over the prior art as disclosed by neumager nor need we pass upon the related contention of the defendant that if the method of knitting is not a part of the patent then the patentee has merely substituted another material helanca yarn for that prescribed by hinchcliff inelastic yarn and this would not be sufficient foundation for the patent see goldman v polan  cir   fd    infringement  there is greater uncertainty however in respect to the district courts conclusion that the manufacturing method practiced by the defendant does not infringe the issue is whether as the defendant asserts it has omitted an essential process step of the patent and does not infringe montgomery ward  co v rogers  cir   fd   anthony v sherman  cir   fd   kay patents corp v martin supply co  cir   fd   sears roebuck  co v minnesota mining  mfg co  cir   fd   or whether as the plaintiffs charge the defendant does use the same process thinly disguised resulting in the production of a perhaps less efficient product but one which nevertheless infringes vacuum cleaner co v innovation electric co  cir   f  bakercammack hosiery mills v davis co  cir   fd  graver tank  mfg co v linde co   us    s ct   l ed  hartfordempire co v swindell bros  cir   fd   comparison of the two knitting processes and their products will be simplified if we advert first to the plain inelastic nylon thread which is introduced into the accused stocking in addition to the rubber yarn and the helanca yarn the defendant itself establishes that the inelastic nylon in its stocking is functionless while each course of its stocking according to the defendant contains  inches of fully stretched helanca yarn the inelastic nylon is slightly longer being  inches the stretching of the helanca therefore cannot be restricted by the plain nylon which merely floats in the accused stocking nor can the plain nylon restrict the stretch of the rubber yarn more than the rubber is restricted by the fully stretched helanca yarn which is shorter than the inelastic nylon  of course if the defendant in fact departs from the teaching of the patent not making a simulated departure merely while copying the essence of the patent it cannot be held liable for infringement see  amjur patents sec  p  it is equally axiomatic in the law of patents that the addition of a useless or unimportant item cannot avoid infringement but is recognized as a frequent resort of infringers to mask their true purpose  amjur patents sec  p  beach v inman ccndny  f   vacuum cleaner co v innovation electric co  cir   f  lampus v crozierstraub inc  cir   fd  holland co v american steel foundries  cir   fd  ackermans v general motors corp  cir   fd   we now pass to a comparison of the knitting methods respectively employed in the manufacture of the patented and the accused stockings to determine whether the defendants process is or is not sufficiently like that of the patent to constitute infringement  both stockings are made on fullfashioned knitting machines it should be noted preliminarily that the parties agree and the court has found that it is a practical impossibility for yarn to be knit by these machines under no tension at all for the guide wires over which the yarn is drawn together with such other necessary devices as the miniscule beard openings in the needles exert some unavoidable tension  the evidence shows that both parties knit their stockings without the use of spring tension devices sometimes attached to fullfashioned knitting machines in fact the only tension exerted on the helanca as it is knit in the accused stocking which is not exerted on purcells is that tension incidentally gained from the use of an additional springless disc through which the defendants helanca yarn travels and also a snarl eliminator the latter appliance merely reverses the direction of the yarn three times as it passes through and its primary function is simply to do that which its name implies to prevent the yarn from becoming snarled  while yarn tensions differ from time to time due to variable factors tension according to the defendant usually varies from ½ to  grams  grams being regarded as normal tension the defendants evidence is that it uses only ¾ to ½ grams tension and the record further shows that when the defendants machines are run at low speeds the tension is as little as ½ grams  according to the defense the slight increase in tension is sufficient to stretch the helanca yarn in its finished fabric approximately ninety percent possessing in that state stretch characteristics entirely different from the helanca yarn in the plaintiffs fabric and practically identical to the prior art stockings knit of rubber and inelastic nylon in effect the defendant argues the inferiority of its product contending that it uses helanca yarn for the wide sales appeal of the trade name of this crinkled and set yarn it insists that the helanca yarn in the accused stocking severely limits the capacity of the rubber to stretch  the plaintiffs on the other hand point to the absence of spring tension devices in the defendants knitting process and urge that the difference in tension in the two knitting processes is minimal the plaintiffs note that even in stockings knit with helanca yarn under  gram tension there is some stretch left in the helanca yarn they further argue that even if the defendant increases tension in its process the increase is without practical significance for it still knits its helanca yarn in a sufficiently relaxed manner to enable the stocking to stretch to useful widths thus following the art as taught by purcell but attempting to disguise its appropriation of his essential process step  faced with a difficult decision on this very close issue the judge accepted the opinion of the defendants expert witness that the defendant employs heavy tension in its knitting process contrary to the teaching of purcell on this basis the judge decided that the accused stocking does not function in the same way as the patentees and he concluded that there was no infringement  since the trial however scholl manufacturing co inc sole distributor of the defendants surgical stocking has twice published in widely read trade magazines an advertisement of the accused stocking which contains statements material to the issue of infringement and which also bear pertinently on the credibility of the defense witnesses and the good faith of the defendant this is made the subject of a motion by the plaintiffs in this court for leave to present additional evidence to the district judge  prominent in the advertisement is the boldly printed statement that the accused stocking is the only kind that does not depend on all rubber yarn for elasticity apart from the admittedly false boast of exclusiveness is the clearly contradictory claim that something other than rubber indisputably the helanca yarn gives the stocking its elasticity the advertisement asserts that the helanca yarn provides elasticity at the trial this was insistently denied and painstakingly sought to be refuted by the defendant in listing the advantages of the superior construction gained through the use of alternating    helanca crimped nylon yarn the advertisement states the alternating nylon threads prevent excessive stretching assure firm uniform support to all parts of the leg and foot italics theirs noteworthy is the fact that nowhere in the advertisement is the plain nylon mentioned and this of course highlights its uselessness thus the advertisement tends strongly to substantiate the plaintiffs argument that the helanca yarn in the accused stocking is purposely knit with enough reduction in tension so that it functions when used on a leg in the same manner as the helanca yarn in the patented product the plaintiffs maintain that by employing the process step of removing undue tension the defendant infringes it is because of this that the plaintiffs filed their motion to present additional evidence and argument on the motion was heard with the appeal  while advertising claims alone may not be sufficient to make out a case of infringement cf motorfrigerator co v frigidaire sales corporation  cir   fd  although they may give rise to other causes of action the courts have in numerous instances relied on advertisements as admissions by the defendant of the infringing nature of the accused product see e g potts v creager   us   s ct   l ed  gibbs v triumph trap co  cir   fd  schlicht heat light  power co v aeolipyle co ccscny  f   wheatley v rexhide inc  cir   fd   university of illinois foundation v block drug co dcedill  f supp  particularly in a close case such as this should the district judge be afforded an opportunity to weigh the additional evidence and to reappraise his findings in the light of it  the defendant carolina lee argues however that only scholl is responsible for the publication of the advertisement and that it should not be regarded as an admission by carolina lee in this case it should suffice to say that scholl has to date purchased the entire output of the accused stocking and that it is itself currently under suit for infringement in the northern district of illinois and rosedale is financing the defense in that case as well as this carolina lee and scholl being in substantially the same relation to the subject matter the admissions of the latter are clearly evidence against the former see  wigmore evidence  sec  et seq p  et seq the precise participation if any by carolina lee in the advertisement and whether carolina lee was the source of the information or material embodied in the publication will of course be important in determining the weight properly attributable to the admissions  this is a proper line of inquiry by the district judge as he has not had an opportunity to consider the additional evidence we will not pass upon it in the first instance without affirming or reversing the judgment the case will be remanded for the reception of the proffered testimony and for such additional evidence as the district judge may think appropriate and for his determination of the issues in the light of the amplified record  remanded without affirmance or reversal for additional testimony notes  ischinger the plaintiffs expert further demonstrated the inconsistency in the plaintiffs position when in an affidavit filed in a companion suit against scholl manufacturing co inc in the district court for the northern district of illinois he stated    the statement in the purcell patent specification i knit this yarn under no tension cannot properly or logically be interpreted to mean that the inevitable and always existent drag action on the yarn and the tension applied to the latter by the action of the sinkers and dividers is to be somehow eliminated in this instance and the helenca yarn somehow placed in straightline formation adjacent the needles while relaxed and so maintained throughout the loop and courseforming operation rather it might mean that the use of the usual standard or conventional tension devices may preferably be dispensed with italics ischingers         it is not necessary to the practice of the purcell invention that the helanca yarn be more than fully stretched in connection with its transformation into loops and courses by the knitting machine and this is accomplished without the use of usual tension devices as clearly developed by the testimony of the inventor purcell in his deposition filed herewith and in the manner above explained italics ours johnson  johnson brands  list of all jj consumer brand names  lists health  beauty brands the allaround

clause in this law now  usc  permits this preexisting uses of the red cross to continue a declaration made by the us upon its ratification of the  geneva conventions includes a reservation that pre us domestic uses of the red cross such as johnson  johnsons would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on aircraft vessels vehicles buildings or other structures or upon the ground ie uses which could be confused with its military uses this means that the us did not agree to any interpretation of the  geneva conventions that would overrule johnson  johnsons trademark the american red cross continues to recognize the validity of johnson  johnsons trademark in august  johnson  johnson filed a lawsuit against the american red cross arc demanding that the charity halt the use of the

red cross as a us trademark for medicinal and surgical plasters in  and has used the design since  the geneva conventions which reserved the red cross emblem for specific uses were first approved in  and ratified by the united states in  however the emblem was not protected by us law for the use of the american red cross and the us military until after johnson  johnson had obtained its trademark a clause in this law now  usc  permits this preexisting uses of the red cross to continue a declaration made by the us upon its ratification of the  geneva conventions includes a reservation that pre us domestic uses of the red cross such as johnson  johnsons would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on aircraft vessels vehicles buildings or other structures or upon the ground ie uses which could be confused with its military uses this means that the us did not agree to any interpretation of the  geneva conventions that would overrule johnson  johnsons trademark the american red cross continues to recognize the validity of johnson  johnsons trademark in august  johnson  johnson filed a lawsuit against the american red cross arc demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public though the company takes no issue with the charitys use of the mark for nonprofit purposes in may  the judge in the case dismissed most of johnson  johnsons claims and a month later the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached in which both parties would continue to use the symbol boston scientific lawsuitsedit since  johnson

the risk of ovarian cancer by around a third and that a  review of us studies came up with similar results for genital but not general talcum powder use jj were not convinced that the results were reliable furthermore ovacome said ovarian cancer is a rare disease and increasing a small risk by a third still still gives a small risk by march  over  us women had sued jj for covering up the
