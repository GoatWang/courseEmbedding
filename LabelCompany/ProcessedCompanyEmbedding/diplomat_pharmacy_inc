for our enewsletter download our patient book download an enrollment form for drug information click here helping cancer patients on their journey oncology treatment can be complex and patients require a coordinated care team to help them through prescribers to care and diagnose payors to provide adequate coverage and pharmaceutical companies to continue researching and as a specialty pharmacy we’re here to lead and offer patients the support they deserve our oncology program connects the entire health care team in a way that helps the patient stay on course as part of our hightouch service we frequently communicate with each patient to understand how they are feeling we develop innovative packaging options that help improve adherence we help find thirdparty financial assistance so each patient can access the treatments they need we help communicate side effects understand concerns and become an anchor for the patient mallory diplomat patient mallory diplomat patient in august  mallory ran  miles in her hometown’s annual race it was the fifth year she’d taken part so she was surprised when she struggled to finish less than a month later she would be faced with a cancer diagnosis and a search for a bone marrow match read more oncology how do you define success share your story we support nearly  oncology scripts per month in  we connected patients with m in thirdparty oncology copay assistance over  adherence to oncology medication our dedicated oncology team oncology care requires a team with expertise and experience but most of all with passion for what they do diplomat’s oncology patient care coordinators have spent years working with cancer patients they’ve listened to success stories large and small shared in their experiences and come to work every day to help in any way they can read more about what drives them below holly dodge oncology coe manager no two patients are the same and holly knows it when speaking with a patient “i don’t ever say ‘i understand’ because i couldn’t possibly understand everybody is different everybody has different reactions to different medications different reactions to different diseases so i could never understand what that specific person is feeling” she says instead she prefers to simply listen then help however she can as a manager of diplomat’s oncology center of excellence holly trains her team to do whatever it takes “i want to help everybody be that person that i want my family member to talk to i think for me one of the most unfortunate things about cancer is that i don’t know that i’ve ever met anyone that hasn’t been touched by it in some way” her team shares her passion for helping patients and it inspires her to work hard so they can keep fighting another day kamiya chatman oncology patient care coordinator “it’s a busy board” according to kamiya when she started working in diplomat’s translations board it was a little overwhelming kamiya’s job involves working with an interpreter to contact patients who don’t speak english after the interpreter gets the patient on the line kamiya springs into action sometimes you need to be creative though in certain languages there’s not a direct correlation for particular words “that can be a bit overwhelming” kamiya explains “because you may have to partner with the translator to figure out what you should say” since joining diplomat kamiya says the biggest lesson she’s learned is to listen “i’ve noticed that a lot of times … they’re just going through so much sometimes when you’re calling them to see if they just need a refill they can go on and share more information with you because they just want to talk about what they are going through “sometimes they just need that listening ear” lauren ganapini pharmacy liaison manager oncology for lauren cancer is personal her brother was diagnosed with leukemia in december  “the more i watched my brother his medical team and the impact his diagnosis had on my family the more i wanted to get involved in the oncology world somehow” one year after her brother’s diagnosis she became a pharmacy liaison in oncology “once you get your medication it’s not over for us there are copay assistance teams nurse adherence teams that help with sideeffect management and a pharmacist oncall  pretty much any question that a patient or caregiver has there’s someone at diplomat who can answer it or help them find the answer” while her brother was sick lauren learned firsthand how important hightouch care and reliable support was today he is doing well and lauren is determined to inspire her team to do whatever it takes to help the oncology community one patient at a time lucas zavadil pharmacy liaison oncology as an internal pharmacy liaison on diplomat’s sales team luc works to address any concerns or needs from doctors’ offices in his territory along with his outside sales partner courtney luc says “we are able to combine my direct and easy access to the office with all of her knowledge and facetoface contact so we’re working as a team alongside the office staff” giving people peace of mind is a big part of luc’s job “i can almost hear a sigh of relief on the other end of the phone because they know that whatever their problem is i’m going to find a solution for them—and not because it’s my job but because i care too” if luc had to boil diplomat down to one sentence it would be our philosophy “take good care of patients and the rest falls into place” “i think that that’s huge—and i think that’s through every department” michele ross oncology order entry technician supervisor two years ago michele’s mother died of breast cancer because of her experience with her mom michelle does the little things that show how deeply she cares for patients “if i can get a patient one week one more month six more months on a medication so they can be with their loved ones or their loved ones can have them around it’s worth it” she says after speaking with one patient who had a difficult day she went out of her way to make sure everything was okay “i couldn’t get this patient out of my head i couldn’t sleep i was so worried … i called her the next day and said ‘i just wanted to see how you were’ she said ‘i can’t believe how kind you are’” michele says gestures like this are just one way to show our patients how much we care nathan smith senior pharmacy liaison oncology every day nate works with prescriber offices to make sure patients are getting what they need for him being able to make the nurses’ or doctors’ lives easier is the most rewarding part of his job as a senior pharmacy liaison “to think that diplomat is doing such a good job for their patients that the offices think of us as part of their team as an extension of their office instead of just a specialty pharmacy … that’s when you know you did your job … you’re no longer just diplomat you’re a part of their team as well” he says in the background he adds “our entire sales team down to our pharmacists our nurses our patient care coordinators orderentry techs and member benefit managers we all have the same goals in mind” everyone is doing their part so nate can coordinate with the office allowing the doctors and nurses more time to focus on what matters most the patient ryan martus oncology order entry technician every morning at  o’clock ryan gets his plan of attack “i don’t know what i’ll be assigned until i get that” ryan arrives early so that he can get settled in and attack the day for him ryan explains “embracing change keeps me focused” ryan first came to work at diplomat because he believes that the company’s values reflect his own “our prescription represents someone’s entire life—and their future” with that in mind ryan does everything he can to ensure each patient is taken seriously once a prescription came across his desk that didn’t seem right—for good reason “i think it was a completely different dose and it’s our standard practice that if you didn’t … let us know this is a dose change we’re not sending this out “it’s not about getting it done as fast as possible it’s not about getting out at  o’clock it all comes back to loving patients—that’s all you have to do”  diplomat drug data   diplomat funding results   diplomat adherence reporting  more information for prescribers payors pharma patients click
