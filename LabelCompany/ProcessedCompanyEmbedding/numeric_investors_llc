corporations compared to llcs knowledge centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the

is in the details  research  man numeric the devil is in the details one persistent narrative across the investment industry is that quantitative strategies are all the same we analyze the same data read the same research and use the same concepts to identify attractive opportunities but at man numeric we believe the devil is in the details how one adjusts and transforms that common dataset could make a significant difference to the risk and return profile created by a particular model including differentiating between real alpha and what has become known as smart beta this paper is also accompanied by a video recorded as part of man numerics unconventional views series  march  download authors robert furdak cfa cocio of man numeric rob was named chief investment officer of man numeric ‘numeric’ in  and serves as chairman of the investment committee he is also a member of the man group executive committee rob joined numeric in  as director of international strategies and has designed and launched numeric’s japanese european and world strategies in addition to his cio role rob is the head of the usglobal group prior to joining numeric rob was a principal in the active international group at state street global advisors during his eight years there rob performed quantitative research on country currency and stockselection strategies in the international markets and was the principal architect of state street’s active emerging markets investment process previously rob worked at harvard management company rob received a bba in finance from the university of michigan and earned an mba in finance at the university of chicago rob is also a cfa charterholder conventional thinking is that all quantitative managers are the same we analyze the same data read the same academic research and use the same concepts to identify attractive stocks but the unconventional view is that the devil is in the details how one adjusts and transforms that common dataset makes a big difference in the returns and risk profile of a particular model including differentiating between alpha and what has become known as smart beta value is the foundation on which many quantitative equity investment strategies are built it started fundamentally with graham and dodd in the ’s and exploded quantitatively in the ’s and ’s as the data and computing power improved buying cheap stocks based on a particular metric such as earnings asset value or cash flow or even a more sophisticated value model may all seem similar to the uninitiated but most value models have certain persistent biases cheap stocks usually have some warts they tend to be lower growth more levered and riskier as an investor when you want to buy value as a concept you are not trying to gain exposure to growth leverage or risk if you can eliminate those biases you can design a model that gets to the core of the concept without some of the toxic baggage yes quantitative investing is very scientific but there is some art involved in how you construct a particular signal let’s take a look at how detailed adjustments can affect the efficacy of value models that most people would think would be highly correlated the chart below shows the returns of five us value models in increasing levels of sophistication over the last dozen years firstly the famafrench high minus low portfolio the fama french studies are the basis of the value orientation of many quantitative managers but focuses solely on book to price that has a  annual return with  volatility then we have the industry adjusted earnings to price model selecting the cheapest companies based on earnings to price compared to industry peers that has a  return with  volatility now let’s look at the barra value – calculated by msci barra that uses multiple indicators to measure cheapness such as sales assets and operating income it has a  return and  volatility our proprietary fair value model – uses industry relative valuation with adjustments for growth quality and a stock’s risk that has an  return and  volatility as you can see the returns become progressively better as the value models become more evolved additionally the volatility of the models decreases as the signals are neutralized to some of their inherent biases these effects are not just manifested in value models we observe them in models like momentum and quality as well the devil is not just in the details of how one constructs individual models it is also relevant in how you combine the models into an overall signal to construct your portfolio smart beta has gained a lot of attention in the recent years proponents of factorbased smart beta portfolios advocate that you gain exposure to these academically proven concepts like value and momentum in transparent rulesbased portfolios however these generic factors can be cyclical subject to periods of underperformance and contain unwanted biases making detailed adjustments can help smooth out some of this volatility and perhaps make your smart beta alpha  famafrench factor – hml high minus low is the average return on the two value portfolios minus the average return on the two
