and guerrilla marketing and iii expand our platform through line extensions our sales have been seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer and warmer months as a result our operating results from one fiscal quarter to the next may not be comparable additionally our operating results are affected by numerous factors including changes in consumer preference for beverage

estimates discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to collection of receivables inventory obsolescence sales returns and nonmonetary transactions such as stock and stock options issued for services we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe there have been no changes to our critical accounting policies subsequent to the filing of our annual report on form k for the year ended december   comparison of the three months ended march   to the three months ended march   net sales net sales for the three months ended march   were  compared with sales of for the three months ended march   a  increase this increase is primarily the result of chain authorizations secured by our sales team for reset of accounts beginning in february  and continuing through may  these authorizations have also allowed our team to secure distributor partners in  states many of these distributors received their initial shipments in february and march with the remaining distributors set to receive their initial shipments in april and may we have expanded distribution of aquaballr with national accounts in the grocery and convenience markets and we have built out our direct store delivery dsd network into  states during the past twelve months with resets continuing through may  our marketing and sales teams are now focused on increasing brand awareness and improving velocities moving through our current retailers as well as adding new placements with strategic accounts the percentage that each product category represented of our net sales is as follows three months ended  table of contents gross profit loss and gross margin gross profit for the three months ended march   was  compared to gross loss of  for the three months ended march   gross profit as a percentage of revenue gross margin during three months ended march   was  compared to negative  for the same period in  this increase in gross profit is a great improvement for our company and is a direct result of our relationship with niagara bottling who provides finished goods to the company and bills the company for the product as it is shipped to customers allowing our costs to become more consistent it is also attributable to our shift away from focusing on the lowmargin club channel to the mainstream grocery and convenience channels we expect margins to maintain margins in the  range moving forward sales general and administrative expense sales general and administrative expenses were  for the three months ended march   as compared to  for the three months ended march   this period over period increase of  is the result of increased peoplerelated expenses and travel expenses as well as marketing expenses at new retailers each resulting from the first quarter of  being a

marketability of the companys products to the point at which the company can sustain operations managements plans are to continue to contain expenses expand distribution and sales of its aquaballrnaturally flavored water as rapidly as economically possible and raise capital through equity andor debt offerings to execute the companys business plan and achieve profitability from continuing operations the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result in the event the company is unsuccessful in its plans the company has financed its operations through sales of equity and to a lesser degree cash flow provided by sales of aquaballr despite recent sales of preferred stock as described below funds generated from sales of shares of our preferred stock or other equity or debt securities and cash flow provided by sales may be insufficient to fund our operating requirements for the next twelve months as a result we may require additional capital to continue operating as a going concern no assurances can be given that we will be successful in the event we are unable to obtain additional financing in the next year we may not be able to fund our working capital requirements and therefore may be unable to continue as a going concern  table of contents recent capital raising activity january  note exchange on
