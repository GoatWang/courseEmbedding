graduated from denison university in  with a ba in english he is a member of the delta upsilon fraternity his greatgrandfather sigmund eisner was one of the first uniform suppliers to the boy scouts of america abc and paramount after two brief stints at nbc and cbs barry diller at abc hired eisner as assistant to the national programming director eisner moved up the ranks eventually becoming a senior vice president in charge of programming and development in  diller who had by then moved on to become chairman of paramount pictures recruited eisner from abc and made him president and ceo of the movie studio during his tenure at paramount the studio turned out such hit films as saturday night fever grease the star trek film franchise and beverly hills cop and hit tv shows such as happy days laverne  shirley cheers and family ties diller left paramount in  and as his protege eisner expected to assume dillers position as studio chief when he was passed over for the job though he left to look for work elsewhere and lobbied for the position of ceo of the walt disney company disney walt disney productions had been struggling since its founders death in  and had narrowly survived takeover attempts by corporate raiders when its shareholders sid bass and roy e disney brought on eisner and former warner brothers chief frank wells to replace ron w miller in  and turn the company around since the passing of the disney brothers the successive ceos had been men who spent their careers working for walt disney eisner was the first outsider to try for the top spot during the second half of the s and s the studio revitalized and the division had a golden age with annual box office hits with such regularity that even their creative structure started to be known as the disney formula citation needed disney also broadened its adult offerings in film when then disney studio chairman jeffrey katzenberg acquired miramax films in  disney acquired many other media sources including abc and espn during the early part of the s eisner and his partners set out to plan the disney decade which was to feature new parks around the world existing park expansions new films and

including a who framed roger rabbit franchise frank wells died in a helicopter crash in  the lion king which is the most successful handdrawn animated picture was released slightly over two months later in his memory shortly thereafter jeffrey katzenberg resigned and formed dreamworks skg with partners steven spielberg and david geffen because eisner would not appoint katzenberg to wells nowavailable post instead eisner recruited his friend michael ovitz one of the founders of the creative artists agency to be president with minimal involvement from disneys board of directors which at the time included oscarwinning actor sidney poitier the ceo of hilton hotels corporation stephen bollenbach former us senator george mitchell yale dean robert a m stern and eisners predecessors raymond watson and card walker ovitz lasted only  months and left disney in december  via a no fault termination with a severance package of  million in cash and  million stock options worth roughly  million at the time of ovitzs departure the ovitz episode engendered a long running derivative suit which finally concluded in june  almost ten years after it began chancellor william b chandler iii of the delaware court of chancery despite describing eisners behavior as falling far short of what shareholders expect and demand from those entrusted with a fiduciary position found in favor of eisner and the rest of the disney board because they hadnt violated the letter of the law namely the duty of care owed by a corporations officers and board to its shareholders the save disney war and

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a

jewish i am jewish i went to an episcopal high school i went to a baptist college ive taken every comparativereligion course that was available god i have no idea michael eisner god i am school many people you think are individual achievers in fact have either a strong spousal partner over many years or a business partner whos either in the background not given enough publicity or less egocentric michael eisner business strong partner succeeding is not really a life experience that does that much good failing is a much more sobering and enlightening experience michael eisner life good experience it is rare to find a business partner who is selfless if you are lucky it happens once in a lifetime michael eisner leadership business well when youre trying to create things that are new you have to be prepared to be on the edge of risk michael eisner risk trying you if its not growing its going to die michael eisner die growing going if youre soft and fuzzy like our little characters you become the skinny kid on the beach and people in this business dont mind kicking sand in your face michael eisner business beach mind theres no good idea that cant be improved on michael eisner good idea good idea a company that pays attention to the family unit is a successful company we dont isolate the family we dont make rides that say hey mom dad you go sit on the bench michael eisner family dad mom we cannot escape that hollywood is in the middle of a wave of technological change the current angst over all the implications of new entertainment technology is nothing new michael eisner change technology wave you just have to make sure the model youre working on does not undersell your product michael eisner working you product when i read biographies im only interested in the first few chapters im not interested in when people become successful im interested in what made them successful michael eisner successful people first graduate school is a place to hide for a couple of years michael eisner school place years my best idea was to not accept my wifes negative reaction when i asked her to marry me michael eisner best wife me i gravitate toward the team thing im not a golfer  i much prefer basketball michael eisner team basketball gravitate i find that once you get into a position where you can afford a pair of shoes and a decent level of living success in itself is empty michael eisner success shoes living the odds of being successful are the same for every group that is educated in america its just that the group that is not wealthy is  percent of the population so if there are  successful people in a room probably  out of  came from more modest means michael eisner america successful people eventually the consumer will come to appreciate the
