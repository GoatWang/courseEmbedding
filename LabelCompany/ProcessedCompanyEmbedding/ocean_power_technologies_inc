seton hall university pb — ocean power technologies pb  opt’s pb can act as an uninterruptable power supply ups which constantly recharges itself by harvesting energy from the waves it is oceandeployed moored and floats over the point of use and can operate in any ocean depth over  meters and up to  meters  kmthe pb supplies power continuously to onboard payloads or equipment located on the seabed while also providing real time data transfer and communication to remote shore facilities the pb is sized and designed to store sufficient electric energy to provide reliable ride through power in extended periods of flatcalm seas     the conversion of wave energy into electric power is carried out through a direct drive generator that continuously charges an onboard battery pack energy storage system power from the battery is delivered to meet application and enduser needs this is particularly advantageous for applications that have varying power requirements including continuous and larger occasional peaksopt has designed the pb to minimize operational costs opex whereby deployment and recovery thereof is simplified leveraging vessels widely employed in offshore marine operations the pb can be either towed to site or deployed from a vessel’s deckmaintenance intervals by design are every  years the pb control and management system includes selfmonitoring data collection processing and transmittal to allow proactive maintenance strategies thus increasing availability and operational effectivenessthe pb technology was demonstrated for a us navy project to provide power to coastal security networks and survived rigorous sea trials including operation off the new jersey coast through hurricane irene in  it is designed to be packaged and transported in a standard  foot iso shipping container excluding the moorings exterior payloads are anticipated to be shipped in the iso shipping container and would require minimal onsite preparation to mount on the

and analysis our fiscal year ends on april  references to fiscal  are to the fiscal year ended april   overview we are commercializing proprietary systems that generate electricity by harnessing the renewable energy of ocean waves our powerbuoy systems use proprietary technologies to convert the mechanical energy created by the rising and falling of ocean waves into electricity we currently have developed our pb powerbuoy product since fiscal  government agencies have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues which were largely for the support of our product development efforts our goal is that an increased portion of our revenues will be from the sale of products and services as compared to revenue from grants to support our product development efforts as we continue to advance our proprietary technologies we expect to have a net use of cash in operating activities unless or until we achieve positive cash flow from the commercialization of our products and services we are marketing our powerbuoy which is designed to generate power for use independent of the power grid to customers that require electricity in remote locations we believe there are a variety of potential applications for our powerbuoy within markets such as oil and gas ocean observing security and defense and as well as other markets which we refer to collectively as autonomous application markets we were incorporated in new jersey in  began business operations in  and were reincorporated in delaware in  we currently have five whollyowned subsidiaries ocean power technologies ltd organized under the laws of the united kingdom reedsport opt wave park llc organized under the laws of oregon and oregon wave energy partners i llc organized under the laws of delaware ocean power technologies australasia pty ltd opta organized under the laws of australia opta owns  of victorian wave partners pty ltd vwp which is also organized under the laws of australia we acquired the remaining  of opta which we did not previously own in september  table of contents product development the development of our technology has been funded by revenue generating projects capital we raised and by development engineering contracts we received starting in fiscal  including projects with the doe the us navy the department of homeland security and mes please see item  of this annual report business  customers and historic projects for more information through these historic projects we also continued development of our powerbuoy technologies we are continuing to focus on marketing and developing our powerbuoy products and services for use in autonomous power applications during fiscal  we continued to focus on the commercialization of our powerbuoy technology and our pb product in autonomous application markets we completed our work under our doe contract that focused on further optimization of our modular pto technology and delivered the project final report to the doe in the prior year in the prior year we successfully completed the final stage and associated review with the doe of the contract deliverables during which the doe reviewed advancements related to pto design aspects such as reliability cost take out manufacturability and scalability as we continued to focus on the development and validation of our pb powerbuoy commercial product our activities concentrated mainly on implementing all of our lessons learned during our efforts in the prior fiscal year from our ocean deployments and accelerated life testing alt the resulting improved pb powerbuoy was deployed off the coast of new jersey in july of  and was retrieved early december  upon completing all intended testing and validation inspection and refurbishment of the pb powerbuoy were completed and this pb was shipped for delivery to mes in japan to fulfill the requirements of our lease with mes including a deployment off of kozushima island in the pacific ocean alt of the pb commercial pto is ongoing with no failures to date in addition to the deployment of the pb powerbuoy the prior generation precommercial pb pba was fitted with a sensor that collects tagged marine mammal migration information as well as with a selfcontained ocean observing payload scoop the marine mammal migration detection sensor was attached to the pba powerbuoy as part of an agreed scope of work with the wildlife conservation society wcs through a memorandum of agreement between wcs and opt the scoop payload was integrated into pba to complete the phase  work scope of a cooperative research and development agreement crada between the national data buoy center ndbc and opt the pba deployed off the coast of new jersey in may  was retrieved in october  from july  through october  both pba and pb were concurrently deployed generating valuable performance validation data both the ndbc scoop as well as the wcs tagged mammal migration detection sensor met all of their performance requirements this precommercial powerbuoy referred to as pba has now undergone a full upgrade and has achieved full commercial status by retrofitting it with the final commercial pto including our modular energy storage system and to make it available to support our ongoing commercialization efforts in addition to the pb commercial product validation activities a concerted effort has been underway which focuses on proactively implementing additional features driven by extensive and direct discussions with potential users and customers in our target markets such features include  the design development and implementation of a versatile mooring interface that allows the pb to accommodate various types of mooring configurations depending on the specifics and the needs of the customer eliminating the need for a redesign to the device  the design development and implementation of a flexible power transmission system intended to support delivery of power and communication capabilities to customer payloads which are external to the powerbuoy and which may reside in the water column or on the seabed additionally and building upon our initial success in implementing an autoballast system in our commercial pb we further enhanced this feature in order to achieve faster and more cost effective pb deployments and retrievals further the development of our pb the next scaleup of our autonomous powerbuoy is underway in accordance with our product roadmap we completed the preliminary design of our pb in fiscal  we believe the pb powerbuoy would have a peak power generation rating of kw with a nominal ess rating of  kwh and an average continuous power output that depends on the deployment sites metocean conditions while this scaleup leverages every aspect of the product development and validation of the pb it may also strategically position the product to allow opt to respond to higher power needs as expressed by potential endusers and customers in our target markets table of contents as previously stated the pb has achieved commercial status through a series of design iterations which focused on improving its reliability and survivability in the ocean environment though the pb will continue to undergo further enhancements through customary product life cycle management we believe the pb has achieved a maturity level for immediate commercial use we believe that the pb will generate and store sufficient power to address various application requirements in our target markets our product development and engineering efforts are focused in part on increasing the energy output and efficiency of our powerbuoys and if we are able to do so we believe the powerbuoy would be useful for additional applications where cost savings and additional power are required by our potential customers we continue to explore opportunities in these target markets and we have not yet finalized any product offerings in these potential markets we believe that by increasing the energy output of our powerbuoys we may be able to address larger segments of our target markets by improving our design and manufacturing we also seek to reduce the cost of our powerbuoys through further design iterations and manufacturing rampup in so doing we seek to improve customer value displace additional incumbent solutions and become a viable power source for new applications in our target markets we also are continuing to work to develop solutions seeking to improve our products durability and reliability and to reduce their cost for example the redesigned pb leverages our knowledge base from past designs to incorporate new design features which we believe will improve its reliability and efficiency including a redesigned pto and a higher efficiency and higher voltage ess in july  we deployed our first commercial pb powerbuoy off of the coast of new jersey this deployment was the final validation of the pb prior to the march  sixmonth lease of the pb powerbuoy under a previously announced customer agreement in april  our commercial pb was deployed off the coast of kozushima island in japan as part of this lease and continues to operate meeting all project requirements capital raises on june   we entered into a securities purchase agreement which was amended on june   as amended the purchase agreement with certain institutional purchasers the purchasers pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock together with warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock each share of common stock was sold together with a warrant to purchase  of a share of common stock at a combined purchase price of  the net proceeds from the offering to us were approximately  million after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us but excluding the proceeds if any from the exercise of the warrants issued in the offering the warrants have an exercise price of  per share will be exercisable on december   and will expire five years following the date of issuance on july   the company entered into the second amendment to the purchase agreement the second amended purchase agreement with certain purchasers the july purchasers pursuant to the terms of the second amended purchase agreement the company sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock together with warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock each share of common stock was sold together with a warrant to purchase  of a share of common stock at a combined purchase price of  the net proceeds to the company from the offering were approximately  million after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by the company but excluding the proceeds if any from the exercise of the warrants issued in the offering the warrants were exercisable immediately at an exercise price of  per share the warrants will expire on the fifth on october   the company sold  shares of common stock at a price of  per share which includes the sale of  shares of the companys common stock sold by the company pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment option by the underwriters in a public offering the net proceeds to the company from the offering were approximately  million after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by the company table of contents on may   the company sold  shares of common stock at a price of  per share which includes the sale of  shares of the companys common stock sold by the company pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment option by the underwriters in a public offering the net proceeds to the company from the offering were approximately  million after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by the company the sale of additional equity or convertible securities could result in dilution to our stockholders if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations we do not have any committed sources of debt or equity financing and we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us when needed or at all if we are unable to obtain required financing when needed we may be required to reduce the scope of our operations including our planned product development and marketing efforts which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results if we are unable to secure additional financing we may be forced to cease our operations backlog as of april   our negotiated backlog was  million as of april   our backlog was negligible in  we have excluded from backlog the suspended utility scale project with mes as we do not expect work under that contract to continue due to the shift in focus to an autonomous pb based project subsequently on may   we entered into a contract with mes totaling approximately  million a portion of which was performed in fiscal  as agreed under a loi signed in march  our backlog can include both funded amounts which are unfilled firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer us congress in the case of us government agencies and unfunded amounts which are unfilled firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated if any of our contracts were to be terminated our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining terms of such contract our backlog was fully funded at april   the amount of contract backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenue because modifications to or terminations of present contracts and production delays can provide additional revenue or reduce anticipated revenue a substantial portion of our revenue has been for the support of our product development efforts these revenues are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method and changes in estimates from time to time may have a significant effect on revenue and backlog our backlog is also typically subject to large variations from time to time due to the timing of new awards going concern our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern we have experienced substantial and recurring losses from operations which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of  million at april   based on the companys cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of april   and including the proceeds received from our may  financing transaction in which we received aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately  million the company believes that it will be able to finance its capital requirements and operations into the quarter ending july   the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended april   contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern based on among other factors that our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional external capital and increase revenues these factors among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to generate revenues become profitable raise additional outside capital or to continue as a going concern if we are not successful in our efforts to raise additional capital sufficient to support our operations we would be forced to cease operations in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our company table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those described below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following accounting policies require significant judgment and estimates by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements legal contingencies as discussed in part i item  of this annual report under the heading legal proceedings and in note  commitments and contingencies in notes to the consolidated financial statements the company is currently subject to various legal proceedings and claims the company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no  accounting for contingencies there is a significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated since the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty in managements opinion any reasonable possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation would not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected revenue recognition and unearned revenues the companys contracts are either cost plus or fixed price contracts under cost plus contracts customers are billed for actual expenses incurred plus an agreedupon fee under cost plus contracts a profit or loss on a project is recognized depending on whether actual costs are more or less than the agreed upon amount the company has two types of fixed price contracts firm fixed price and costsharing under firm fixed price contracts the company receives an agreedupon amount for providing products and services specified in the contract a profit or loss is recognized depending on whether actual costs are more or less than the agreed upon amount under costsharing contracts the fixed amount agreed upon with the customer is only intended to fund a portion of the costs on a specific project under cost sharing contracts an amount corresponding to the revenue is recorded in cost of revenues resulting in gross profit on these contracts of zero the companys share of the costs is recorded as product development expense generally revenue under fixed price or cost plus contracts is recognized using the cost to cost percentageofcompletion method measured by the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion in certain circumstances revenue under contracts that have specified milestones or other performance criteria may be recognized only when the customer acknowledges that such criteria have been satisfied if an arrangement involves multiple deliverables the delivered items are considered separate units of accounting if the items have value on a standalone basis amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services in addition recognition of revenue and the related costs may be deferred for fixed price contracts until contract completion if the company is unable to reasonably estimate the total costs of the project prior to completion these contracts are subject to interpretation and management may make a judgment as to the amount of revenue earned and recorded because the company has a small number of contracts revisions to the percentageofcompletion determination management interpretation or delays in meeting performance and contractual criteria or in completing projects may have a significant effect on revenue for the periods involved upon anticipating a loss on a contract the company recognizes the full amount of the anticipated loss in the current period table of contents unbilled receivables represent expenditures on contracts plus applicable profit margin not yet billed unbilled receivables are normally billed and collected within one year billings made on contracts are recorded as a reduction of unbilled receivables and to the extent that such billings and cash collections exceed costs incurred plus applicable profit margin they are recorded as unearned revenues stockbased compensation costs resulting from all sharebased payment transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at their fair values determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the date of grant using any valuation model requires judgment we may use a monte carlo simulation model for performancebased stock awards if applicable and use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options option pricing models including the blackscholes model require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected term and the expected dividend rate beginning in fiscal  expected volatility for  was based on the companys historical volatility in prior years we estimated our expected volatility based on that of what we considered to be similar publiclytraded companies because our stock had been publicly traded in the us only since april  so we did not have significant observable shareprice volatility for the us capital markets we did not estimate our expected volatility based on the price of our common stock on the aim market of the london stock exchange on which our shares traded from october  until we voluntarily delisted in january  because we did not believe based on the historically low trading volume of our shares on that market that the volatility of our common stock on the aim market was an appropriate indicator of the expected volatility of our common stock we estimate the expected term using the average midpoint between the vesting terms and the contractual terms of our options as permitted by the secs staff accounting bulletin no  sharebased payment if we determine another method to estimate expected term is more reasonable than our current method or if another method for calculating this input assumption is prescribed by authoritative guidance the fair value calculated for future stockbased awards could change significantly longer expected terms have a significant impact on the value of stockbased compensation determined at the date of grant the expected dividend rate is not significant to the calculation of the fair value of our stockbased awards in addition we are required to develop an estimate of the number of stockbased awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements during the quarter of the change if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements these adjustments affect our cost of revenues product development costs and selling general and administrative costs to date the effect of forfeiture adjustments on our consolidated financial statements has been insignificant the expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period andor our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates the aggregate sharebased compensation expense related to all sharebased transactions related to employees was approximately  million and  million in fiscal  and  respectively

 join nowgo»ocean power technologies inc riding a wave thats about to crashjul  about ocean power optt heath white long only value growth at reasonable price mediumterm horizonsummaryocean power technologies makes buoys that harness wave action for power they haven’t actually sold any ocean power technologies is running out of cash with very limited income prospects ocean power technologies is diluting fast insiders are selling ocean power technologies is a strong sell over the last week ocean power technologies inc nasdaqoptt has seen a gigantic surge in stock price and volume from about  on essentially no volume to a high over  on twice the entire float of the stock this euphoria is driven by some announcements that now at long last the company might be in a position to make some money but the stock is already falling back to earth  as i write and it has further to fall optt is a strong sell optt has no commercial product ocean power technologies makes buoys whose purpose is to harness wave power and turn it into electricity its a promising idea but they havent been able to make it commercially viable the company was founded in  and at least since  has never turned a profit until this year the goal was to create a utilityscale network of buoys to feed the grid that line of research has recently been abandoned in favor of making autonomous ie not gridconnected buoys that power things like wildlife tracking devices midocean weather instruments naval submarine detectors and so on these buoys already exist of course but they are powered by solar or batteries ocean power technologies hope is that it can be shown that their products are more efficient or lower maintenance the excitement around the stock centers around the announcement that the company has deployed their new autonomous buoy off the coast of new jersey but this is a testing or proofofconcept deployment it isnt bringing in any money what will bring in some money is licensing this buoy once proven to mitsui energy and shipbuilding a japanese company with more than b in revenue last year there appears to be a month lease signed contingent on the new buoy working as planned beginning march  for k this is of course pocket change for mitsui  they were involved in the utilityintended buoys too and are just continuing their association with ocean power as a flyer that might work someday but this is the only business income on the horizon for ocean power technologies and it wont be soon enough or last them very long optt is running out of cash ocean power technologies had less than m in cash as of their most recent reporting with a burn rate of myear on the last call they were confident that they would make it through the quarter ending in january which is not an enormous vote of confidence so they are taking the only route open to them optt is diluting like mad ocean power technologies raised m in an offering in june and they just announced another offering of unspecified size this has tanked the stock price by about  optt is way overvalued normal valuation metrics mean nothing for a speculative company but anyway ps   pb almost  negative earnings and even negative ebitda as far back as you care to look none of this counts the dilution from the upcoming offering insider selling if my tiny company was on the verge of great things i would hold onto my penny stock or maybe mortgage my house to buy more instead in may founder and ceo george kirby sold  shares at  the stock is over  today conclusion ocean power technologies inc is one of those companies that promises much and never delivers running out of options they pivoted this year to an entirely new business strategy they still have no commercial product and i expect the turnaround to be too little too late the income on the horizon will only doubtfully keep them solvent for a year it will certainly not justify the absurd rampup in the stock price recently which is driven by momentum traders who will be gone as quickly as they arrived optt is a strong sell disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next
