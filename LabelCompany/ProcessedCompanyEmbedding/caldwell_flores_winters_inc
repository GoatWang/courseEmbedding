left their spaces… the students continued to work on their projects until the teacher told them they had to stop working and clean up  tool kits circuit boards protective goggles were spread out on the desks and each desk looked like a workstation in a high tech silicone valley firm…” this was the scene on a recent visit to the bud carson middle school stem academy in hawthorne ca students students engaged in a science project at bud carson middle school stem academy were fully engaged building pinball machines using the integrated course units incorporating geometry math and physics when asked about his project the student said “i’m having fun it doesn’t feel like work”  visiting school district officials from throughout southern california commented on how engaged the students were on their projects and how the middle school classroom mimicked the skills students need in the work place cfw believes that the academic program must drive the facilities program to this end cfw has worked with a number of districts to help them create academy programs academies are not a curriculum a program or a vendor academies are a cultural shift in what a total school is about they promote a philosophy of education and learning  they also serve as a natural vehicle for implementation of the common core state standards and project based learning the curriculum developed is rich rigorous and engaging thus improving student achievement often academy programs are overlooked by a district because they do not have the  facilities andor curriculum and instruction capabilities or the time to  develop such programs it is important for local  schools to improve the academic achievement of their students it is essential for their very survival with the emergence of charter schools and other educational options available to parents  public schools must offer programs that are appealing to the parents of the students that they serve  this is a huge task especially when they also need to improve educational performance one of the ways to both increase academic achievement and appeal to parents is the creation of academies in the educational program for example cfw is working with the oxnard school district to reconfigure the entire district into different grade levels and different academies six k schools with dual language immersion programs  middle schools with academies science and technology academy environmental services and design academy and visual and performing arts academy and eleven k schools with an academic strand focus these academy programs are integrated into the facilities implementation plan along with proposed funding sources our team will work with your district to develop an academy educational program to be integrated within the proposed facilities program with the goal of strengthen academic achievement cfw will take your district from an envisioning process all the way to an  implementation plan we will provide a detailed  timelineschedule of events and project  deliverable’s reflecting the four phases of the development and implementation process the unique feature of our planning process is the integration of the academy program with the facilities and technology program we work with your district’s identified leadership team to ensure successful completion of each of these processes the program that is developed will be one that the district and its community envision desire and own as a secondary outcome of this process your leadership team will receive leadership training that will bring long lasting value    facilities planning k uncategorized  – a year of planning for school districts oxnard ca — for many of our clients  was a pioneering year in the planning and envisioning of school facilities for the oxnard school district in ventura county we developed an innovative nd century approach to classroom design that’s right – learning environments planned designed and built not with a ’s view of the st century but with a view toward the needs and educational demands of students that will eventually live as citizens in a nd century world instead of painted wall surfaces our planners deployed solutions that allow every wall floor to ceiling to be a markeable writable and interactive instructional space plans for harrington elementary  school oxnard ca we researched and replaced  year old solutions like smart boards with new technologies that effectively pair with digital textbooks and will more efficiently equip our teachers and students for the next  years at the la habra city school district in orange county we helped plan and transform local middle schools into academies of the arts and sciences  moreover we reimagined and rediscovered the role of classroom furnishings finding solutions that not only are more effective for maintenance and operations but provide students with ergonomic advantages proven by recent research to have a substantive impact on attention span concentration and creativity – all welcome improvements for implementing the common core and now in los angeles county our planning division has been tasked by the inglewood unified school district to conduct a multilayered facilities analysis that will examine data on school site capacity bond project funding state aid and local mitigation agreements to construct a facilities priority matrix  this innovative visual tool will allow local policymakers to consider various strategic approaches for improving school facilities and planning capital expenditures  plus as an easytounderstand graphic aid the final “heatmap” will boil down the most complex financial and demographic interrelationships into the most fundamental and tangible solutions still many of our clients have not yet had an opportunity to utilize cfw’s team of forwardthinking school planning professionals  your district may be facing its own set of unique planning challenges and our planning division is here to help craft solutions specifically designed to address them  contact jeremy cogan at  to tell us about your facilities and technology planning challenges and we will be happy to share appropriate planning services to meet your needs  facilities planning program management calistoga joint unified celebrates major milestone school officials gather at the ribbon cutting ceremony calistoga calif – the calistoga joint unified school district held a ribbon cutting ceremony at the calistoga juniorsenior high school recently  to celebrate the completion of a major “measure a” project which includes  the construction of a new gym and the student union in addition the  modernization of the library at calistoga elementary  and renewable energy and technology projects throughout the district have been completed this project signals the final use of the measure a funding for the school district cfw inc was the financial advisor planner and full time manager for the implementation of this program measure “a” the district’s  million bond was approved by  of voters on november    measure a projects include   renovation of schools improve school libraries upgrade classrooms modernize computer networks install solar energy systems and replace aging roofs heating electrical plumbing cooling and ventilation systems this project was constructed by blach construction of santa clara ca under a lease leaseback project delivery method lionakis architects of sacramento designed the facility while cfw managed the overall program the project was delivered under budget and within the original contract schedule as promised  financial advisory uncategorized bond market round up interest rates – what to expect good news so far on the interest rate front  interest rates have been declining since yearend and appear to be trending downward in the near term  the cost of issuing bonds is expected to remain flat and therefore a good time to issue bonds in the market  simple supply and demand is partially responsible for this trend over the next month there are approximately  billion of municipal bonds that are maturing and only  billion of new bonds being issued in the market  demand is simply outweighing supply resulting in lower  interest rates  second there are certain income tax increases that will become effective in   this creates further demand for taxexempt bonds as those in the higher tax brackets seek taxfree income they receive from holding municipal bonds while the economy in california appears to continue its upswing the host of national economic indicators including unemployment are still not at desired levels  we can expect our folks in washington to hold tight to current fiscal policies that will keep interest rates as low as possible good news from sacramento– what does it mean for your district governor brown’s budget proposal will have a positive credit effect for schools and community colleges in california  credit rating agencies like moody’s and standard  poor’s will look very favorably on the increase in perpupil funding by  from last year as well as the  increase for california community colleges the state also expects to pay down past state payment deferrals   this combination will equate to a credit positive for all  districts when getting a new credit rating in   and a better credit rating means lower interest rates for your taxpayers private placements – still around in  by all means yes  in speaking with some of the major banks around the state it appears that they are still open for business when it comes to providing a direct purchase of municipal securities which include school bonds their continued profitability helps support their demand for tax free income and their interest in purchasing school bonds  this can be a very good fit for smaller issuers as the “closing costs” of a private placement can be much less than a traditional market transaction  for further information or if you have any questions please call john greenlee at  or jgreenleecfwinccom  campaigns k uncategorized is  a good time to go out for a bond over the last  years caldwell flores winters inc has maintained an impressive  success rate in passing hard to win bond measures last november cfw went  for  in passing a general obligation bond measure a parcel tax measure at twothirds approval and assisted in the reorganization effort of the newly organized wiseburn usd given our experience and expertise in running elections in rural urban and suburban communities we know that every community is unique we have a proven track record in passing bonds both at the twothirds approval level and  because cfw takes a holistic approach in meeting your district’s needs  it’s important to remember that not all voters have daily contact with local schools  parents usually make up less than  of the electorate and many voters simple do not know why good schools will impact them if they do not have kids in school that is why it is important to strategically plan and listen to the needs of all constituents throughout the district and then present a program that voters will accept at the ballot box starting with the end in mind is important in your  planning processes long gone are the days when districts could just call for a bond election and win without facing any public scrutiny  given recent headlines in the news and recent bond reform measures it is critical that district’s plan accordingly before the board takes action to call an election common sense and research will tell you that new facilities do help improve student achievement  however now more than ever we need to be intentional about how the district’s educational planning and common core standards interact with facilities  voters want to know how investments in educational outcomes are linked to facility improvements  this is why we recommend an integrated planning approach to get you from where you are today to where you want to be tomorrow  is now the best time for your district to pursue a bond  let us help guide your discussion with your community stakeholders  for more information contact abel guillen at aguillencfwincom  campaigns facilities planning november  statewide facilities bond measure update cfw has been in close contact with staff at the state allocation board sab and the office of public school construction opsc to track the development of the statewide bond legislation  draft language was reviewed at the january  sab meeting and is targeting final approval of the bond legislation by late march  the january  sab meeting included a public hearing for input on the draft and will be followed by a  day public comment period to obtain additional feedback on the proposed bond program the program appears to offer several benefits to school districts with need the following is a brief overview of the more critical recommendations  all school districts should be required to reestablish their new construction eligibility baseline in order to be eligible to receive funding under the new bond districts would be required to provide current information to opsc confirming classroom inventory it is likely that districts will be unable to claim additional dwelling units based on tract maps which have yet to obtain development approvals   new construction grants may not be used for the purpose of constructing portable classrooms districts will now be prohibited from utilizing new construction grants to construct portable school facilities previously districts were able to use state funds to construct portable facilities with only a yr expected life which created a drain on modernization and deferred maintenance funds at the state  all school districts should be required to reestablish their modernization eligibility baseline at each site in order to be eligible to receive funding under a new bond under the previous program the modernization eligibility was not required to be updated periodically and in many cases eligibility numbers on file were more than ten years old and likely to be inaccurate districts in the state will now be required to update all their classroom eligibility prior to being eligible for modernization funds  the use of modernization grants should be limited to permanent facilities projects this recommendation requires that all modernization monies be used to modernize permanent facilities or to build new facilities funds could still be used to build new structures or to modernize existing permanent facilities  consider changing the criteria for the financial hardship program by increasing the bond indebtedness level from  to  the district’s eligibility for the hardship program in the past was linked to their having issued debt that met or exceeded  of the “assessed valuation” of all real property within the district boundaries districts would now be required to have issued debt in excess of  of the assessed valuation in order to qualify as these legislative efforts continue to develop cfw will provide regular reports to our clients regarding the status of the initiative and how the new program will impact your local district for more information contact greg norman at gnormancfwinccom      facilities planning financial advisory k program
