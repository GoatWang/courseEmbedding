fmr stresses maintaining a stable  share price liquidit y and income description of principal security types money market securities are highquality shortterm securities that pay a fixed variable  or floating interest rate securities are often specifically structured so that they are eligible investments for a money market fund for example in order to satisfy the maturity restrictions for a money market fund some money market securities have demand or put features  which have the effect of shortening the securitys maturity  money market securities include bank certificates of deposit bank acceptances bank time deposits notes commercial pape r and us government securities us government securities are highquality securities issued or guaranteed by the us treasury or by an agency or instrumentality of the us government us government securities may be backed by the full faith and credit of the us treasury the right to borrow from the us treasury or the agency or instrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the security a repurchase agreement is an agreement to buy a security at one price and a simultaneous agreement to sell it back at an agreedupon price principal investment risks many factors affect each funds performance a funds yield will change daily based on changes in interest rates and other market conditions although each fund is managed to maintain a stable  share price there is no guarantee that the fund will be able to do so for example a major increase in interest rates or a decrease in the credit quality of the issuer of one of a funds investments could cause the funds share price to decrease while the funds will be charged premiums by a mutual insurance company for coverage of specified types of losses related to default or bankruptcy on certain securities a fund may incur losses regardless of the insurance it is important to note that neither the fund s  share prices nor their yields are guaranteed by the us government the following factors can significantly affect a funds performance interest rate changes money market securities have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in interest rates in general the price of a money market security can fall when interest rates rise and can rise when interest rates fall securities with longer maturities and the securities of issuers in the financial services sector can be more sensitive to interest rate changes shortterm securities tend to react to changes in shortterm interest rates foreign exposure issuers located in foreign countries and entities located in foreign countries that provide credit support or a maturityshortening structure can involve increased risks extensive public information about the issuer or provider may not be available and unfavorable political economic  or governmental developments could affect the value of the security financial services exposure financial services companies are highly dependent on the supply of shortterm financing the value of securities of issuers in the financial services sector can be sensitive to changes in government regulation and interest rates and to economic downturns in the united states and abroad issuerspecific changes changes in the financial condition of an issuer changes in specific economic or political conditions that affect a particular type of issuer and changes in general economic or political conditions can affect the credit quality or value of an issuers securities entities providing credit support or a maturityshortening structure also can be affected by these types of changes if the structure of a security fails to function as intended the security could decline in value fundamental investment policies the policies discussed below are fundamental that is subject

market insurance each fund participates in a mutual insurance company solely with other funds advised by fmr or its affiliates this company provides insurance coverage for losses on certain money market instruments held by a participating fund eligible instruments including losses from nonpayment of principal or interest or a bankruptcy or insolvency of the issuer or credit support provider if any the insurance does not cover losses resulting from changes in interest rates or other market developments each fund is charged an annual premium for the insurance coverage and may be subject to a special assessment of up to approximately two and onehalf times the funds annual gross premium if covered losses exceed certain levels a participating fund may recover no more than  million annually including all other claims of insured funds and may only recover if the amount of the loss exceeds  of its eligible instruments each fund may incur losses regardless of the insurance money market securities are highquality shortterm obligations money market securities may be structured to be or may employ a trust or other form so that they are eligible investments for money market funds for example put features can be used to modify the maturity of a security or interest rate adjustment features can be used to enhance price stability if a structure fails to function as intended adverse tax or investment consequences may result neither the internal revenue service irs nor any other regulatory authority has ruled definitively on certain legal issues presented by certain structured

municipal securities or the rights of municipal securities holders a municipal security may be owned directly or through a participation interest put features entitle the holder to sell a security

the put provider is unable to honor the put feature purchase the security put providers often support their ability to buy securities on demand by obtaining letters of credit or other guarantees from other entities demand features standby commitments and tender options are types of put features repurchase agreements involve an agreement to purchase a security and to sell that security back to the original seller at an agreedupon price the resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreedupon incremental amount which is unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased security as protection against the risk that the original seller will not fulfill its obligation the securities are held in a separate account at a bank markedtomarket daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the sale price plus the accrued incremental amount the value of the security purchased may be more or less than the price at which the counterparty has agreed to purchase the security in addition delays or losses could result if the other party to the agreement defaults or becomes insolvent the funds will engage in repurchase agreement transactions with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by fmr restricted securities are subject to legal restrictions on their sale difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or be costly to a fund restricted securities generally can be sold in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of  or in a registered public offering where registration is required the holder of a registered security may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expense and a considerable period may elapse between the time it decides to seek registration and the time it may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement if during such a period adverse market conditions were to develop the holder might obtain a less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to seek registration of the security reverse repurchase agreements in a reverse repurchase agreement a fund sells a security to another party such as a bank or brokerdealer in return for cash and agrees to repurchase that security at an agreedupon price and time the funds will enter into reverse repurchase agreements with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by fmr such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and a funds yield and may be viewed as a form of leverage short sales against the box are short sales of securities that a fund owns or has the right to obtain equivalent in kind or amount to the securities sold short short sales against the box could be used to protect the net asset value per share nav of the fund in anticipation of increased interest rates without sacrificing the current yield of the securities sold short if a fund enters into a short sale against the box it will be required to set aside securities equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short or securities convertible or exchangeable into such securities and will be required to hold such securities while the short sale is outstanding the fund will incur transaction costs in connection with opening and closing short sales against the box sources of liquidity or credit support issuers may employ various forms of credit and liquidity enhancements including letters of credit guarantees puts and demand features and insurance provided by domestic or foreign entities such as banks and other financial institutions fmr may rely on its evaluation of the credit of the liquidity or credit enhancement provider in determining whether to purchase a security supported by such enhancement in evaluating the credit of a foreign bank or other foreign entities fmr will consider whether adequate public information about the entity is available and whether the entity may be subject to unfavorable political or economic developments currency controls or other government restrictions that might affect its ability to honor its commitment changes in the credit quality of the entity providing the enhancement could affect the value of the security or a funds share price stripped securities are the separate income or principal components of a debt security the risks associated with stripped securities are similar to those of other money market securities although stripped securities may be more volatile us treasury securities that have been stripped by a federal reserve bank are obligations issued by the us treasury privately stripped government securities are created when a dealer deposits a us treasury security or other us government security with a custodian for safekeeping the custodian issues separate receipts for the coupon payments and the principal payment which the dealer then sells because the sec does not consider privately stripped government securities to be us government securities for purposes of rule a a fund must evaluate them as it would nongovernment securities pursuant to regulatory guidelines applicable to money market funds variable and floating rate securities provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate paid on the security variable rate securities provide for a specified periodic adjustment in the interest rate while floating rate securities have interest rates that change whenever there is a change in a designated benchmark rate some variable or floating rate securities are structured with put features that permit holders to demand payment of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest from the issuers or certain financial intermediaries whenissued and forward purchase or sale transactions involve a commitment to purchase or sell specific securities at a predetermined price or yield in which payment and delivery take place after the customary settlement period for that type of security typically no interest accrues to the purchaser until the security is delivered when purchasing securities pursuant to one of these transactions the purchaser assumes the rights and risks of ownership including the risks of price and yield fluctuations and the risk that the security will not be issued as anticipated because payment for the securities is not required until the delivery date these risks are in addition to the risks associated with a funds investments if a fund remains substantially fully invested at a time when a purchase is outstanding the purchases may result in a form of leverage when a fund has sold a security pursuant to one of these transactions the fund does not participate in further gains or losses with respect to the security if the other party to a delayeddelivery transaction fails to deliver or pay for the securities a fund could miss a favorable price or yield opportunity or suffer a loss a fund may renegotiate a whenissued or forward transaction and may sell the underlying securities before delivery which may result in capital gains or losses for the fund portfolio transactions all orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are placed on behalf of each fund by fmr pursuant to authority contained in the management contract fmr is also responsible for the placement of transaction orders for other investment companies and investment accounts for which it or its affiliates act as investment adviser in selecting brokerdealers subject to applicable limitations of the federal securities laws fmr considers various relevant factors including but not limited to the size and type of the transaction the nature and character of the markets for the security to be purchased or sold the execution efficiency settlement capability and financial condition of the brokerdealer firm the brokerdealers execution services rendered on a continuing basis the reasonableness of any commissions and if applicable arrangements for payment of fund expenses if fmr grants investment management authority to a subadviser see the section entitled management contracts that subadviser is authorized to place orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities and will do so in accordance with the policies described above each fund may execute portfolio transactions with brokerdealers who provide research and execution services to the fund or other investment accounts over which fmr or its affiliates exercise investment discretion such services may include advice concerning the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities and the availability of securities or the purchasers or sellers of securities in addition such brokerdealers may furnish analyses and reports concerning issuers industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and performance of investment accounts and effect securities transactions and perform functions incidental thereto such as clearance and settlement for transactions in fixedincome securities fmrs selection of brokerdealers is generally based on the availability of a security and its price and to a lesser extent on the overall quality of execution and other services including research provided by the brokerdealer the receipt of research from brokerdealers that execute transactions on behalf of a fund may be useful to fmr in rendering investment management services to that fund or its other clients and conversely such research provided by brokerdealers who have executed transaction orders on behalf of other fmr clients may be useful to fmr in carrying out its obligations to a fund the receipt of such research has not reduced fmrs normal independent research activities however it enables fmr to avoid the additional expenses that could be incurred if fmr tried to develop comparable information through its own efforts fixedincome securities are generally purchased from an issuer or underwriter acting as principal for the securities on a net basis with no brokerage commission paid however the dealer is compensated by a difference between the securitys original purchase price and the selling price the socalled bidasked spread securities may also be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting fees subject to applicable limitations of the federal securities laws a fund may pay a brokerdealer commissions for agency transactions that are in excess of the amount of commissions charged by other brokerdealers in recognition of their research and execution services in order to cause a fund to pay such higher commissions fmr must determine in good faith that such commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such executing brokerdealers viewed in terms of a particular transaction or fmrs overall responsibilities to that fund or its other clients in reaching this determination fmr will not attempt to place a specific dollar value on the brokerage and research services provided or to determine what portion of the compensation should be related to those services to the extent permitted by applicable law fmr is authorized to allocate portfolio transactions in a manner that takes into account assistance received in the distribution of shares of the funds or other fidelity funds and to use the research services of brokerage and other firms that have provided such assistance fmr may use research services provided by and place agency transactions with national financial services corporation nfsc and fidelity brokerage services japan llc fbsj indirect subsidiaries of fmr corp if the commissions are fair reasonable and comparable to commissions charged by nonaffiliated qualified brokerage firms for similar services prior to december   fmr used research services provided by and placed agency transactions with fidelity brokerage services fbs an indirect subsidiary of fmr corp fmr may allocate brokerage transactions to brokerdealers including affiliates of fmr who have entered into arrangements with fmr under which the brokerdealer allocates a portion of the commissions paid by a fund toward the reduction of that funds expenses the transaction quality must however be comparable to those of other qualified brokerdealers section a of the securities exchange act of  prohibits members of national securities exchanges from executing exchange transactions for investment accounts which they or their affiliates manage unless certain requirements are satisfied pursuant to such requirements the board of trustees has authorized nfsc to execute portfolio transactions on national securities exchanges in accordance with approved procedures and applicable sec rules the trustees of each fund periodically review fmrs performance of its responsibilities in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions on behalf of the fund and review the commissions paid by the fund over representative periods of time to determine if they are reasonable in relation to the benefits to the fund for the fiscal years ended november      and  the funds paid no brokerage commissions for the fiscal year ended november     the funds paid no brokerage commissions to firms that provided research services the trustees of each fund have approved procedures in conformity with rule f under the  act whereby a fund may purchase securities that are offered in underwritings in which an affiliate of fmr participates these procedures prohibit the funds from directly or indirectly benefiting an fmr affiliate in connection with such underwritings in addition for underwritings where an fmr affiliate participates as a principal underwriter certain restrictions may apply that could among other things limit the amount of securities that the funds could purchase in the underwriting from time to time the trustees will review whether the recapture for the benefit of the funds of some portion of the brokerage commissions or similar fees paid by the funds on portfolio transactions is legally permissible and advisable each fund seeks to recapture soliciting brokerdealer fees on the tender of portfolio securities but at present no other recapture arrangements are in effect the trustees intend to continue to review whether recapture opportunities are available and are legally permissible and if so to determine in the exercise of their business judgment whether it would be advisable for each fund to seek such recapture although the trustees and officers of each fund are substantially the same as those of other funds managed by fmr or its affiliates investment decisions for each fund are made independently from those of other funds managed by fmr or investment accounts managed by fmr affiliates it sometimes happens that the same security is held in the portfolio of more than one of these funds or investment accounts simultaneous transactions are inevitable when several funds and investment accounts are managed by the same investment adviser particularly when the same security is suitable for the investment objective of more than one fund or investment account when two or more funds are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of the same security the prices and amounts are allocated in accordance with procedures believed to be appropriate and equitable for each fund in some cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or value of the security as far as each fund is concerned in other cases however the ability of the funds to participate in volume transactions will produce better executions and prices for the funds it is the current opinion of the trustees that the desirability of retaining fmr as investment adviser to each fund outweighs any disadvantages that may be said to exist from exposure to simultaneous transactions valuation each funds nav is the value of a single share the nav of each fund is computed by adding the value of the funds investments cash and other assets subtracting its liabilities and dividing the result by the number of shares outstanding portfolio securities and other assets are valued on the basis of amortized cost this technique involves initially valuing an instrument at its cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount rather than its current market value the amortized cost value of an instrument may be higher or lower than the price a fund would receive if it sold the instrument securities of other openend investment companies are valued at their respective navs at such intervals as they deem appropriate the trustees consider the extent to which nav calculated by using market valuations would deviate from the  per share calculated using amortized cost valuation if the trustees believe that a deviation from a funds amortized cost per share may result in material dilution or other unfair results to shareholders the trustees have agreed to take such corrective action if any as they deem appropriate to eliminate or reduce to the extent reasonably practicable the dilution or unfair results such corrective action could include selling portfolio instruments prior to maturity to realize capital gains or losses or to shorten average portfolio maturity withholding dividends redeeming shares in kind establishing nav by using available market quotations and such other measures as the trustees may deem appropriate performance a fund may quote performance in various ways all performance information supplied by the funds in advertising is historical and is not intended to indicate future returns each funds yield and return fluctuate in response to market conditions and other factors yield calculations to compute the yield for a fund for a period the net change in value of a hypothetical account containing one share reflects the value of additional shares purchased with dividends from the one original share and dividends declared on both the original share and any additional shares the net change is then divided by the value of the account at the beginning of the period to obtain a base period return this base period return is annualized to obtain a current annualized yield a fund also may calculate an effective yield by compounding the base period return over a oneyear period in addition to the current yield a fund may quote yields in advertising based on any historical sevenday period yields for a fund are calculated on the same basis as other money market funds as required by applicable regulation yield information may be useful in reviewing a funds performance and in providing a basis for comparison with other investment alternatives however a funds yield fluctuates unlike investments that pay a fixed interest rate over a stated period of time when comparing investment alternatives investors should also note the quality and maturity of the portfolio securities of respective investment companies they have chosen to consider investors should recognize that in periods of declining interest rates a funds yield will tend to be somewhat higher than prevailing market rates and in periods of rising interest rates a funds yield will tend to be somewhat lower also when interest rates are falling the inflow of net new money to a fund from the continuous sale of its shares will likely be invested in instruments producing lower yields than the balance of the funds holdings thereby reducing a funds current yield in periods of rising interest rates the opposite can be expected to occur return calculations returns quoted in advertising reflect all aspects of a funds return including the effect of reinvesting divi dends and capital gain distributions and any change in a funds nav over a stated period a cumulative return reflects actual performance over a stated period of time average annual returns are calculated by determining the growth or decline in value of a hypothetical historical investment in a fund over a stated period and then calculating the annually compounded percentage rate that would have produced the same result if the rate of growth or decline in value had been constant over the period for example a cumulative r eturn of  over ten years would produce an average annual return of  which is the steady annual rate of return that would equal  growth on a compounded basis in ten years while average annual returns are a convenient means of comparing investment alternatives investors should realize that a funds performance is not constant over time but changes from year to year and that average annual returns represent averaged figures as opposed to the actual yeartoyear performance of a fund in addition to average annual returns a fund may quote unaveraged or cumulative returns reflecting the simple change in value of an investment over a stated period average annual and cumulative returns may be quoted as a percentage or as a dollar amount and may be calculated for a single investment a series of investments or a series of redemptions over any time period returns may be broken down into their components of income and capital including capital gains and changes in share price in order to illustrate the relationship of these factors and their contributions to return returns may be quoted on a beforetax or aftertax basis returns may or may not include the effect of a funds small account fee excluding a funds small account fee from a return calculation produces a higher return figure returns yields and other performance information may be quoted numerically or in a table graph or similar illustration historical

performance may be compared to the performance of other mutual funds in general or to the performance of particular types of mutual funds these comparisons may be expressed as mutual fund rankings prepared by lipper inc lipper an independent service located in summit new jersey that monitors the performance of mutual funds generally lipper rankings are based on return assume reinvestment of distributions do not take sales charges or trading fees into consideration and are prepared without regard to tax consequences lipper may also rank based on yield in addition to the mutual fund rankings a funds performance may be compared to stock bond and money market mutual fund performance indexes prepared by lipper or other organizations when comparing these indexes it is important to remember the risk and return characteristics of each type of investment for example while stock mutual funds may offer higher potential returns they also carry the highest degree of share price volatility likewise money market funds may offer greater stability of principal but generally do not offer the higher potential returns available from stock mutual funds from time to time a funds performance may also be compared to other mutual funds tracked by financial or business publications and periodicals for example a fund may quote morningstar inc in its advertising materials morningstar inc is a mutual fund rating service that rates mutual funds on the basis of riskadjusted performance rankings that compare the performance of fidelity funds to one another in appropriate categories over specific periods of time may also be quoted in advertising a fund may be compared in advertising to certificates of deposit cds or other investments issued by banks or other depository institutions mutual funds differ from bank investments in several respects for example a fund may offer greater liquidity or higher potential returns than cds a fund does not guarantee your principal or your return and fund shares are not fdic insured fidelity may provide information designed to help individuals understand their investment goals and explore various financial strategies such

redemption information for select cash reserves account shareholders a deferred sales charge of  of the redemption amount will be deducted when you redeem shares purchased prior to october   the deferred sales charge does not apply to exchanges to the select portfolios a fund may make redemption payments in whole or in part in readily marketable securities or other property valued for this purpose as they are valued in computing each funds nav  if fmr determines it is in the best interests of the fund shareholders that receive securities or other property on redemption may realize a gain or loss for tax purposes and will incur any costs of sale as well as the associated inconveniences distributions and taxes dividends because each funds income is primarily derived from interest dividends from the fund generally will not qualify for the dividendsreceived deduction available to corporate shareholders shortterm capital gains are taxable as dividends but do not qualify for the dividendsreceived deduction capital gain distributions each fund may distribute any net realized capital gains once a year or more often as necessary as of november     cash reserves had a capital loss carryforward aggregating approximately   this loss carryforward of which       and   will expire on november      and   respectively is available to offset future capital gains state and local tax issues for mutual funds organized as business trusts state law provides for a passthrough of the state and local income tax exemption afforded to direct owners of us government securities some states limit this passthrough to mutual funds that invest a certain amount in us government securities and some types of securities such as repurchase agreements and some agencybacked securities may not qualify for this benefit the tax treatment of your dividends from a fund will be the same as if you directly owned a proportionate share of the us government securities because the income earned on certain us government securities is exempt from state and local personal income taxes the portion of dividends from a fund attributable to these securities will also be free from state and local personal income taxes the exemption from state and local personal income taxation does not preclude states from assessing other taxes on the ownership of us government securities tax status of the

purchasers for shares of the fund which are continuously offered at nav promotional and administrative expenses in connection with the offer and sale of shares are paid by fmr the trustees have approved distribution and service plans on behalf of each fund the plans pursuant to rule b under the  act the rule the rule provides in substance that a mutual fund may not engage directly or indirectly in financing any activity that is primarily intended to result in the sale of shares of the fund except pursuant to a plan approved on behalf of the fund under the rule the plans as approved by the trustees allow the funds and fmr to incur certain expenses that might be considered to constitute indirect payment by the funds of distribution expenses under each plan if the payment of management fees by the fund to fmr is deemed to be indirect financing by the fund of the distribution of its shares such payment is authorized by the plan each plan specifically recognizes that fmr may use its management fee revenue as well as its past profits or its other resources to pay fdc for expenses incurred in connection with providing services intended to result in the sale of fund shares andor shareholder support services in addition each plan provides that fmr directly or through fdc may pay intermediaries such as banks brokerdealers and other serviceproviders that provide those services currently the board of trustees has authorized such payments for cash reserves and us government reserves shares prior to approving each plan the trustees carefully considered all pertinent factors relating to the implementation of the plan and determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that the plan will benefit the fund and its shareholders in particular the trustees noted that each plan does not authorize payments by the fund other than those made to fmr under its management contract with the fund to the extent that each plan gives fmr and fdc greater flexibility in connection with the distribution of fund shares additional sales of fund shares or stabilization of cash flows may result furthermore certain shareholder support services may be provided more effectively under the plans by local entities with whom shareholders have other relationships the glasssteagall act generally prohibits federally and state chartered or supervised banks from engaging in the business of underwriting selling or distributing securities although the scope of this prohibition under the glasssteagall act has not been clearly defined by the courts or appropriate regulatory agencies fdc believes that the glasssteagall act should not preclude a bank from performing shareholder support services or servicing and recordkeeping functions fdc intends to engage banks only to perform such functions however changes in federal or state statutes and regulations pertaining to the permissible activities of banks and their affiliates or subsidiaries as well as further judicial or administrative decisions or interpretations could prevent a bank from continuing to perform all or a part of the contemplated services if a bank were prohibited from so acting the trustees would consider what actions if any would be necessary to continue to provide efficient and effective shareholder services in such event changes in the operation of the funds might occur including possible termination of any automatic investment or redemption or other services then provided by the bank it is not expected that shareholders would suffer any adverse financial consequences as a result of any of these occurrences in addition state securities laws on this issue may differ from the interpretations of federal law expressed herein and banks and other financial institutions may be required to register as dealers pursuant to state law each fund may execute portfolio transactions with and purchase securities issued by depository institutions that receive payments under the plans no preference for the instruments of such depository institutions will be shown in the selection of investments fdc may compensate intermediaries that satisfy certain criteria established from time to time by fdc relating to the level or type of services provided by the intermediary the sale or expected sale of significant amounts of shares or other factors transfer and service agent agreements

reserves are funds of fidelity phillips street trust an openend management investment company organized as a delaware business trust on september   currently there are two funds in fidelity phillips street trust fidelity cash reserves and fidelity u s government reserves the trustees are permitted to create additional funds in the trust the assets of the trust received for the issue or sale of shares of each fund and all income earnings profits and proceeds thereof subject to the rights of creditors are allocated to such fund and constitute the underlying assets of such fund the underlying assets of each fund in the trust shall be charged with the liabilities and expenses attributable to such fund any general expenses of the trust shall be allocated between or among any one or more of the funds shareholder liability the trust is a business trust organized under delaware law delaware law provides that shareholders shall be entitled to the same limitations of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit the courts of some states however may decline to apply delaware law on this point the trust instrument contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for the debts liabilities obligations and expenses of the trust the trust instrument provides that the trust shall not have any claim against shareholders except for the payment of the purchase price of shares and requires that each agreement obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the trust or the trustees relating to the trust or to a fund shall include a provision limiting the obligations created thereby to the trust or to one or more funds and its or their assets the trust instrument further provides that shareholders of a fund shall not have a claim on or right to any assets belonging to any other fund the trust instrument provides for indemnification out of each funds property of any shareholder or former shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the fund solely by reason of his or her being or having been a shareholder and not because of his or her acts or omissions or for some other reason the trust instrument also provides that each fund shall upon request assume the defense of any claim made against any shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund and satisfy any judgment thereon thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which delaware law does not apply no contractual limitation of liability was in effect and a fund is unable to meet its obligations fmr believes that in view of the above the risk of personal liability to shareholders is extremely remote voting rights each funds capital consists of shares of beneficial interest as a shareholder you are entitled to one vote for each dollar of net asset value you own the voting rights of shareholders can be changed only by a shareholder vote shares may be voted in the aggregate by fund and by class the shares have no preemptive or conversion rights shares are fully paid and nonassessable except as set forth under the heading shareholder liability above the trust or any of its funds may be terminated upon the sale of its assets to another openend management investment company or series thereof or upon liquidation and distribution of its assets generally such terminations must be approved by a vote of shareholders in the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the trust shareholders of each of its funds are entitled to receive the underlying assets of such fund available for distribution in the event of the dissolution or liquidation of a fund shareholders of that fund are entitled to receive the underlying assets of the fund available for distribution under the trust instrument the trustees may without shareholder vote in order to change the form of organization of the trust cause the trust to merge or consolidate with one or more trusts partnerships associations limited liability companies or corporations as long as the surviving entity is an openend management investment company or is a fund thereof that will
