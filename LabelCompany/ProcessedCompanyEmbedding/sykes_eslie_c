working capital efficiency this resulted in a net debt reduction of  million or  weve delivered a reduction for  consecutive quarters free cash flow increase of  million or  a net inventory decrease of  million or  and a reduction of working capital or  million or  now working capital efficiency improved and as a percent of revenue it decreased from  to read morethe second part of the plan was to integrate the disparate north american commercial services sales and operations group our plan for integration on many of those disruptive activities are completethe third part of the plan was to create an enterprise management system our integrated management system is maturing inaudible managements insight and control of our business with better inaudible analysis metrics and timely reporting its hard for me to overstate the importance of the system and the difference it will make as we consolidate our operating structure the information that we see about both our business and our clients enables our decisionmaking in ways that were simply not available under the old structure the implementation of the new usbased erp system will be a major milestone in improving the tools for management continuous improvement of our management system will be a primary focus of our teams in the futurethe fourth part of the plan was to simplify and consolidate our operating and legal structure so we decreased a number of entities in north american services from  to  in fy  and we now have line of sight operating north american services group primarily with  legal entities one for commercial and one for federal we consolidated  erp systems which reduces the risk and complexity and improves managements information in addition the initiative to consolidate the remaining erp systems will simplify and standardize processes reduce our overhead cost leverage our industry best practices and improve client service in north american services this phase of initiative will reduce the number of unique systems from  to  it will also create a scalable platform to enable us to be more responsive to the evolving needs of our broad client base that we serve globally we entered into a year credit agreement with a strong set of financial partners the terms of the agreement recognize the reorganizational cost to be incurred through q fy  which provided us with the flexibility necessary to restructure the business and we consolidated  we started consolidation of our european financial operations into a single erp system and established a new centralized product warehouse in the netherlands for our european operations this is improving our cost structure and simplified how we manage the businessthe fifth part of the plan was to build a management team who could help lead black box through the transformation im pleased with the addition of our leadership in sales strategic partnerships and most recently our new cfo im happy to welcome to our team tim delisle our new vice president of sales and dave russo our new cfo tim and dave join a team that is very focused on successful transformationin fiscal  this was the year to set the foundation for sustained growth while this was occurring there were some substantial revenue growth initiatives accomplished during fy  including the renewed longterm contracts with key clients including our large financial service client and added new clients with business outcomefocused selling we created new offerings or expanded our markets and better aligned our black box with our client digital strategies including the customized kvm solution mentioned last quarter now this enabled by  was enabled by our acquisition late in fiscal  of cloudium systems a software development team in ireland the integration of cloudium strengthens our leadership position in the highperformance kvm in kvm over ip marketplace that team will allow us to remain a leader in highperformance kvm solutions we realigned our nacs sales approach to a marketfocused solutions and team selling we already have relationships with toptier clients in over  markets now this sales approach leverages our strong market position we initiated a program to transition our product sales channel in the us to exclusively distribution we merged our disparate clientfacing customer solution centers to create an integrated client experience center to ensure its clients have one consistent means to receive remote support in this back service system black box regardless of the market we launched this strategy initiative with a toptier consulting firm to expand the business in the markets with longterm sustained growth now ill talk more about that progress on this initiative later in the call and im pleased with these accomplishments and the foundation that weve established for the companys futurelooking briefly at results q revenue was consistent with our internal expectations and adjusted operating income was slightly above our expectations last quarter i stated that the strategy consultant and erp implementation would add  million to  million to our operating expenses in the fourth quarter due to timing these expenses came in lower than anticipated in q as some of those costs will flow through in the first quarter we generated over  million in free cash flow in the quarter returning  million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks the remaining cash was used to pay down debt net debt is at a year low of  million as noted in our earnings release our board of directors has authorized the payment of a dividend of  per share this quarter including this distribution black box has paid a dividend for  consecutive quarterslooking forward we expect our revenue in q to be slightly down from q  were making good progress in positioning the company for growth and its too early for the actions taken to flow through strong enough to offset the legacy challenges of our ucc revenue and certain product line revenue streams sequentially we expect north american commercial services revenue to be about flat the federal business to continue to be up and the product business to decline we expect operating expenses to be up above the normalized run rate in q due to the following investments in longterm growth which are implementing a new usbased erp system consolidating the erp operations investment in product development and our engagement with the consulting group working on our services growth strategy these projects remain on schedule all these investments are to strengthen the companys future performance and dave will speak to our opex run shortlyas we move into fy  much of the foundation work of our transformation has been initiated or is complete we will continue to simplify our business model and make improvements in our operating metrics however more of our attention is turning to revenue growth as we rotate in the markets with stronger growth potential we recognize that theres no several bullet or quick fix for changing the trajectory of our business and we are thoughtfully making the necessary changes to build a fundamentally stronger companyi look forward to sharing more insights into our growth initiatives after the financial update from davedavid j russo black box corporation  cfo svp and treasurer thank you ec we posted fourth quarter revenue of  million down from  million last quarter due to a decrease in service revenues partially offset by an increase in product revenues products revenue was  million up  million or  from  million last quarter due to a large solution order in europe partially offset by a lower demand for certain legacy data networking products services revenue was  million down  million or  from  million last quarter mostly due to a decrease in commercial revenues in north america services as a result of lower demand for uccrelated projects partially offset by relatively stable infrastructure activity and an increase in federal revenues as a result of higher volume of project awardsconsolidated fiscal  revenue was  million down from  million last year due to a decrease in both services and products revenues quarterly maintenance revenue which is derived primarily from longterm agreements with ucc services clients was  million or  of our revenue for the fourth quarter this is consistent with last quarter and it was also down  from  million or  of our revenues in fiscal annual maintenance revenue was  million or  of revenue this is down  from  million or  of revenues last year this maintenance revenue trend is consistent with market trends and is only one of the markets we servemonth order backlog which consists of confirmed orders that we expect to revenue in the next  days is  million down  million from  million last quarter and down  million from  million in the same period last year total backlog at the end of the year was  million compared to  million last year both the sequential quarter and yearoveryear declines are primarily due to a depletion of federal services backlog as a result of timing for new contract awards and commercial services as a result of lower demand for uccrelated projects this activity reduction is all within our north america services businessgross margin for the quarter was  down from  last quarter due to a decrease in both products and services gross margin products gross margin was  down from  last quarter primarily due to a less favorable mix partially offset by positive results of cost reduction programs executed over the last year services gross margin was  down from  last quarter primarily due to lower profits on project mix as well as some cost overruns on certain projects gross margin for the fiscal year was  down from  last year primarily due to an increase in inventory impairment losses over the prior year in both services and product as well as project mix related to services revenuesga for the quarter was  million down  million or  from  million last quarter the reasons for the quartertoquarter change are highlighted in the presented waterfall chart and are as follows during the fourth quarter we had decreases of  million for incentive compensation  million of restructuring expense and  in other compensationrelated expenses these reductions were partially offset by additional investments including  for consolidation of our internal support organization which includes a new erp rollout and consolidation of backoffice functions and  million of strategic consulting and the usbased erp projectsga for the fiscal year was  million down  million or  from  million last year the reasons for the yeartoyear change are also highlighted in the year waterfall and are as follows during fy we had decreases of  million in compensation related expense  million in legacy consulting expenses related to the sales and operational transformation  million in restructuring a  million reduction in accounts receivable reserve adjustments related to a specific contract  million of facility related expenses which includes a  thousand gain due to a facility sale and  million travelrelated expenses as we tightened up cost controls these reductions in spending were offset by additional investments of  on the integration of the internal  im sorry the international support organization and  million for the strategy consulting and the new usbased erp project in addition we had a  million   million increase in incentive compensation expensethinking about the first quarter of fiscal  we expect a normalized sga expense run rate of between  million to  million excluding costs associated with future restructuring and the usbased erp projectadjusted operating income margin for the quarter was  down from  last quarter adjusted operating income margin for the year was  compared to  last yearoperating earnings per share were  down  from  last quarter operating earnings per share for the year was  down  from  last yearthe operational income tax rate for the quarter and year was  the gaap effective income tax rate for the quarter was negative  due to the mix of business income where we

cash for debt reduction dividend payments and share repurchasesour leverage ratio is  down from  in the prior quarter and  in the same period last year our current incremental borrowing rate is as discussed on previous calls we remain focused on working capital management during the fiscal year we reduced working capital as a percentage of revenues from  to  our expectation for fiscal  is in the range of  to  we will continue to prioritize the use of capital towards our strategic initiatives and we expect to use our first quarter available cash flow for investment in the usbased erp project dividends and debt reductioni will now turn the call back to eceslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director great thanks dave last quarter i discussed our vision for black box we intended to be the trusted digital partner and our goals are to provide bestinclass products and services enable digital convergence of disparate platforms and to create innovative solutions through expanded strategic partnerships this quarter id like to provide some additional thoughts on our future directionleading companies know that their digital strategies enable agility innovation and enhanced customer experience ultimately it allows them to be more informed and responsive to their customers needs its a compressive challenge and requires a convergence of devices processes it systems and application it is also very dynamic itenabled market forces require companies to invest in their digital strategies to provide the environment demanded by their clients it creates efficiency in their supply chains and empowers their employees this is a continuous evolutionary process that is driving companies to invest into their digital platforms i see three main components of the digital ecosystem we operate in data centers which include private public and hybrid clouds the edge where devices are connected to the network and interact with the world and the pipe which moves data between the twonow we have a solution in all  areas and our strongest position by far is enabling edge our value proposition has always included the ability to connect and integrate a wide range of devices to the network both wired and wireless the edge is where people devices and data converge to allow businesses to make better faster and more informed decisions this convergence is enabled by infrastructure networks and systems moving and enabling the exchange of information wherever and whenever the business or the customers need it the complexity of the edge is increasing due to the rapid growth of the number of connected devices both fixed and mobile with some forecasts at  million devices added per hour and  billion devices installed by  adding devices increases risk and expanded demand for security bandwidth and latency solutionsto address the increasing complexity the network architecture is changing moving some of the application and computing power from the data center to the digital edge this shift increases intelligence at the edge where our clients and their customers operate the combination of the rapid increase in devices and the movement of intelligence to the edge will be the next strong growth area of the physical and logical network this represents a large opportunity for black box the expertise required to enable this transition is well aligned with our capabilities and our global footprint black box is known for our globally distributed technical team already experienced in deploying devices at the edge we will focus our efforts on this market and clarify our capabilities to enable this transitionto establish our identity as a leading edge solution provider we will leverage our experience in designing deploying and managing highperformance networks for some of the worlds largest institutions we will expand our services and connecting wired and wireless iot devices and designing the systems we invest in those markets identified in our growth strategy we will leverage our team of over  globally deployed skilled technicians and our global network of field service partners managed with proven processes automated tools and controls and we will take advantage of our strong network operation centers innovation labs and integrated deployment activities with our clients and partners worldwideour solutions and capabilities will make black box the trusted digital partner to connect devices to the network in a more connected world once our clients have made the investment to connect these devices theres an opportunity for us to manage those devices to optimize their performance now in many ways the market digital transformation is asking for the solution that black box provides so well we are evolving with this technology shift and recognize changes in the way information as voice data and video is communicated and are adapting to provide solutions to these marketswe believe that positioning black box as the edge solution provider to design deploy and manage solution will resonate well with our clients and partners after all in addition to enabling connectivity for over  years we provide edge products like cables av solutions digital signage and storage devices and were one of the worlds leading kvm providers our products like our services are based on the edge the digital edge is where data is gathered the new digital edge is where realtime data is being turned to information the digital edge is where information is disseminated the digital edge is where decisions are made now at black box our goal is to be the leader in enabling the digital edge to accelerate business decisions and actions all the groups of black box have a primary objective to enable the emerging intelligent edge with solutions that empower our clients to make decisions faster and create a better buying experience for their clientswe also believe that the deployment of iot devices in the intelligent edge is in its nascent stage of evolution we are well positioned to enable the next generation of edge architectures and are already working with leading providers as they empower the edge importantly this moves black box from supporting legacy technology to being at the front of technology transformation that has sustainable growth capability well purposely position the company to provide solutions in a market that not only fits our core capabilities but also has the power at emerging market trend leading companies across all industries are pursuing digital strategies we have a natural footprint in this space and were picking our spots to invest in the talent resources and partnerships to be the leading solutions provider on the edgein addition to all the above were engaged in a business strategy process with leading strategy consultant firm as mentioned in the last earnings call the focus of this engagement is to develop initiatives that will expand our position as a edge solution provider our consulting partner is in the final stages of their analysis and we will share more of those details with you soon prior to our next earnings call we expect to roll out these growth initiatives after that information is shared dave and i will meet with partners and investors to communicate our strategic directionthe foundation work done in fiscal  was successful and position us to turn more of our focus towards growth as an edge solution provider we will position our existing resources to partner with our clients to take advantage of voice data and video device innovation this is a large and attractive market for edge services and we are uniquely positioned to design deploy and manage those solutionsand now with that ill open up the line for questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of greg burns from sidoti  companygregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst so in terms of the transformation of the business and being a leading provider at the edge of the networks can you help us understand maybe some realworld applications or use cases that you see being relevant to that strategy and where you think you could expand to whether its stuff youre currently doing or emerging opportunities that you see in line with that strategyeslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director sure greg first i think its important to understand that were engaged with a lot of these activities already so our historical communication experience plays in this market very well thats part of the voice piece of that transformation that part is not going to go away and were continuing our activities to reposition ourselves in that market from a data standpoint weve been involved with a number of national rollouts where people want to do wireless or wired expansion of their services and theyll do that so that their clients can have a better experiences inside  like their retail stores for example so we recently completed a rollout of  dyi stores as an example for our wireless solution thats there and in those cases we design what those systems look like deploy them and then wake up those systems and make sure they operate and they function properly theres a lot of talk in the market about iot and that involves a lot of different types of devices whether its measuring temperature in areas that need highly controlled temperature devices or whether its measuring presence of people or others were assisting in those activities and that is very similar to what weve done historically with pulling infrastructure and then deploying those devices at the end of the cable were also working on providing many services to those and so that those devices continue to remain active the function is intended and design is there and perform preventive maintenance thats required to them so were engaged with a number of those at present in addition to that the strategy firm that weve engaged with are working on some additional initiatives that will have specific activities to expand our presence into that marketgregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst okay in terms of your internal resources to kind of address this market do you feel like your technical staff has all the skill sets needed to grow in these areas or is there some additional training required or maybe some inorganic means of acquiring some of the certain skills that you feel you might needeslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director yes there are certainly  i mean were building off of a strong base that we have already so this isnt a strong turn for us this is a continuing down the path that weve already got a lot of capabilities in and thats important because were leveraging these  technicians that we already have deployed globally there to build from which is a compelling value differentiator for us but with that said though industry and technology continues to move forward and were continuing to move forward as well a lot of our solutions have  in the past have been more projectbased and were moving to a more solutionsbased and that will take some retraining or some additional skill sets to work with that at this time were not announcing any new technology initiatives and so we dont have a technology gap at present and we might have some of those in the futuregregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst okay and i wanted to better understand the commentary around sga for the first quarter so is it  million to  million exclusive of some incremental expenditures like erp so that  million to  million is kind of a good run rate after those kind of onetime items roll off for the balance of the year is that the way to think about itdavid j russo black box corporation  cfo svp and treasurer yes the best way to think about it greg is the  million to  million excludes those items so thats what i would call i guess a core sga run rate and then those other investments we discussed would be on top of thatgregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst okay and just to set the bar for the first quarter how big are those like kind of other investmentsdavid j russo black box corporation  cfo svp and treasurer well we really havent  we havent really given any type of guidance on that but its going to be in the  probably in the  million to  million rangegregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst and you expect them to roll off into the third quarter or theres going to be some like kind ofdavid j russo black box corporation  cfo svp and treasurer well  so the most significant investment is going to be the erp program and thats going to continue on for a while theres going to be  some of that is going to hit opex and some of its going to be capital expenditureseslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director greg i think in  when we did our last earnings call we said that program was an month program and were still on track for the deployment of that program and it does have a mix of opex and depreciated expensegregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst okay so shouldnt that be included in kind of the run rate sga ordavid j russo black box corporation  cfo svp and treasurer well we wanted to  there were so many adjustments and i guess ill say noise in the  numbers that we thought wed level set and there certainly will be additional costs in there because of those programs the one thing that we really dont fully have our arms around is what percentage of that program will be capitalized and what percentage will be expensedgregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst is there anyone else in the queuedavid j russo black box corporation  cfo svp and treasurer you can keep going greggregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst okay could you talk maybe a little bit about the federal business how youre seeing that shape up are you seeing bidding activity increase whats going on in the federal side of the businesseslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director yes greg as youre aware we repositioned ourselves in a federal business and as a result of that we had a good year with that group this past year and really pleased where they are theyre continuing to strengthen their position in the marketplace there certainly there is the normal competitive pressures that are there but were not seeing anything pick up thats unusual some people have talked about the new administration effect and if there is any effect there were not seeing it play out in our business structure at this time we are seeing a strong level of demand and we were seeing it before the current administration came into placegregory burns sidoti  company llc  analyst okay and the service gross margins were a little bit below what i was looking for going into the quarter how do you see service gross margins going into next year do they bounce back kind of at high  range or is this kind of the new normaleslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director yes weve got some initiatives to work through those theres been some things thats happened last year that we flushed through the system but were aware that theres some opportunities for improvement there and we have some internal initiatives to drive some improvement on that sideoperator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of glenn primack from promise holdingunidentified analyst i was wondering if you had mentioned who the consultant is thats working with you and then as far as the erp like who youre standardizing on thereeslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director yes glenn on both of those cases we cant announce those pieces i can tell you that both of them are the large  very large globally known companies in those spaces but unfortunately i cant share that informationunidentified analyst okay and then the board hasnt changed much i remember the brand as being really strong back in the late s when you wanted todavid j russo black box corporation  cfo svp and treasurer glenn do you have a question pleaseunidentified analyst yes i was just wondering as you morph into this next iteration of black box do you need to  how much change is necessary i guess from the core i understand that edge part but do you need the people  youre set on peopleeslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director yes we think we are i think youll notice that we were pleased to add a board member in november since he had joined us at that point in time and were well positioned with the strength and talents we need at the board levelunidentified analyst okay and then  thats iteslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director well do you have another questionunidentified analyst sure ive got plenty of questions right youre going through a transformation it seems like if youre successful this docks a home run right and you pay a dividend and so if the dividend holds you get paid to wait for you guys to turn around the business thats worth a lot of questions so you got the technicians and the resources how much stuff do you make versus bring in from a vendor and brand it with the black boxeslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director yes so glenn i think you ought to think mainly about if you go back and look at some of the filings weve done that the bulk of our revenue comes through our services business and that will give you a good view of that on the products side of it a good piece of that is work that we resell but i think youll also  you heard that weve had a software group and weve done some acquisitions in the past and so weve got a mix on that particular side sounidentified analyst all right fantastic so are you affected at all by the purchase that belden made of that kvm switch companyeslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director no were notunidentified analyst or will they be a potential european channel for them potentially because that seems like youre really strong in that areaeslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director yes weve got a good position in the kvm switch side and were pleased with where were positioned there i think youll see were one of the top providers globallyunidentified analyst no i think youve always been pretty strong there i mean would that be on that edge enabling areaeslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director we do consider it to be one of the edge productsunidentified analyst okay what would come in you think second place in terms of if thats one of your strongest you have like a top  that you feel pretty confident in or i shouldnt say product because youre moving to solutions which is probably a lot better strategy right from a profit perspectiveeslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director youve identified that correctly we are moving to more of a solution sale than we have historically where its been more of a projectbased sale thats a transition process it will take some time to get through that but i think your analysis of the market opportunities are the same ones that we see if i echo your earlier belief that heres a stock thats historically done well in cash its paying the dividend its going through a transformation youve got a good team that delivered great results last year and so im here believing that well deliver very strong results going forward but  and i think that if you look at how the products set is set there the kvm is a strong player for us theres other ones that are strong from a service standpoint weve got strong capabilities in the wireless space whether its inaudible or these access points or other places out there weve got lots of experience in the structure cable were historically a very strong communications player and continue to get a very strong revenue stream from that side and so weve got a really balanced ability to service that edge market its just going through this transformation and just ask you stay tuned to hear about what may be coming next in that spaceunidentified analyst no it seems pretty exciting do you need to do much training from  you brought in a new head of sales does he need to teach people on how to sell solutions or do you get enough inbound calls from customers with problems that you can inaudible that wayeslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director yes weve got a mix of those that work now i mentioned that in my comments and theres always an evolution of training of skill sets of everybody thats here its one of our major initiative this year for all of us is to continue to improve our skill sets and that includes our sales team is thereglenn can i get you a best and final last questionunidentified analyst no im good i was  like i was on the call i got dropped off i got back on but just looking at your stock it just seems like potentially its super duper cheap and so thats kind of where i invest in within our firm and thats why i just  i had to get on and ask a few thats alleslie c sykes black box corporation  ceo president and director thanks a lot look forward talking to you in the futureoperator im showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to your
