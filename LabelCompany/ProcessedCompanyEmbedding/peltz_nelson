equity value research analyst deep valuemarketplacenew constructs value investing  summarynelson peltz’s trian fund management is seeking a board seat at procter  gambleactivist investors have a mixed track record when it comes to creating shareholder value but peltz appears to have found an ideal situationany reform of the company’s corporate structure should include a renewed focus on return on invested capital roicone of the largest activist investors in the world is taking on his biggest target yet nelson peltz’s trian fund management is seeking a board seat at procter  gamble nysepg now the consumer staples giant is the largest company ever to face a proxy fight signaling that size alone is no longer enough to keep activists away from poorly run companies activist investors have a mixed track record when it comes to creating shareholder value but peltz appears to have found an ideal situation pg has lagged its competitors in recent years peltz has experience revitalizing consumer brands and the stock trades at a discount to its peers peltz has not yet released a detailed plan for pg but any reform of the company’s corporate structure should include a renewed focus on return on invested capital roic roic ranks as the most important metric for global investors and has demonstrable links to valuation linking executive compensation to roic could create immediate shareholder returns and drive a longterm commitment to the lean and disciplined corporate structure that peltz wants pg to adopt this strategy should become part of the playbook for companies looking to avoid activist takeovers procter  gamble’s underperformance the best way to understand the recent failures of pg’s management team is to compare the company to one of its largest competitors the excellently run colgatepalmolive nysecl figure  shows the roic earned by the two companies since  figure  colgatepalmolive’s roic strongly outperforms pg sources new constructs llc and company filings through the late s and early s the two companies earned similar roics but that all changed with pg’s  billion acquisition of gillette in  the acquisition was a big blow to pg’s roic from which the company has never recovered since the acquisition pg stock is up just  vs  for cl and  for the consumer staples spdr etf nysearcaxlp it’s surprising that the gillette deal doesn’t find its way on to more lists of the worst corporate acquisitions need to focus on roic the gillette acquisition represents a classic case of executive incentives misaligned with shareholder interests buying gillette helped pg grow revenue and earnings per share significantly which led to significant increases in bonuses for top executives even as roic and shareholder return lagged peers these misaligned incentives also helped to create the “overly complex and bureaucratized corporate structure” that peltz criticized excessive focus on sales growth and earnings per share pushes managers to invest in low return opportunities as a result you end up with a bloated organization that can’t maintain leadership in its valuecreating products because it’s bogged down by bureaucracy and distracted by failed projects as trian’s proxy statement points out pg’s volume growth has trailed its peers in four out of the past five years which would indicate the company’s key brands are losing market share the company states as much in its most recent k by admitting it has lost market share in its beauty grooming personal health fabric  home care baby feminine  family care segments over the past two years this declining market share points to a real systematic issue facing pg its roic underperformance may have started with the gillette acquisition but that doesn’t tell the whole story even if we totally wiped that  billion in invested capital off the books pg would still have an roic of  behind cl’s  notably cl began tying executive compensation to roic in  pg should follow in cl’s footsteps tying executive compensation to roic would not only prevent a repeat of the gillette acquisition it would also lay the groundwork for a more disciplined and efficient corporate structure this change in executive compensation wouldn’t just be good for shareholders it would be in the best interests of management general motors nysegm successfully held off an activist campaign in  partly through a renewed emphasis on roic if pg is determined to keep peltz off the board a similar shift could help to placate shareholders peltz’s track record peltz and trian have a solid history of helping struggling consumer brands turn their fortunes around in the late s trian took over snapple nysedps a company that had lost  of its value in three years and in another three years managed to restore a good portion of that lost value trian helped push heinz nasdaqkhc to a similarly lucrative buyout and more recently it waged a large campaign against pepsico nysepep although peltz failed to convince the company to split up his initiatives did spur an increase in roic from  to  even as rival cocacola nyseko saw its roic decline most importantly from our perspective pep began tying executive compensation to roic shortly after peltz took his position in the stock we don’t know if peltz was responsible for this decision but the fact that trian’s white paper on the company highlighted its poor roic suggests he might have had a hand in it either way peltz’s track record shows that he has the expertise in brand management cost discipline and capital allocation required to help pg end its recent run of underperformance value opportunity unsurprisingly given pg’s underperformance the stock trades at a discount to its peers figure  shows roic and enterprise valueinvested capital a cleaner version of price to book for pg and  of its peers figure  roic vs enterprise value for household products companies sources new constructs llc and company filings according to the equation in figure  roic explains over  of the differences in valuation for these household products stocks and pg trades at a roughly  discount to its implied evic even if peltz can’t bring any operational improvements just convincing the market to value pg at a level commensurate with its roic would create upside if on the other hand peltz can deliver tangible gains in sales and profitability pg could offer significant returns to investors for example figure  shows the “ upside” to pg stock for a few relatively conservative scenarios column  shows  upside if pg can grow revenue  for the next five years column  shows  upside if pg’s cost cutting initiatives also succeed in increasing the company’s pretax margin from  to  figure  implied valuation scenarios sources new constructs llc and company filings to drive this valuation gain trian and pg will need to convince the market of the sustainability of its roic the way to convince the market of one’s commitment to roic is the same as we’ve suggested many times link it to compensation build into all capital allocation processes show  support from the ceo this article originally published on july   disclosure david trainer and sam mcbride

active and constructive dialogue” with trian it also said that its board was “confident that the changes being made are producing results” and that it “expresses complete support for the company’s strategy plans and management”trian said monday that it was not seeking to break up procter  gamble — a wellworn tactic of activists — or seeking to replace david s taylor who has been the company’s chief executive for less than two years if mr peltz is elected trian said the firm will renominate the director who had been defeated effectively expanding procter  gamble’s board by one seatfor the

companys lagging stock price and railing against its suffocating bureaucracy trian fund management lp on monday announced the nomination of its chief executive and cofounder peltz launching the largest proxy fight ever against a  billion consumer products juggernaut that sells everything from tide detergent and gillette razors to pampers diapers peltzs nomination comes after five months of behindthescenes discussions between trian and pgs top executives and board according to the companys proxy filing at one point the two sides nearly struck a truce in may that would involve pg laying out certain performance metrics over the next year but any sign of an agreement was absent on monday when both came out swinging the yearold company founded on a handshake agreement by a soap and a candle maker issued a statement strongly backing its board and strategic plan see breakingviews column trian which owns about  billion of pgs stock or  percent of the company has until an october annual meeting to convince fellow shareholders that peltz deserves to be voted onto the board the firms campaign website revitalizepgcom and press release has few immediate changes proposed for the company other than advocating for a geographic organizational structure that it believes will empower divisional leaders to make faster and better decisions shares of pg were up slightly at  in afternoon trade trians previous battle with a consumer goods conglomerate was with pepsico inc pepn where it pressured the company to spin off its beverage business from its snacks division a campaign that the company never heeded though it did hand the investor a board seat in  to make peace reutrsuvuea that campaign began with trian advocating peltz for pepsis board and ended with industry veteran william johnson joining as trians representative in a cnbc interview on monday peltz  talked more about trians track record with companies such as hj heinz than actual operational changes needed at pg peltz railed against the companys suffocating bureaucracy but noted he was on good terms with ceo david taylor trian said it wants pg to cut costs more efficiently and that it does not want to replace taylor any board directors or to breakup the company since taylor became ceo in november  pgs stock has gained  percent in contrast the sp  household products index splrcprod which includes kimberlyclark corp kmbn and clorox co clxn has risen  percent over the same period pgs quarterly organic sales which excludes acquisitions and divestitures has fallen just once during his one and half years at the helm for this year the consumer goods giant expects a  percent rise in organic sales growth battle lines file photo  nelson peltz speaks at the wsjd live conference in laguna beach california october  mike blakethe trianpg battle comes as activist investors emboldened by years of successful campaigns for changes at corporations across the us and abroad use their growing coffers to seek bigger targets trian won two seats on hj heinzs board in its  proxy fight and lost its battle to get board representation at industrial conglomerate dupont ddn in  pgs proxy filing disclosed on monday shows that trians dialogue with the company goes back to feb  when peltz called taylor shortly after disclosing the stake to make the introduction and set up an inperson meeting i am quite surprised and very disappointed because i think david taylor and i have developed a very positive relationship peltz told cnbc when asked if he was surprised that the dialogue had turned into a proxy fight i like the man trian said in a press release that its bid to get peltz on the board centers on pgs continuing underperformance costs complexity and culture bitlythc october annual meeting with pgs annual meeting usually held in october the two sides have roughly three months to discuss ways to avoid a shareholder vote on peltz if elected trian has said it wants pg to expand the board to  members rather than have peltz replace a sitting director pgs current board has six past or current ceos including american express ceo kenneth chenault and hewlett packard enterprise ceo meg whitman pg has a bestinclass board of directors that is fully supportive of and actively engaged in overseeing the company’s transformation the company said on monday pgs proxy filing noted that last tuesday in a meeting between trian and members of pgs board trian said it was moving ahead to elect peltz because the company was not moving fast enough to improve its performance pg directors at the meeting said they too were not happy with the performance but that they felt that trian’s representation on the board was unnecessary in light of recent initiatives undertaken by the company the filing said in a bid to boost profits even as sales remain stagnant pg has sold unprofitable brands including  beauty brands to coty inc cotyn and focused on core brands however the efforts have failed to boost the stock much beyond the level where it traded at the beginning of this year trian said that pgs last costcutting plan launched in  failed to impact profit or sales growth barclays noted on monday that trian is working with former pg cfo clayt daley a consultant on the campaign who could become a potential board candidate to replace peltz as part of the negotiations additional

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
