on slm student loan trust  june    am eastern daylight time new yorkbusiness wirefitch ratings has taken the following rating actions on slm student loan trust  slm  class a affirmed at aaasf outlook stable class a aaasf maintained on rating watch negative class a aaasf maintained on rating watch negative class a aaasf maintained on rating watch negative class b asf maintained on rating watch negative maintenance of the rating watch negative on the class a a a and b notes is due to their inability to pass cash flow stresses necessary to maintain their current ratings of aaasf and asf respectively on dec   fitch released an exposure draft that delineates revisions it plans to make to the rating us federal family education loan program student loan abs criteria dated june   this transaction was reviewed under both the existing criteria and exposure draft fitch expects to resolve the rating watch negative status once its revised ffelp criteria report is published key rating drivers high collateral quality the trust collateral comprises federal family education loan program ffelp loans with guaranties provided by eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the us department of education ed for at least  of principal and accrued interest fitchs current us sovereign rating is aaa with a stable outlook sufficient credit enhancement credit enhancement ce is provided by excess spread and for the class a notes subordination provided by the class b notes as of march  fitch calculated effective total parity which includes the reserve fund is  and senior parity is   ce cash is being released from the trust given that the  total parity ratio excluding the reserve is maintained adequate liquidity support liquidity support is provided by a reserve account sized at its floor of  acceptable servicing capabilities daytoday servicing is provided by navient solutions inc formerly known as sallie mae inc fitch believes navient is an acceptable servicer of ffelp student loans criteria variations in certain libordown interest rate stress scenarios the basis spread may be compressed as fitch would apply a floor to onemonth libor at a negative rate level in accordance with fitchs criteria for interest rate stresses in structured finance transactions and covered bonds may  since the updated interest rate stresses are not addressed yet in existing ffelp criteria this represents a criteria variation use of the criteria variation did not have a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned under the counterparty criteria for structured finance and covered bonds dated may   fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterpartys creditworthiness the definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by fitch which represents a criteria variation since the only available funds to invest in are those held in the collection account and the funds can only be invested for a short duration of three months given the payment frequency of the notes fitch doesnt believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned rating sensitivities since the ffelp student loan abs relies on the us government to reimburse defaults aaasf ffelp abs ratings will likely move in tandem with the aaa us sovereign rating aside from the us sovereign rating defaults basis risk and loan extension risk account for the majority of the risk embedded in ffelp student loan transactions additional defaults basis shock beyond fitchs published stresses lower than expected payment speed and other factors could result in future downgrades likewise a buildup of ce driven by positive excess spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future upgrades due diligence usage no thirdparty due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action additional information is available at wwwfitchratingscom applicable

of july                     exhibit    the trust student loan pool   the trust student loans owned by the trust were originally selected from a portfolio of consolidation student loans owned by student loan marketing association by employing several criteria including requirements that each trust student loan as of the original statistical cutoff date and with respect to each additional trust student loan as of its related subsequent cutoff date · was guaranteed as to principal and interest by a guaranty agency under a guarantee agreement and the guaranty agency was in turn reinsured by the department of education in accordance with the ffelp · contained terms in accordance with those required by the ffelp the guarantee agreements and other applicable requirements · was more than  days past the final disbursement · was not more than  days past due · did not have a borrower who was noted in the related records of the servicer as being currently involved in a bankruptcy proceeding and · had special allowance payments if any based on the threemonth commercial paper rate or the day treasury bill rate   no trust student loan as of the applicable cutoff date was subject to any prior obligation to sell that loan to a third party   unless otherwise specified all information with respect to the trust student loans is presented as of july   which is the statistical disclosure date   the following tables provide a description of specified characteristics of the trust student loans as of the statistical disclosure date  the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the loans in each of the following tables includes the principal balance due from borrowers plus accrued interest of  to be capitalized as of the statistical disclosure date  percentages and dollar amounts in any table may not total  or whole dollars due to rounding  the following tables also contain information concerning the total number of loans and total number of borrowers in the portfolio of trust student loans  for ease of administration the servicer separates a consolidation loan on its system into two separate loan segments representing subsidized and unsubsidized segments of the same loan  the following tables reflect those loan segments within the number of loans  in addition  borrowers have more than one trust student loan   the distribution by weighted average interest rate applicable to the trust student loans on any date following the statistical disclosure date may vary significantly from that in the following tables as a result of variations in the effective rates of interest applicable to the trust student loans and in rates of principal reduction  moreover the information below about the weighted average remaining term to maturity of the trust student loans as of the statistical disclosure date may vary significantly from the actual term to maturity of any of the trust student loans as a result of prepayments or the granting of deferment and forbearance periods       a                composition of the trust student loans as of the statistical disclosure date   aggregate outstanding principal balance      aggregate outstanding principal

per loan – treasury bill                  average outstanding principal balance per loan – commercial paper                  weighted average remaining term to scheduled maturity  months   weighted average annual interest rate     we determined the weighted average remaining term to maturity shown in the table from the statistical disclosure date to the stated maturity date of the applicable trust student loan without giving effect to any deferment or forbearance periods that may be granted in the future  see appendix a to the preliminary remarketing memorandum   the weighted average annual borrower interest rate shown in the table is exclusive of special allowance payments  the weighted average spread for special allowance payments to the day treasury bill rate was  as of the statistical disclosure date   the weighted average spread for special allowance payments to the threemonth commercial paper rate was  as of the statistical disclosure date  see “special allowance payments” in appendix a to the preliminary remarketing memorandum   for this purpose the threemonth commercial paper rate is the average of the bond equivalent rates of the threemonth commercial paper financial rates in effect for each of the days in a calendar quarter as reported by the federal reserve in publication h or its successor for that calendar quarter  the day treasury bill rate is the weighted average per annum discount rate expressed on a bond equivalent basis and applied on a daily basis for direct obligations of the united states with a maturity of thirteen weeks as reported by the us department of the treasury       a                    distribution of the trust student loans by borrower interest rates as of the statistical disclosure date     interest rates   number of
