portfolio fort was founded upon a simple premise statistical approaches improve human decisionmaking while the experience of managing a  billion portfolio was invaluable we felt that practical experience alone was not enough human intuition should be combined with statistical expertise in order to produce systematic strategies we founded fort with this mission yves we wanted to test our theories in the real world no matter how confident we might be in our research there is no substitute for actual implementation founding fort was that step sanjiv development in  with the support of their families yves and sanjiv launched fort they immediately faced the challenge of building a hedge fund from the ground up operational infrastructure is as important to clients as investment performance without the benefit of the world bank’s infrastructure to support them yves and sanjiv did what had always come naturally to them and what has become a hallmark of fort’s ethos – they built what they needed while large firms had the resources to hire personnel to assist with trade reconciliation allocation accounting and other middle and backoffice functions yves and sanjiv built automated solutions to ensure they could compete as the firm’s reputation and resources grew yves and sanjiv invested in human capital employees with skills and experience essential to help them further their vision managing institutional assets requires a strong cutting edge infrastructure we have invested consistently in fort’s human capital systems and processes to maintain the highest standards we have steadily developed differentiated strategies that are designed to generate attractive returns over a wide range of market conditions sanjiv growth today fort’s team has grown to over
