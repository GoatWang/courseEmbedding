fletcher  october   lygos inc a company that evolved from the us doe’s joint bioenergy institute recently received two grants  for a phase one project and  for a phase two project under the usda’s national institute of food and agriculture small business innovation research program nifa awarded  grants totaling more than  million to small businesses for research and development to lead to technological innovations and solutions in american agriculture companies who apply for the sbir program initially apply for phase one feasibility studies which may be followed by phase two research and development projects if successful phase one grants are capped at  over a period of eight months and phase two grants top off at  over two years although lygos cannot share specifics on the awarded phase one project the phase two project receiving  will develop new purification techniques for organic acids specifically looking at malonic acid which is lygos’s first product “lygos develops fermentative technology where we engineer microbes to sugars or other renewable resources from carbon and then make projects from those so small molecule chemicals is predominantly what we’re focused on” said jeffery dietrich chief technology officer and founder of lygos biomass magazine reported in  that the company could not disclose specifically which molecules they were targeting but now the company is speaking publically about their first product malonic acid “that grant is really focused on how you get malonic acid out of the fermentation process at a low cost and high efficiency” dietrich said “i would say that the techniques for developing for that process would ideally then be useful for other compounds that we or others are working on as well” dietrich said the company has learned a lot about what types of products they will focus on he compares the company’s strategy when working with compounds in some ways to what pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america do for different drug candidates and applications lygos funnels down from a relatively large number of compounds by doing proof of principle production and then focuses on specific ones to optimize and move to pilot production dietrich said lygos is working on about three different compounds currently all at different stages of optimization “we always knew we were going to work on microbial technologies to produce different compounds and really what we’re finding is our niche area is trying to identify existing chemicals that are currently made for petroleum” dietrich said according to dietrich the processes used to produce these chemicals are extremely environmental hazardous or expensive as a result lygos is focusing on where there are fundamental inefficiencies in the market today where lygos technology can be cost competitive and environmentally friendly “generally speaking we are looking at much higher value commodity and specialty chemicals and our total production cost we estimate will be lower than the raw material cost for the incumbent producers” dietrich said “it is really kind of a unique area where we are looking at what biology does extremely well and where petro chemistry inherently is not going to be able to compete” lygos is in the final stages of negotiating a pilotscale contract and is looking to scale up that process beyond the pilot plant in the next year or two “it’s been a slow but steady route towards commercialization” dietrich said as lygos continues on their route towards commercialization they are looking to collaborate on different projects with larger existing companies “we recognize that as a startup company we’re not going to be able to take our first product to market alone and it’s going to certainly be in partnership”    related articlespowering up new feedstock demandnew hampshire law benefits biomass power production welsh water secures eib loan signs contract with dong energysolving a sweet problem

agriculture feedstocks project methods the project will be conducted using the scientific method in addition to previously measured physicochemical parameters of our system related to production and separation of chemicals we will conduct rampd to investigate the effect of changing specific parameters on the output product quality we will make measurements using laboratory instrumentation including chromatography and mass spectrometry clear documentation and statistical analysis will enable us to refine our approach progress  to outputstarget audience nothing reported changesproblems nothing reported what opportunities for training and professional development has the project providedone research assistant and one scientist have received rigorous training and professional development opportunities through work with our key consultants and senior leadership who have expertise in building fully integrated processes for fermentative production of biochemicals how have the results been disseminated to communities of interest nothing reported what do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals nothing reported impactswhat was accomplished under these goals we continue to explore and optimize unit operations useful for improving our product isolation and purification process publications progress  to outputstarget audienceour target audience has been directed toward the biochemicals industry where fermentation manufacturing is being employed to produce new and existing chemicals in relatively dilute concentrations lygos is developing novel biomanufacturing processes to valuable chemicals our targeted chemicals have been estimated to have existing large markets ranging from mm per year current petroleumbased production of these chemicals has a number of pitfalls current chemical manufacturing requires petroleum feedstocks utilize environmentally damaging processes achieve lowyields and have high production costs in contrast lygos process converts domestic renewable agricultural sugarresidues including corn cornstover woodybiomass and other energy crops into chemicals using fermentation our process is highyielding is performed at ambient temperatures and could decrease production costs significantly while reducing energy costs while our technology holds great promise there are challenges in removing relatively dilute chemicals from the highly aqueous environment of a fermentation broth ultimately customers that may use our chemicals will demand equally pure and stable supplies of product as that derived from petroleum and at the same or better costs development of a complete biomanufacturing process could impact numerous markets and allow for substantial growth to gtbb per year in order to purify chemicals from a fermentation process rampd is required the objective of our phase ii sbir is to establish baseline methods for purification further we test a number of renewable feedstocks in our biomanufacturing process and elucidate potential differences between impurity profiles through these studies we seek to establish a complete benchtop scale process that could deliver lower cost highly pure chemicals at the end of our phase ii effort we expect to have established a suitable workflow that would enable process scaling and commercialization changesproblemswe have modified our plan to accomplish work that was previously assigned to a subcontractorat lygos this has resulted in project delays but we are making substantial progress toward isolating and purifying material and will ultimately enable lygos to provide more routine customer samples and receive validation what opportunities for training and professional development has the project providedour lead scientist has helped to train a junior scientist  technician in process development chemistry and other laboratory techniques how have the results been disseminated to communities of interest nothing reported what do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goalswe will continue to evaluate the various methods for purification and arrive at the most promising combination of isolation methods for implementation at large scale we will populate our technoeconomic models that estimate the cost of product isolation with data that we obtain at benchtop scale experimental work impactswhat was accomplished under these goals we continue to investigate and deploy methods for isolating our dilute organic acidproducts from fermentation broth and evaluate them for economic feasibility in an industrial setting our work has established that some of our previously proposed methods are unlikely to be useful at large scale and some continue to show promise publications
