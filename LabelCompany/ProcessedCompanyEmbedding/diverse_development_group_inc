with a class of securities registered under the securities exchange act of  basis of presentation the summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the companys unaudited condensed financial statements such unaudited condensed financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the companys management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations the results for the period from april   inception to june   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending december   use of estimates the preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates cash cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less the company did not have cash equivalents as of june   concentration of

company did not have cash balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of june     topaz island acquisition corporation notes to unaudited condensed financial statements income taxes under asc  income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of june   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration loss per common share basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity as of june   there are no outstanding dilutive securities fair value of financial instruments the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments recent accounting

limited partners and incentive distribution rights holders each participate differently in the distribution of available cash when a general partner transfers or drops down net assets to a master limited partnership and that transaction is accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control the statements of operations of the master limited partnership are adjusted retrospectively to reflect the dropdown transaction as if it occurred on the earliest date during which the entities were under common control the amendments in this update specify that for purposes of calculating historical epu under the twoclass method the earnings losses of a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner interest and previously reported epu of the limited partners would not change as a result of a dropdown transaction qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings losses differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs also are required this accounting standards update is the final version of proposed accounting standards update eitfa earnings per share effects on historical

sustained operating loss of  during the period from april   inception to june   the company had a working capital deficit of  and an accumulated deficit of  as of june   the companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations andor obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources as may be

about the companys ability to do so the unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern in order to maintain its current level of operations the company

company anticipates that such finalization may occur in the future once and if such change in control occurs the company will file a form k any such change in control anticipates a pro rata redemption of shares and resignation of the current officers and directors appointment of new management and issuance of shares to new shareholders a combination will normally take the form of a merger stockforstock exchange or stockforassets exchange in most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a taxfree reorganization under section  or section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended no assurances can be given that topaz island will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company the most likely target companies are those seeking the perceived benefits of a reporting corporation such perceived benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees increasing the opportunity to use securities for acquisitions providing liquidity for shareholders and other factors business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex the search for a target company will not be restricted to any specific kind of business entities but may acquire a venture which is in its preliminary or development stage which is already in operation or in essentially any stage of its business life it is impossible to predict at this time the status of any business in which the company may become engaged whether such business may need to seek additional capital may desire to have its shares publicly traded or may seek other perceived advantages which the company may offer in implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition the company may become a party to a merger consolidation reorganization joint venture licensing agreement or other arrangement with another corporation or entity on the consummation of a transaction it is likely that the present management and shareholders of the company will no longer be in control of the company in addition it is likely that the

investor should read the following summary together with the more detailed information regarding the company and the common stock being sold in this offering including “risk factors” and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus   the company   history   diverse development group inc the company or ddg a delaware corporation is a company that is in the business of developing and purchasing real estate across all spectrums of the industry throughout the united states the company intends to focus on credit tenant development and acquisitions utilizing a strong balance of holding and selling projects the company will be using the cash raised from the sale of shares to implement its business plan the company is a real estate development and investment company that will build a strong portfolio of investmentgrade retail and commercial leasing properties through acquisition and the pursuit of opportunistic ground up land developments the company intends to utilize market research to diversify its assets nationwide and responsibly optimize its portfolio against risk furthermore the company is seeking external capital from investors the company will operate with little to no debt and hopes to be traded on the otcqb   the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in april  and was formerly known as topaz island acquisition corporation in may  topaz island acquisition corporation filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on form  by which it became a public reporting company   in december  the company implemented a change of control by redeeming shares of existing shareholders issuing shares to new shareholders electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors in connection with the change of control the shareholders of the company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the company’s name from topaz island acquisition corporation to diverse development group inc   business   the companys primary objective is to buy sell and develop real estate assets located within the united states however unlike traditional real estate investment groups ddg intends to operate using cash and little to no debt should the company at any time require debt financing to fulfill its business plan the company shall target shortterm loans only   the companys philosophy is that by using cash for the companys endeavors and by utilizing a development and purchase model using a blend of existing assets with stabilized cash flows and groundup development projects ddg will be able to amass and sustain a strong cash flow with no debt all while maintaining significant assets on the companys books the company also aims to keep overhead low and limit expenses as they relate to soft costs   the company intends to utilize funds pooled from investors to directly invest in incomeyielding properties the company will primarily invest in diversified credit tenant investmentgrade nnn properties with longterm leases the company’s strategic roadmap includes it investing   of its capital for higher return groundup land development projects income will be largely generated from rent and capital gains from development projects the company will not have any debt other than an occasional short term loan that is projectspecific the company’s purchase of existing investmentgrade credit tenant properties should be completed within the first two quarters of total capitalization generating the cash flow and liquidity needed to continue operations      table of contents    risks and uncertainties facing the company   as a development stage company the company has limited operating history and has continuously experienced losses since its inception the company’s independent auditors have issued a report questioning the company’s ability to continue as a going concern that is the company needs to create a source of revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans as a development stage company management of the company has no prior experience in building and selling projects similar to that planned by the company and in marketing and distributing such projects on a broad scale   one of the biggest challenges facing the company is the ability to raise adequate capital to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations which it had not been able to accomplish to the date of the report and or obtain additional financing from its stockholders andor other third parties   due to financial constraints the company has to date conducted limited operations if the company were unable to develop strong and reliable sources of funding for continued operations it is unlikely that the company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan moreover the above assumes that the company’s efforts are met with customer satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady adoption of its solutions amongst the potential base of customers neither of which are currently known or guaranteed   due to these and other factors the company’s need for additional capital the company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   trading market   currently there is no trading market for the securities of the company the company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board as soon as possible which may be while this offering is still in process there can be no assurance that the company will qualify for quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board   the offering   the maximum number of shares that can be sold pursuant to the terms of this offering is  the offering will terminate twentyfour  months from the date of this prospectus unless earlier terminated by the company   this prospectus relates to the offer and sale of  shares “shares” of common stock of the company as follows a  shares offered by the holders thereof the “selling shareholder shares” who are deemed to be statutory underwriters the selling shareholders will offer their shares at a price of  per share   common stock outstanding before the offering                 common stock for sale by selling shareholders                  common stock outstanding after the offering                  offering price     per share             proceeds to the company          based on number of shares outstanding as of the date of this prospectus      table of contents    risk factors   a purchase of any shares is an investment in the companys common stock and involves a high degree of risk investors should consider carefully the following information about these risks together with the other information contained in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part before the purchase of any shares if any of the following risks actually occur the business financial condition or results of operations of the company would likely suffer the market price of the common stock would likely decline and investors could lose all or a portion of their investment the company has listed the following risk factors which it believes to be that material to an investment decision in this offering   the company has limited operating history and as such an investor cannot assess its profitability or performance but must rely on the experience of its chief executive officer and other officers forming its management team   the company is a development stage company and has limited operating history and it is therefore difficult for an investor to assess prior performance or determine whether it likely that the company will meet its projected business plan an investor will be required to make an investment decision based primarily on recent developing operations on management’s history and on projected operations in light of the risks expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered management believes that it is has formulated a business model with sufficient detail and associated expertise to result in a highly successful business venture however there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in its business plans and generate significant revenues   an investment in the company requires a longterm commitment with no certainty of return   it is anticipated that there will be a significant period of time before the company has completed its investments in ground up development projects and each investment may not be liquidated for one to two years after the initial purchase losses on unsuccessful investments may be realized before gains on successful investments are realized dispositions of such investments may require a lengthy time period while it is the intention of the company to achieve target returns over such period other factors such as overall economic conditions the competitive environment and the availability of potential acquirers may shorten or lengthen ddgs holding period therefore it is unlikely that the company will realize substantial gains during its early years   public market risk   it is impossible to predict the price at which units of the company will trade and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for the units will be sustained the units will not necessarily trade at values determined solely by reference to the value of the properties of the company accordingly the units may trade at a premium or a discount to the value implied by the value of the properties of ddg the market price for the units may be affected by changes in general market conditions fluctuations in the markets for equity securities and numerous other factors beyond the control of ddg   the company’s independent auditors have issued a report questioning the companys ability to continue as a going concern   in their audited financial report the company’s independent auditors have issued added an explanatory paragraph that unless the company is able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations andor obtain additional financing there is a substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern the company anticipates that it would need substantial capital over the next  months to continue as a going concern to expand its operations in accordance with its current business plan   the company has accumulated deficit as of september   of    as of september   the company has an accumulated deficit of  this deficit may impact on the company in various ways including but not limited to making it more difficult to borrow money sell stock or to maintain a good market price      table of contents    prior investments no indication of future performance   the past investment performance of the company its founder andor its officers cannot be relied upon as an indication of the companys future performance or success that information is solely intended to illustrate the experience of the company and its management and the type of transactions the company intends to pursue on behalf of ddg those transactions are not intended to be complete or representative of all the transactions in which the company its founder andor its officers have been involved   risk of limited number of investments   although the company intends to achieve diversification of investments the company could deploy its capital in a relatively small number of investments the company may also be less diversified should it raise less capital than anticipated accordingly unfavorable performance by a small number of investments could have a substantial adverse impact on the returns realized by investors in the company   potential difficulty consummating attractive investments   the business of identifying and structuring projects of the nature contemplated by the company is highly competitive ddg will be competing for projects with other acquirers there can be no assurance that the company will be able to invest its capital on terms favorable to the company or in comparison to its competitors it is possible that the company will never be fully invested if insufficient quality projects are available or identified   general risks associated with investment in real estate   the investments of the company will be subject to the risks generally incident to ownership of real property including but not limited to uncertainty of cash flow to meet fixed and other obligations adverse changes in local employment conditions interest rates and real estate tax rates changes in fiscal policies and uninsured losses and other risks that are beyond the control of the company there can be no assurance of profitable operations because the cost of owning real estate assets may exceed the income produced particularly since certain expenses related to real estate and its development and ownership such as property taxes utility costs maintenance costs and insurance tend to increase over time and are largely beyond the control of the owner   investments in real estate development projects   a decision to invest in land or buildings for development will be made based upon certain assumptions about the cost of development time periods for completion of various phases of development and the market value of the developed product while there may be past development or operating history on which to base these assumptions many factors may change resulting in such assumptions being untrue such conditions may contribute to reduced demand for the finished product due to competition economic factors or default or changes in the capital markets such as interest rates or the availability of capital to the extent development costs are financed an investment will be subject to real estate financing risks building construction or site development entails risk related to materials and labor cost increases work stoppages or delays regulatory delays failure of performance or defective materials or workmanship by contractors and suppliers unforeseen weather and unforeseen land conditions such risks can be mitigated to some extent by obtaining performance bonds construction and development guaranties letters of credit andor liens on assets under construction no assurance can be given however that any of the foregoing will be obtained or if obtained will be adequate to cover any loss resulting from any such risks   investments in industrial or commercial assets   investments in industrial or other commercial office properties involve certain risks in addition to those which exist for real estate properties generally including certain environmental risks the financial failure and resulting lease default of a tenant which occupies a material amount of space at a commercial property would cause a reduction in the cash flow to the company moreover such reduction could have the effect of decreasing the value of the property in the event of such a termination there can be no assurance that the company would be able to find a replacement tenant to occupy the space on similar terms and it is probable that the costs incurred to renovate and prepare the space to meet the needs of a replacement tenant would be significant it is also possible that such reductions in cash flow could result in the company to default on the mortgage financing secured by the property industrial and commercial office properties are also subject to competition from providers of similar or alternative space competitors may be able to supply space of similar or superior value at prices equal to or lower than those charged by the company or the entity that owns the industrial or other commercial property such space is also subject to obsolescence as trends styles and technologies change thereby requiring significant infusions of capital to remain competitive and viable in the marketplace      table of contents   financing of real estate projects   although it is contemplated that the acquisition and development of assets will be financed by utilizing minimal or no debt if the company were to acquire debt to finance operations this aspect would increase ddgs exposure to loss principal and interest payments on indebtedness including mortgages having “balloon” payments will have to be made regardless of the sufficiency of cash flow from the assets mortgages requiring “balloon” payments may involve greater risks than mortgages where the principal amount is fully amortized over the term of the loan since the ability to repay the outstanding principal amount of the “balloon” loan may be dependent upon the ability to obtain adequate replacement financing which will in turn be dependent upon interest rates and lenders’ policies at the time of refinancing economic conditions in general and the value of the underlying assets in particular there is no assurance that replacement financing will be available to make “balloon” payments or that if available any replacement financing will be on favorable terms depending on the level of leverage and decline in value if mortgage payments are not made when due one or more of the assets may be lost and the investment therein rendered valueless as a result of foreclosure by the mortgagee   risks on disposition of certain investments   in connection with the disposition of a project the company may be required to make representations about the project typical of those made in connection with the sale of any business or real estate interest the company may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations turn out to be inaccurate incorrect or misleading   volatile market conditions for mortgages and mortgagerelated assets   the company’s results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the markets for mortgages and mortgagerelated assets including commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs as well as the broader financial markets and the economy generally beginning in the summer of  significant adverse changes in financial market conditions resulted in a deleveraging of the entire global financial system and the forced sale of large quantities of mortgagerelated and other financial assets concerns over economic recession geopolitical issues unemployment the availability and cost of financing the mortgage market and a declining real estate market contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and markets as a result of these conditions many traditional mortgage investors suffered severe losses in their residential mortgage portfolios and several major market participants failed or have been impaired resulting in a significant contraction in market liquidity for mortgagerelated assets this illiquidity negatively affected both the terms and availability of financing for all mortgagerelated assets increased volatility and deterioration in the markets for mortgages and mortgagerelated assets as well as the broader financial markets may adversely affect the performance and market value of any cmbs holdings the company may own at the time if these conditions occur institutions from which the company seeks financing for the company’s investments may tighten their lending standards or become insolvent which could make it more difficult for the company to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all adverse developments in the broader residential mortgage market may adversely affect the value of the assets in which the company invests   since the summer of  the residential mortgage market in the united states experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions including defaults credit losses and liquidity concerns certain commercial banks investment banks and insurance companies have announced extensive losses from exposure to the residential mortgage market these losses have reduced financial industry capital leading to reduced liquidity for some institutions these factors have impacted investor perception of the risk associated with cmbs in which the company intends to invest as a result values for cmbs in which the company may invest may experience a certain amount of volatility further increased volatility and deterioration in the broader mortgagebacked securities markets may adversely affect the performance and market value of the companys investments   actions of the us government federal reserve and treasury to stabilize financial markets   in response to the financial issues affecting the banking system and the financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions the us government the federal reserve the treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken action to attempt to stabilize the financial markets it is not possible to predict how future us government actions will impact the financial markets including current significant levels of volatility or the companys current or future investments in addition the us government federal reserve treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address causes of the financial crisis the company cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur and such actions could have a dramatic impact on the companys business results of operations and financial condition   congress has enacted sweeping financial legislation the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the “doddfrank act” signed into law by president obama on july   regarding among other areas the operation of financial institutions many provisions of the doddfrank act will be implemented through regulatory rulemakings and similar processes over several years and many of these rules have not been issued in final form therefore the impact of the doddfrank act and of followon regulation on trading strategies and operations is impossible to predict and may be adverse practices and areas of operation subject to significant change based on the impact direct or indirect of the doddfrank act and followon regulation may change in manners that are unforeseeable with uncertain effects by way of example and not limitation direct and indirect changes from the doddfrank act and followon regulation may occur to a significant degree with regard to among other areas the trading and use of many derivative instruments including swaps and strengthening the oversight and supervision of securities and capital market activities by the us securities and exchange commission “sec” there can be no assurance that such legislation or regulation will not have a material adverse effect on the company in addition congress may address tax policy which also could have uncertain direct and indirect impact on trading and operations      table of contents    further the doddfrank act created the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” an interagency body charged with identifying and monitoring systemic risks to financial markets the fsoc has the authority to require that nonbank financial companies that are “predominantly engaged in financial activities” whose failure it determines would pose systemic risk be placed under the supervision of the federal reserve and subject to enhanced prudential standards the fsoc has the authority to recommend that the federal reserve adopt more stringent prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements for nonbank financial companies supervised by the federal reserve but the federal reserve is expected to establish the prudential standards applicable to such companies the fsoc also has the authority to make recommendations to the federal reserve on various other matters that may affect the company the fsoc may also recommend that other federal financial regulators impose more stringent regulation upon or ban altogether financial activities of any financial firm that poses what it determines are significant risks to the financial system   the implementation of the doddfrank act could also adversely affect the company by increasing transaction andor regulatory compliance costs in addition greater regulatory scrutiny and the implementation of enhanced and new regulatory requirements may increase the companys exposure to potential liabilities and in particular liabilities arising from violating any such enhanced andor new regulatory requirements increased regulatory oversight could also impose administrative burdens on the company including without limitation responding to investigations and implementing new policies and procedures the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and any resulting regulation is not yet certain and the company d may be affected by the new legislation and regulation in ways that are currently unforeseeable   general economic and market conditions   the company’s investments will be affected by general economic conditions and local market conditions economic conditions could affect interest rates the extent and timing of the company’s investment activities and the availability of investments economic conditions could negatively impact the company’s ability to carry out its business or cause it to incur losses   the company’s stock may be considered a penny stock and any investment in the company’s stock will be considered a highrisk investment and subject to restrictions on marketability   if the shares commence trading the trading price of the companys common stock may be below  per share if the price of the common stock is below such level trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended these rules require additional disclosure by brokerdealers in connection with any trades generally involving any nonnasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions such rules require the delivery before any penny stock transaction of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally institutions for these types of transactions the brokerdealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transactions before sale the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in the company’s common stock which could impact the liquidity of the company’s common stock   little experience in being a public company   the company is an earlystage company and as such has little experience in managing a public company such lack of experience may result in the company experiencing difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business further the company may be hampered by lack of experience in addressing the issues and considerations which are common to growing companies if the company’s operating or management abilities consistently perform below expectations the company’s business is unlikely to thrive   the company is an earlystage company with limited developed finance and accounting organization and the rigorous demands of being a public company require a structured and developed finance and accounting group as a reporting company the company is already subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  however the requirements of these laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder entail significant accounting legal and financial compliance costs which may be prohibitive to the company as it develops its business plan services and scope these costs have made and will continue to make some activities more difficult time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel systems and resources   the securities exchange act requires among other things that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the companys business financial condition and results of operations   these rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for the company to obtain director and officer liability insurance if the company is unable to obtain adequate director and officer insurance its ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors especially those directors who may be deemed independent will be significantly curtailed      table of contents    the board of directors could use the issuance or designation of preferred stock to impede or discourage an acquisition of the company that may otherwise be beneficial to some shareholders   the company is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock the issuance of shares of preferred stock or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal for instance the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders in addition under certain circumstances the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock although the company’s board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of the stockholders of the company the board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some or a majority of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock the board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock unless otherwise required by law or otherwise   potential need for additional capital even beyond that offered herein   the company does not presently have sufficient operating capital to implement its existing business model and is dependent upon receipt of proceeds from this offering or elsewhere to expand and develop its business as intended the company believes that the proceeds to the company from the sale of the shares assuming that all shares offered are sold will provide the company with sufficient capital to develop and market the company’s business until it can begin generating enough profits from operations to fund future expansion many factors may however affect the company’s cash needs including the company’s possible failure to generate sufficient revenues from operation if less than all shares are sold the company may not have sufficient capital to fund expansion until sufficient revenues are generated from operations or elsewhere and may be unable to find suitable financing on terms acceptable to the company this event would significantly increase the risk to those persons who invest in this offering   no assurance of investment return   the companys investment portfolio will consist primarily of investments in real estate development projects and operating results in a specified period will be difficult to predict there is no assurance that ddg will be able to generate returns for its investors even if one or more of the projects are successful there can be no guarantee that the shareholders will receive distributions from the company in an amount equal to their investment or at all the returns generated by investors will also be affected by the amount of capital successfully raised by the company   use of any invested funds are immediately available to the company   the offering is being conducted on a best efforts basis and the proceeds from the shares offered hereby will not be subject to escrow and will be made available to the company for its immediate use no assurance can be given as to what number of shares if any will be subscribed or what amount of proceeds if any will be raised and available to the company should the company receive an amount less than offered hereby no assurance can be given as to the companys ability to finance its intended business objectives   the offering price of the shares has been arbitrarily determined by the company and such price should not be used by an investor as an indicator of the fair market value of the shares   currently there is no public market for the companys common stock the offering price for the shares has been arbitrarily determined by the company and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets operations book or other established criteria of value of the company thus an investor should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the shares   investors in the offering may experience immediate dilution of the value of their shares   purchasers of the shares may experience immediate dilution in the value of their shares dilution represents the difference between the initial offering price per share paid by investors and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of the offering net tangible book value per share is the net tangible assets of the company total assets less total liabilities less intangible assets divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding thus if at some other time shares had been sold by the company at a price less than the price paid by purchasers of the shares or had been issued by the company for services or as other noncash consideration then the value of such investor shares immediately after purchase would be less than the purchase price   there has been no prior public market for the companys common stock and the lack of such a market may make resale of the shares difficult   no prior public market has existed for the companys securities and the company cannot assure any purchaser that a market will develop subsequent to this offering the company’s common stock is not presently included for trading on any exchange and there can be no assurances that the company will ultimately be registered on any exchange no assurance can be given that the shares of the company will ever qualify for inclusion on any trading market      table of contents   restrictions on transferability   the shares offered herein are restricted securities and unless registered with the securities and exchange commission can only be sold in compliance with rule  which provides that such securities cannot be sold or transferred for one year the rule  transferability requirements continue after one year for officers directors and greater  percent shareholders who may thereafter sell such securities every three months in an amount equal to the greater of  of the company’s outstanding common stock or the weekly average trading volume over the preceding four weeks to satisfy the requirements of such exemptions from registration under the securities act and to conform to applicable state securities laws each investor must acquire his shares for investment purposes only and not with a view towards distribution   consequently certain conditions of the securities act may need to be satisfied prior to any sale transfer or other disposition of the shares some of these conditions may include but are not limited to a minimum holding period availability of certain reports including financial statements and limitations on the percentage of shares sold and the manner in which they are sold the company can prohibit any sale transfer or disposition unless it receives an opinion of counsel provided at the holder’s expense in a form satisfactory to the company stating that the proposed sale transfer or other disposition will not result in a violation of applicable federal or state securities laws and regulations no public market exists for the shares no market is expected to develop for the foreseeable future and no market may ever develop at all consequently owners of the shares may have to hold their investment indefinitely and may not be able to liquidate their investments or pledge them as collateral for a loan in the event of an emergency   purchase of the shares is a long term investment   an investment in the shares may be long term and illiquid as discussed above the offer and sale of the shares will not be registered under the securities act or any foreign or state securities laws by reason of exemptions from such registration which depends in part on the investment intent of the investors prospective investors will be required to represent in writing that they are purchasing the shares for their own account for longterm investment and not with a view towards resale or distribution accordingly purchasers of shares must be willing and able to bear the economic risk of their investment for an indefinite period of time it is likely that investors will not be able to liquidate their investment in the event of an emergency   no dividends   the company does not currently pay cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying such dividends at any time in the immediate future at present the company will follow a policy of retaining all of its earnings if any to finance development and expansion of its business   arbitration   by execution of the subscription agreement for purchase of the shares investors in this offering agree to submit to arbitration for all claims arising from their investment arbitration may not afford investors all the relief they might obtain outside arbitration arbitration narrows procedural and other steps available to claimants such as discovery broad choice of venue and scope of appellate review and is in general a more informal process than court action on the other hand arbitration is normally a less expensive process for a claimant than court action and normally results in a quicker final decision however investors may find that as a result of arbitration they are more restricted in the resolution of claims if any arising from this investment   limited liability of management   the company has provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws which limit the liability of its officers and directors and provide for indemnification by the company of its officers and directors to the full extent permitted by delaware corporate law such provisions may substantially limit a shareholders ability to hold officers and directors liable for breaches of fiduciary duty   lack of firm underwriter may

larger than m investor demand has risen and is projected to continue to rise and diversify for the net lease sector with an increased desirability for singleasset product types this projection is denoted by an increase in singleasset sales which have reached the highest of the cycle – up  percent year over  year across sectors it should be noted however that net lease portfolio transactions have been constrained throughout  following a peak year in  factor in overall net lease volume declines of  percent yearoveryear   institutions drive onethird of primary market acquisitions primary

incorporated in the state of delaware in april  as of the periods from april   inception through september   the company did not generate any revenue and incurred minimal expenses and operating losses as part of its operating activities   the company anticipates that it would need substantial working capital over the next  months to continue as a going concern and to maintain current level of operations   the company’s independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to the ability of the company to continue as a going concern unless the company is able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations andor obtain additional financing there is a substantial doubt as to the ability of the company to continue as a going concern   revenues and losses   since its inception the

generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the

business planning accordingly the company is considered to be in the development stage  the company has not generated revenues from its operations and there is no assurance of future revenues   there is no assurance that the company’s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital or if additional capital is needed that such funds if available will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the company accordingly given the company’s limited cash and cash equivalents on hand the company will be unable to implement its business plans and proposed operations unless it obtains additional financing or otherwise is able to generate revenues and profits the company may raise additional capital through sales of debt or equity obtain loan financing or develop and consummate other alternative financial plans   discussion of the three months ending september     the company did not generate revenues during the three months ended

period the company had a cash balance of  as of september     as of september  the company has posted only operating losses since its inception in april   inception it has an accumulated deficit since

continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations which it has not been able to accomplish to date and or obtain additional financing from its stockholders andor other third parties   the company does not anticipate that it will generate revenue sufficient to cover its planned operating expenses in the
