virginia which was issued by the general services administration gsa on behalf of the department of the army pursuant to request for proposals rfp no id for a software infrastructure package  the protester contends that the agency’s solesource award lacks a reasonable basis we deny the protest background on july   the gsa issued a request for information rfi on the fedbizoppsgov website announcing the army’s project manager mission command ’s pm mc interest in procuring a commercialofftheshelfnon‑developmental item cotsndi software infrastructure package which allows for immediate rd party development of integrated command post mounted and dismounted tactical computing capabilities to meet the army acquisition executive’s requirement for establishing a common operating environment coe  rfi at   the rfi requested the submission of white papers from interested firms describing the software infrastructure product and its ability to meet fifteen capabilities listed in the rfi the terms of any license agreements and maintenance programs and any relevant past performance of the firm  id at   the rfi also stated that the army desires that the software package be supported by advanced and mature technical services including architecture and deployment support provided by the original equipment manufacturer  id at   the notice additionally advised that the rfi did not constitute a request for proposalsolicitation was not binding on the government and was subject to change  id the agency received five responses by the july  closing date including responses from systematic and raytheon  agency report ar tab  justification  approval ja at   systematic offered its sitaware command and control suite of products and raytheon offered its c product line infrastructure c pli product  id at  tab  acquisition plan at   the agency conducted a review of all five white papers and concluded that systematic provided the only product that met all requirements of the rfi  id at   the agency concluded that raytheon’s c pli product failed to meet the requirements noting that the product was complicated to install not user friendly did not include documentation beyond the initial install did not redacted environments and could only be redacted  id at   on november  the agency notified raytheon that the c pli product did not meet the agency’s requirements  ar tab  agency notification at  based upon the results of the white paper evaluation the agency concluded that the acquisition should be solesourced under the authority of  usc § c and federal acquisition regulation far § ‑ only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements  ar tab  acquisition plan at   a justification for other than full and open competition for systematic’s solution was approved by the gsa on december   ar tab  ja  on january   the gsa posted a combined synopsissolicitation pursuant to the commercial item procedures of far part  for the cotsndi software infrastructure package  rfp at   the rfp notified offerors of the agency’s intent to issue a sole‑source contract to systematic for software license and maintenance of the sitaware suite under the authority of far §   id at   the rfp stated that based upon the gsa’s independent market research the agency determined that “only systematic inc can provide the pm mc with software that meets the following requirements”  id  the rfp then listed the fifteen requirements relevant to this protest were the following  allow hosting on server and workstation hardware including existing us army vehicle computer systems and commercial desktoplaptop systems and army mobile devices of both the tablet and handheld form      deployable on command post mounted platform and dismounted user devices supporting webclients ie browser based as well as stand‑alone client deployment of userlevel capabilities  support clientserver and peertopeer deployment architectures that facilitates reach to enterprise and other serverside services as well as ad‑hoc collaboration and data sharing amongst groups across lan local area network and dil disconnected intermittent and limited networks such as within squads and serverless command posts  provide runtime environments that are interoperable with microsoft windows army gold master linux and android operating system os linux support should include the ability to run infrastructure components in secure containers id the rfp stated that responsible sources may submit a capability statement in response to the solicitation which “shall be considered by the agency”  id  the rfp also stated that the information received would be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement  id in response to the rfp the agency received a proposal from systematic and two capabilities statements from raytheon  systematic proposed its sitaware suite of products and raytheon offered its c pli product which was the same product submitted in response to the rfi and a distributed common ground system dcgsa lite product  ar tab  evaluation of raytheon’s capability statements at  the agency evaluated the capability statements and concluded that only systematic’s product met the requirements of the rfp  the agency found that raytheon’s c pli product and dcgsa lite product did not possess a majority of the requirements  ar tab  evaluation of raytheon’s capabilities statements at ‑  the agency notified raytheon that both capability statements were considered but neither product was determined to be capable of meeting the requirements  ar tab  raytheon notice c pli at  tab  raytheon notice dcgsa lite at  on january  the agency awarded a fixedprice timeandmaterials contract to systematic for a ‑year base period with four year options for a total contract value of   ar tab  award notice at   on february  the agency posted the award notice and the agency’s december  ja on the fedbizoppsgov website  ar tab  award notice at  tab  ja  on february  raytheon filed this protest with our office discussion raytheon challenges the agency’s solesource award to systematic  the protester contends that the agency’s award to systematic lacks a reasonable basis and that the agency’s justification for departing from fullandopen competition was improper  based upon our review of the record we find that the agency provided a reasonable justification for the solesource award to systematic as the only responsible source able to meet the agency’s requirement  the competition in contracting act of  cica requires agencies to obtain full and open competition in procurements through the use of competitive procedures   usc § aa  however cica permits an exception which allows for the use of other than competitive procedures where there is only one responsible source able to meet the agency’s requirement   usc § c far §   when using noncompetitive procedures pursuant to  usc § c such as here agencies must execute a written ja with sufficient facts and rationale to support the use of the cited authority   usc § fa b far §§ d ‑    our review of an agency’s decision to conduct a noncompetitive procurement focuses on the adequacy of the agency’s rationale and conclusions set forth in the ja where the ja sets forth a reasonable justification for the agency’s actions we will not object to the award  ebsco industries inc b‑ mar    cpd ¶  at  here the protester’s challenge to the agency’s solesource award centers on the agency’s consideration of raytheon’s and systematic’s proposed products’ ability to meet the agency’s stated requirements  raytheon argues that the solesource award was improper because raytheon’s products met the solicitation’s requirements while systematic’s product did not meet the requirements  in response the gsa argues that it thoroughly evaluated raytheon’s products and reasonably concluded that they did not meet the solicitation’s requirements  the gsa also asserts that systematic’s product was equally evaluated and found to meet each of the rfp’s requirements  thus the agency contends that its solesource award was proper and adequately justified  as explained below we find the agency’s evaluation and justification reasonable raytheon’s products with respect to raytheon’s cr pli and dcgsa lite products the agency evaluators concluded that the products did “not possess a majority of capabilities” needed to meet the government’s requirement  ar tab  evaluation of raytheon’s capabilities statements at   raytheon asserts that the agency’s conclusions are unreasonable  we find the agency’s evaluation unobjectionable as an initial matter raytheon contends that the agency’s conclusion that the products did not possess a majority of capabilities needed to meet the agency’s requirement was unreasonable because not all of the  listed capabilities were mandatory requirements  for example with respect to the runtime environment capability raytheon asserts that the rfi provided that “the system should provide run‑time environments that are interoperable with microsoft windows army gold master linux and android operating system os”  rfi at   as another example the protester cites to rfi language which states the “system should allow for hosting on server and workstation hardware including existing us army vehicle computer systems and commercial desktoplaptop systems and army mobile devices of both the tablet and handheld form    ”  id  the protester asserts that the agency’s evaluation was improper because the rfi clearly conveys that these capabilities were not essential due to the rfi’s use of the term “should” rather than “shall”  raytheon comments at   we find no support in the record for raytheon’s assertion  while we agree that the rfi provided a number of “should” rather than “shall” requirements including the capabilities cited above the protester’s reliance on the rfi is misplaced  the rfp not the rfi was the controlling document and each of the  requirements was listed as mandatory in the rfp  for example the rfp’s run‑time environment requirement stated “provide runtime environments that are interoperable with microsoft windows army gold master linux and android operating system os”  rfp at   similarly the hosting requirement provided “allow hosting on server and workstation hardware including existing us army vehicle computer systems and commercial desktoplaptop systems and army mobile devices of both the tablet and handheld form    ”  id  the protester’s reliance on language used in the nonbinding rfi which the agency indicated was subject to change is unavailing and fails to demonstrate that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable  raytheon next contends that even if these capabilities were required raytheon’s capability statements demonstrated that its products met the requirements  in response the gsa asserts that the conclusions reached by the agency evaluators were reasonable and in accordance with the solicitation criteria  in this regard the agency states that the solicitation required a software infrastructure package that in addition to other requirements   could be hosted on server and workstation hardware including army mobile devices of both tablet and handheld form  was deployable on dismounted user devices supporting standalone client deployment of userlevel capabilities  was capable of supporting peertopeer deployment architectures within serverless command posts and  was able to provide runtime environments interoperable with linux and android operating systems  supp contracting officer co statement at  rfp at   the agency contends that the cpli and dcgsa lite capability statements did not demonstrate redacted  as explained below we find the agency reasonably evaluated raytheon’s products with respect to the c pli product the agency found that the product could only be redacted and did not support redacted as required the use of redacted devices redacted for dismounted situations was not acceptable and the requirement to meet the client peertopeer deployment architectures was not sufficiently demonstrated  ar tab  evaluation of raytheon’s capabilities statements at   raytheon challenges each of these findings asserting that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable  we have reviewed each of the protester’s challenges and find that none provide a basis on which to sustain the protest  for example with respect to the agency’s finding that the c pli product could only be redacted and does not support redacted the agency explains that its concern was that the c pli product is not capable of stand‑alone operating on army mobile redacted devices  raytheon disagrees with this conclusion asserting that the rfp did not impose any minimum requirement related to redacted  however this assertion is at odds with the rfp which required that the software be deployable on userlevel devices and interoperate with the redacted operating system  indeed raytheon’s own capability statement provided that “for dismounted situations in which pure redacted based tablets or hand held devices are used redacted on the redacted device”  c pli capability statement at   from this record it is clear that the protester understood that the solicitation required the use of redacted based mobile devices as raytheon’s capability statement specifically acknowledged the use of these devices  the protester’s argument that the solicitation did not provide for an redacted requirement is unavailing  we also find no support for the protester’s assertion that c pli’s ability to interoperate with the redacted meets the agency’s requirement at issue herestandalone client deployment on army mobile devices  in this regard the agency explains that the c pli product does not support standalone deployment to redacted because the product is proposed to redacted  thus we find reasonable both the agency’s finding that the c pli product did not meet this specific capability as well as the gsa’s conclusion that the c pli product did not meet the agency’s requirements we likewise find that the agency’s evaluation of raytheon’s dcgsa lite product was reasonable and in accordance with the solicitation criteria  the evaluators found that “though the dcgsa lite solution claims it can be hosted on the command post and mounted computers the user facing functions are redacted and there is no redacted for the mounted or redacted solution” and that the product had “no redacted based capabilities for mounted and handheld solutions”  ar tab  evaluation of raytheon’s capabilities statements at   the evaluators also found that raytheon’s capability statement was unclear as to whether the proposed mediation capability was outofthebox or requires further development and unclear as to how the proposed software development kits can be used by rd party developers  ar tab  evaluation of raytheon’s capabilities statements at   the agency asserts that the solicitation requirements for hosting standalone client deployment of userlevel capabilities and run‑time environments that interoperate with the redacted operating system are the basis for the agency’s findings with respect to the dcgsa lite product  supp co statement at   as with the c pli product raytheon contends that there is no stated requirement to support redacted and argues that the rfp did not define the mounted and dismounted computing environments as necessarily involving redacted devices  with respect to the agency’s finding that dcgsa lite does not provide redacted for the mounted or redacted solution the protester also asserts that the agency’s conclusion was improper because there was no requirement for redacted for the mounted or redacted solution or for redacted capabilities  we find the protester’s argument with respect to the use of redacted devices to be unsupported  the solicitation alerted offerors that the solution must be interoperable with the redacted operating system and be capable of deploying on army mobile devices in the tablet and handheld form with standalone capability which as stated above included redacted devices  with respect to redacted the agency explains that these capabilities are required to demonstrate a runtime environment that interoperates with the redacted operating system  the runtime environment’s interoperability with the redacted operating system was a mandatory requirement of the solicitation as was stand‑alone deployment to army mobile devices  thus we find reasonable the agency’s determination that the dcgsa lite product did not meet the solicitation’s requirements systematic’s product raytheon asserts that the agency’s solesource award to systematic was improper because the sitaware product requires further development to meet the agency’s requirements  specifically the protester alleges that sitaware is not deployable on mounted devices  we find that the agency’s evaluation of the sitaware suite was reasonable the record demonstrates that the agency conducted a thorough evaluation of the sitaware product suite which was documented in a technical evaluation report and an award memorandum  the ja restated the evaluators’ findings that the product is in full compliance with the agency’s requirements ar tab  award memorandum at  and provided that the sitaware suite is the only product that will satisfy the agency’s command post and mounted computing environment requirements  ar tab  ja at   the ja noted that the sitaware suite consists of a unified data environment extending from command post to dismounted tactical computing environments addressing both the command post and mounted computing environments  id  the ja also documented the evaluators’ conclusion that the sitaware suite delivers a common software infrastructure that the agency can extend and utilize  id raytheon disagrees with the agency’s findings and argues that the evaluators determined that more development work was needed for the sitaware suite to be deployed on mounted devices  in support of this argument raytheon points to a meeting between the army and rd party application developers in which the protester alleges an army representative stated that the sitaware suite required further development  in response to raytheon’s allegations the agency contends that the protester takes the discussion during the meeting out of context  the gsa explains that statements given during the presentation to rd party developers were not meant to imply that the sitaware suite itself needed further development rather that further work would need to be done by the army or rd party developers to integrate the sitaware product into the army’s current structure  agency report at  supp co statement at   for example as stated in the presentations it was the intent of the army to use the existing sitaware solution adapt it where necessary and supplement it as required  based on our review of the record we find no support for the protester’s allegation that the sitaware product required further development to support the agency’s requirement for a software infrastructure that is deployable in the mounted computing environment in sum as discussed in detail above the record demonstrates that the gsa had a reasonable basis for concluding that only systematic’s product could meet its requirements  the agency’s ja documented the agency’s evaluation and conclusions that systematic was the only responsible source able to meet the agency’s requirements  we therefore conclude that the gsa reasonably determined that a sole‑source award to systematic would be appropriate under the circumstances the protest is denied susan a poling general counsel  in filing and pursuing this protest raytheon has raised arguments that are in addition to or variations of those discussed herein including assertions of unequal treatment  we have considered all of raytheon’s arguments and find no basis to sustain its protest  the evaluators also concluded that the c pli product was not a cots product that the product could not be used to meet the out of the box requirements of the agency without modification and that there was insufficient discussion in the capability statement about support of rd party developers external to raytheon  id  we need not address in detail each of the agency’s remaining findings because we find that the agency reasonably concluded that the c pli product did not meet the solicitation’s mandatory requirement for standalone client deployment of userlevel capabilities  however we have reviewed the entire record and find no basis to object to the agency’s conclusions with respect to the c pli product  for example we find that the agency reasonably concluded that raytheon’s proposed use of redacted for dismounted situations would preclude the required ability to communicate peertopeer  the evaluators also concluded that the dcgsa lite product was not a cots product  ar tab  evaluation of raytheon’s capabilities statements at   raytheon also argues that the gsa improperly included an associated requirement for engineering support services in the solesource award to systematic without any consideration of whether additional responsible sources exist for those services  in response the gsa explains that the inclusion of maintenance and engineering support services were incidental and ancillary to the purchase of the software to assist with integration and maintenance of the software  we find no basis to object to the agency’s determination  the ja provided that “systematic inc is the developer and exclusive owner of the sitaware suite    and the only source that can provide the required maintenance support and engineering services”  ar tab  ja at   raytheon’s disagreement with the agency’s conclusion does not

roommates laurence k marshall and vannevar bush along with scientist charles g smith founded the american appliance company in cambridge massachusetts its focus which was originally on new refrigeration technology soon shifted to electronics the companys first product was a gaseous helium rectifier that was based on charles smiths earlier astronomical research of the star zeta puppis the electron tube was christened with the name raytheon light offrom the gods and was used in a battery eliminator a type of radioreceiver power supply that plugged into the power grid in place of large batteries this made it possible to convert household alternating current to direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive shortlived batteries in  the company changed its name to raytheon manufacturing company and began marketing its rectifier under the raytheon brand name with great commercial success in  raytheon merged with qrs company an american manufacturer of electron tubes and switches to form the successor of the same name raytheon manufacturing companycitation needed in  it diversified by acquiring acmedelta company a producer of transformers power equipment and electronic auto partscitation needed by the s it had already grown to become one of the worlds largest vacuum tube manufacturing companiescitation needed during world war iiedit early in world war ii physicists in the united kingdom invented the magnetron a specialized microwavegenerating electron tube that markedly improved the capability of radar to detect enemy aircraft american companies were then sought by the us government to perfect and massproduce the magnetron for groundbased airborne and shipborne radar systems and with support from the massachusetts institute of technologys radiation laboratory recently formed to investigate microwave radar raytheon received a contract to build the devices within a few months of being awarded the contract raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems at wars end in  the company was responsible for about  percent of all magnetrons manufactured during the war raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems particularly for submarine detection raytheon ranked st among united states corporations in the value of world war ii military production contracts raytheons research on the magnetron tube revealed the potential of microwaves to cook food in  raytheons percy spencer invented the microwave oven by discovering that the magnetron could rapidly heat food in  the company demonstrated the radarange microwave oven for commercial use after world war iiedit in  the company expanded its electronics capability through acquisitions that included the submarine signal company founded in  a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment with its broadened capabilities raytheon developed the first guidance system for a missile that could intercept a flying target in  raytheon began to manufacture guided missiles in  its lark missile became the first such weapon to destroy a target aircraft in flight raytheon then received military contracts to develop the airtoair sparrow and groundtoair hawk missiles—projects that received impetus from the korean war in later decades it remained a major producer of missiles among them the patriot antimissile missile and the airtoair phoenix missile in  raytheon acquired the marine electronics company apelco applied electronics which significantly increased its strength in commercial marine navigation and radio gear as well as lessexpensive japanese suppliers of products such as marineweather band radios and directionfinding gear in the same year it changed its name to raytheon company during the postwar years raytheon also made generally low to mediumpowered radio and television transmitters and related equipment for the commercial market but the highpowered market was solidly in the hands of larger better financed competitors such as continental electronics general electric and radio corporation of america in the s raytheon began manufacturing

 training design development  delivery  learning technologies and training administration controversiesedit government relationshipedit as the vast majority of raytheons revenues have been obtained from defense contracts there has been a tight relationship of cooperation between itself and the us department of defense and other us government departments and agencies eg in the fiscal year  the national science foundation awarded raytheon  million in grants more than to any other institution and organization in the country for managing nsf south pole station this along with heavy lobbying has led to perennial charges of influence peddling raytheon for instance contributed nearly a million dollars to various defenserelated political campaigns in the presidential election year of  spending much more than that on lobbying expenses and there are many tight ties between the company and all levels of government for example richard armitage a former united states deputy secretary of state is linked to the company through consultancy work john m deutch a former us director of central intelligence sits on the board of directors along with warren rudman a former senator on the other hand raytheon has also been involved in several contract disputes with the us government case of illegally obtaining classified information in a bidding processedit in march  raytheon pleaded guilty to one felony count of illegally obtaining classified air force budget and planning documents us district judge albert v bryan jr imposed a  criminal fine for one felony count of conveyance without authority and  in civil penalties and damages the documents allegedly gave raytheon an unfair advantage against its competitors in bidding for weapons contracts although the plea only involved  air force documents united states attorney henry hudson said raytheon also illegally obtained a wide range of secret pentagon documents disputed claims of the patriot missileedit during the  gulf war raytheon received widespread publicity in the united states in connection with its manufacture of the patriot missile mim patriot the patriot missile is an antiaircraft missile that was upgraded to have some capability against ballistic missiles the patriot had allegedly intercepted scud missiles launched by iraq in its defense against the usled invasion when president george h w bush traveled to raytheons patriot manufacturing plant in andover massachusetts during the gulf war he declared the patriot is  for   scuds engaged  intercepted after the gulf war had concluded the staff of the house government operations subcommittee on legislation and national security reported the patriot missile system was not the spectacular success in the persian gulf war that the american public was led to believe there is little evidence to prove that the patriot hit more than a few scud missiles launched by iraq during the gulf war and there are some doubts about even these engagements the public and the united states congress were misled by definitive statements of success issued by administration and raytheon representatives during and after the war contract disputesedit in october  raytheon paid  million to settle a us government claim that it inflated a defense contract for antimissile radar the pave paws precision acquisition vehicle entry phased array warning system system was designed to detect incoming submarinelaunched ballistic missiles the government claimed in a federal lawsuit that raytheon inflated a contract to upgrade two of four pave paws sites by proposing to hire higherskilled employees than were necessary for the job just one year earlier on october   raytheon paid  million to settle allegations that it misled the united states department of defense by overstating the labor costs involved in manufacturing patriot missiles the recovery of this money is yet another warning to contractors that the truth in negotiations acts information disclosure requirements will be strictly and sternly enforced frank hunger assistant attorney general said in a statement brazilian sivam projectedit allegations of bribery were made against raytheon in  in connection with its efforts to win a  billion dollar radar contract from brazil for the sivam project sivam the acronym for system for vigilance over the amazon was a complex radar surveillance system for use in monitoring the amazon rainforest allegedly to curb the trafficking of narcotics and to curb illegal logging or burning of the forest brazilian police wiretapped a telephone conversation between a special advisor to the brazilian president fernando henrique cardoso and raytheons operative in brazil jose afonso assumpcão according to transcripts published in the brazilian national weekly isto é when assumpcão told gomes dos santos that brazilian senator gilberto miranda might block the raytheon contract gomes dos santos responded damn did you already pay this guy gomes dos santos and brazils aviation minister resigned because of allegations that this conversation suggested that bribes were paid nonetheless raytheon ultimately was awarded the contract after lobbying by the administration of us president bill clinton ages lawsuitedit in  a corporation called ages group filed a lawsuit against raytheon in a federal court in alabama over a  million contract to service c huron and u military aircraft the boston herald reported that ages alleged that the security firm wackenhut corporation hired by raytheon used video and audio surveillance to spy on a consulting firm hired by ages to help it prepare its bid ages also alleged that stolen confidential pricing documents were turned over to raytheon both raytheon and ages had been vying for the contract which raytheon had held for decades but ages won in  on may   reuters reported that raytheon would pay  million to ages group and purchase  million worth of ages aircraft parts to settle the ages lawsuit the settlement was exceptional in that the parties agreed that judgment would be entered against raytheon legally establishing the validity of ages allegations securities litigationedit in october  raytheon was the subject of a number of securities class action lawsuits alleging it had issued a series of materially false and misleading statements including overstating the companys  and  revenues concealing cost overruns and inflating its financial results the suits were brought in response to a massive drop in value of raytheons common stock as traded on the new york stock exchange on tuesday

programming via a shell called zshell and the ti was the first in the series to receive native assembly while the earlier basic programs were relatively simple applications or small games the modern assemblybased programs rival what one might find on a game boy or pda around the same time that these programs were first being written personal web pages were becoming popular through services such as angelfire and geocities and programmers began creating websites to host their work along with tutorials and other calculatorrelevant information this led to the formation of ti calculator webrings and eventually a few large communities including the nowdefunct tifiles and stillactive ticalcorg the ti community reached the height of its popularity in the early s with new websites and programming groups being started almost daily in fact the aforementioned community sites were exploding with activity with close to  programs being uploaded daily by users of the sites there was also a competition between both sites to be the top site in the community which helped increase interest and activity in the community one of the common unifying forces that has united the community over the years has been the rather contentious relationship with texas instruments regarding control over its graphing calculators ti graphing calculators generally fall into two distinct groups those powered by the zilog z and those running on the motorola  series both lines of calculators are locked by ti with checks in the hardware and through the signing of software to disable use of custom flash applications and operating systems however users employed the general number field sieve to find the keys and publish them in  ti responded by sending invalid dmca takedown notices causing the texas instruments signing key controversy enthusiasts had already been creating their own operating systems before the finding of the keys which could be installed with other methods competitorsedit see

november   early yearsedit in  two former tufts engineering college roommates laurence k marshall and vannevar bush along with scientist charles g smith founded the american appliance company in cambridge massachusetts its focus which was originally on new refrigeration technology soon shifted to electronics the companys first product was a gaseous helium rectifier that was based on charles smiths earlier astronomical research of the star zeta puppis the electron tube was christened with the name raytheon light offrom the gods and was used in a battery eliminator a type of radioreceiver power supply that plugged into the power grid in place of large batteries this made it possible to convert household alternating current to direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive shortlived batteries in  the company changed its name to raytheon manufacturing company and began marketing its rectifier under the raytheon brand name with great commercial success in  raytheon merged with qrs company an american manufacturer of electron tubes and switches to form the successor of the same name raytheon manufacturing companycitation needed in  it diversified by acquiring acmedelta company a producer of transformers power equipment and electronic auto partscitation needed by the s it had already grown to become one of the worlds largest vacuum tube manufacturing companiescitation needed during world war iiedit early in world war ii physicists in the united kingdom invented the magnetron a specialized microwavegenerating electron tube that markedly improved the capability of radar to detect enemy aircraft american companies were then sought by the us government to perfect and massproduce the magnetron for groundbased airborne and shipborne radar systems and with support from the massachusetts institute of technologys radiation laboratory recently formed to investigate microwave radar raytheon received a contract to build the devices within a few months of being awarded the contract raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems at wars end in  the company was responsible for about  percent of all magnetrons manufactured during the war raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems particularly for submarine detection raytheon ranked st among united states corporations in the value of world war ii military production contracts raytheons research on the magnetron tube revealed the potential of microwaves to cook food in  raytheons percy spencer invented the microwave oven by discovering that the magnetron could rapidly heat food in  the company demonstrated the radarange microwave oven for commercial use after world war iiedit in  the company expanded its electronics capability through acquisitions that included the submarine signal company founded in  a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment with its

of defense and other us government departments and agencies eg in the fiscal year  the national science foundation awarded raytheon  million in grants more than to any other institution and organization in the country for managing nsf south pole station this along with heavy lobbying has led to perennial charges of influence peddling raytheon for instance contributed nearly a million dollars to various defenserelated political campaigns in the presidential election year of  spending much more than that on lobbying expenses and there are many tight ties between the company and all

technologys radiation laboratory recently formed to investigate microwave radar raytheon received a contract to build the devices within a few months of being awarded the contract raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems at wars end in  the company was responsible for about  percent of all magnetrons manufactured during the war raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems particularly for submarine detection raytheon ranked st among united states corporations in the value of world war ii military production contracts raytheons research on the magnetron tube revealed the potential of microwaves to cook food in  raytheons percy spencer invented the microwave oven by discovering that the

refrigeration technology soon shifted to electronics the companys first product was a gaseous helium rectifier that was based on charles smiths earlier astronomical research of the star zeta puppis the electron tube was christened with the name raytheon light offrom the gods and was used in a battery eliminator a type of radioreceiver power supply that plugged into the power grid in place of large batteries this made it possible to convert household alternating current to direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive shortlived batteries in  the company changed its name to raytheon manufacturing company and began marketing its rectifier under the raytheon brand name with great commercial success in  raytheon merged with qrs company an american manufacturer of

world war ii physicists in the united kingdom invented the magnetron a specialized microwavegenerating electron tube that markedly improved the capability of radar to detect enemy aircraft american companies were then sought by the us government to perfect and massproduce the magnetron for groundbased airborne and shipborne radar systems and with support from the massachusetts institute of technologys radiation laboratory recently formed to investigate microwave radar raytheon received a contract to build the devices within a few months of being awarded the contract raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems at wars end in  the company was responsible for about  percent of all magnetrons manufactured during the war raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems particularly for submarine detection raytheon ranked st among united states corporations in the value of world war ii military production contracts raytheons research on the magnetron tube revealed the potential of microwaves to cook food in  raytheons percy spencer invented the microwave oven by discovering that the magnetron could rapidly heat food in  the company demonstrated the radarange microwave oven for commercial use after world war iiedit in  the company expanded its electronics capability through acquisitions that included the submarine signal company founded in  a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment with its broadened capabilities raytheon developed the first guidance system for

refrigeration technology soon shifted to electronics the companys first product was a gaseous helium rectifier that was based on charles smiths earlier astronomical research of the star zeta puppis the electron tube was christened with the name raytheon light offrom the gods and was used in a battery eliminator a type of radioreceiver power supply that plugged into the power grid in place of large batteries this made it possible to convert household alternating current to direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive shortlived batteries in  the company changed its name to raytheon manufacturing company and began marketing its rectifier under the raytheon brand name with great commercial success in  raytheon merged with qrs company an american manufacturer of electron tubes and switches to form the successor of the same name raytheon manufacturing companycitation needed in  it diversified by acquiring acmedelta company a producer of transformers power equipment and electronic auto partscitation needed by the s it had already grown to become one of the worlds largest vacuum tube manufacturing companiescitation needed during world war iiedit early in world war ii physicists in the united kingdom invented the magnetron a specialized microwavegenerating electron tube that markedly improved the capability of radar to detect enemy aircraft american companies were then sought by the us government to perfect and massproduce the magnetron for groundbased airborne and shipborne radar systems and with support from the massachusetts institute of technologys radiation laboratory recently formed to investigate microwave radar raytheon received a contract to build the devices within a few months of being awarded the contract raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems at wars end in  the company was responsible for about  percent of all magnetrons manufactured during the war raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems particularly for submarine detection raytheon ranked st among united states corporations in the value of world war ii military production contracts raytheons research on the magnetron tube revealed the potential of microwaves to cook food in  raytheons percy spencer invented the microwave oven by discovering that the magnetron could rapidly heat food in  the company demonstrated the radarange microwave oven for commercial use after world war iiedit in  the company expanded its electronics capability through acquisitions that included the submarine signal company founded in  a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment with its broadened capabilities raytheon developed the first guidance system for a missile that could intercept a flying target in  raytheon began to manufacture guided missiles in  its lark missile became the first such weapon to destroy a target aircraft in flight raytheon then received military contracts to develop the airtoair sparrow and groundtoair hawk missiles—projects that received impetus from the korean war in later decades it remained a major producer of missiles among them the patriot antimissile missile and the airtoair phoenix missile in  raytheon acquired the marine electronics company apelco applied electronics which significantly increased its strength in commercial marine navigation and radio gear as well as lessexpensive japanese suppliers of products such as marineweather band radios and directionfinding gear in the same year it changed its name to raytheon company during the postwar years raytheon also made generally low to mediumpowered radio and television transmitters and related equipment for the commercial market but the highpowered

from defense contracts there has been a tight relationship of cooperation between itself and the us department of defense and other us government departments and agencies eg in the fiscal year  the national science foundation awarded raytheon  million in grants more than to any other institution and organization in the country for managing nsf south pole station this along with heavy lobbying has led to perennial charges of influence peddling raytheon for instance contributed nearly a million dollars to various defenserelated political campaigns in the presidential election year of  spending much more than that on lobbying expenses and there are many tight ties between the company and all levels of government for example richard armitage a former united states deputy secretary of state is linked to the company through consultancy work john m deutch a former us director of central intelligence sits on the board of directors along with warren rudman a former senator on the other hand raytheon has also been involved in several contract disputes with the us government case of illegally obtaining classified information in a bidding processedit in march  raytheon pleaded guilty to one felony count of illegally obtaining classified air force budget and planning documents us district judge albert v bryan jr imposed a  criminal fine for one felony count of conveyance without authority and  in civil penalties and damages the documents allegedly gave raytheon an unfair advantage against its competitors in bidding for weapons contracts although the plea only involved  air force documents united states attorney henry hudson said raytheon also illegally obtained a wide range of secret pentagon documents disputed claims of the patriot missileedit during the  gulf war raytheon received widespread publicity in the united states in connection with its manufacture of the patriot missile mim patriot the patriot missile is an antiaircraft missile that was upgraded to have some capability against ballistic missiles the patriot had allegedly intercepted scud missiles launched by iraq in its defense against the usled invasion when president george h w bush traveled to raytheons patriot manufacturing plant in andover massachusetts during the gulf war he declared the patriot is  for   scuds engaged  intercepted after the gulf war had concluded the staff of the house government operations subcommittee on legislation and national security reported the patriot missile system was not the spectacular success in the persian gulf war that the american public was led to believe there is little evidence to prove that the patriot hit more than a few scud missiles launched by iraq during the gulf war and there are some doubts about even these engagements the public and the united states congress were misled by definitive statements of success issued by administration and raytheon representatives during and after the war contract disputesedit in october  raytheon paid  million to settle a us government claim that it inflated a defense contract for antimissile radar the pave paws precision acquisition vehicle entry phased array warning system system was designed to detect incoming submarinelaunched ballistic missiles the government claimed in a federal lawsuit that raytheon inflated a contract to upgrade two of four pave paws sites by proposing to hire higherskilled employees than were necessary for the job just one year earlier on october   raytheon paid  million to settle allegations that it misled the united states department of defense by overstating the labor costs involved in manufacturing patriot missiles the recovery of this money is yet another warning to contractors that the truth in negotiations acts information disclosure requirements will be strictly and sternly enforced frank hunger assistant attorney general said in a statement brazilian sivam projectedit allegations of bribery were made against raytheon in  in connection with its efforts to win a  billion dollar radar contract from brazil for the sivam project sivam the acronym for system for vigilance over the amazon was a complex radar surveillance system

weekly isto é when assumpcão told gomes dos santos that brazilian senator gilberto miranda might block the raytheon contract gomes dos santos responded damn did you already pay this guy gomes dos santos and brazils aviation minister resigned because of allegations that this conversation suggested that bribes were paid nonetheless raytheon ultimately was awarded the contract after lobbying by the administration of us president bill clinton ages lawsuitedit in  a corporation called ages group filed a lawsuit against raytheon in a federal court in alabama over a  million contract to service c huron and u military aircraft the boston herald reported that ages alleged that the security firm wackenhut corporation hired by raytheon used video and audio surveillance to spy on a consulting firm hired by ages to help it prepare its bid ages also alleged that stolen confidential pricing documents were turned over to raytheon both raytheon and ages had been vying for the contract which raytheon had held for decades but ages won in  on may   reuters reported that raytheon would pay  million to ages group and purchase  million worth of ages aircraft parts to settle the ages lawsuit the settlement was exceptional in that the parties agreed that judgment would be entered against raytheon legally establishing the validity of ages allegations securities litigationedit in october  raytheon was the subject of a number of securities class action lawsuits alleging it had issued a series of materially false and misleading statements including overstating the companys  and  revenues concealing cost overruns and inflating its financial results the suits were brought in response to a massive drop in value of raytheons common stock as traded on the new york stock exchange on tuesday october   raytheon shares traded at about  below their level on october   the plunge in stock prices was triggered by a wall street journal report that raytheon was over cost or behind schedule on more than a dozen fixedprice defense contracts this crash represented a loss of about  billion in market value in a single day on may   raytheon reported that it had reached a preliminary agreement to pay  million in cash and securities to settle a classaction lawsuit alleging it misled investors by not disclosing difficulties on various pentagon and construction projects five years before swansons

clouds contained other toxins such as lead and toluene in  raytheon acquired dallasbased esystems including a site in st petersburg florida in november  prior to raytheons acquisition contamination had been discovered at the esystems site soil and groundwater had been contaminated with the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene and dioxane in  groundwater monitoring indicated polluted groundwater was moving into areas outside the site according to dep documentation raytheon has tested wells on its site since  but had not delivered a final report therefore it was given a deadline on may   to investigate its groundwater contamination in the area has not affected anyones drinking water supply or health yet due to negative local media coverage lawsuits are being filed with claims against raytheon citing decreases in property values in another case raytheon was ordered by the environmental protection agency epa to treat groundwater at the tucson plant acquired during the merger

refrigeration technology soon shifted to electronics the companys first product was a gaseous helium rectifier that was based on charles smiths earlier astronomical research of the star zeta puppis the electron tube was christened with the name raytheon light offrom the gods and was used in a battery eliminator a type of radioreceiver power supply that plugged into the power grid in place of large batteries this made it possible to convert household alternating current to direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive shortlived batteries in  the company changed its name to raytheon manufacturing company and began marketing its rectifier under the raytheon brand name with great commercial success in  raytheon merged with qrs company an american manufacturer of electron tubes and switches to form the successor of the same name raytheon manufacturing companycitation needed in  it diversified by acquiring acmedelta company a producer of transformers power equipment and electronic auto partscitation needed by the s it had already grown to become one of the worlds largest vacuum tube manufacturing companiescitation needed during world war iiedit early in world war ii physicists in the united kingdom invented the magnetron a specialized microwavegenerating electron tube that markedly improved the capability of radar to detect enemy aircraft american companies were then sought by the us government to perfect and massproduce the magnetron for groundbased airborne and shipborne radar systems and with support from the massachusetts institute of technologys radiation laboratory recently formed to investigate microwave radar raytheon received a contract to build the devices within a few months of being awarded the contract raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems at wars end in  the company was responsible for about  percent of all magnetrons manufactured during the war raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems particularly for submarine detection raytheon ranked st among united states corporations in the value of world war ii military production contracts raytheons research on the magnetron tube revealed the potential of microwaves to cook food in  raytheons percy spencer invented the microwave oven by discovering that the magnetron could rapidly heat food in  the company demonstrated the radarange microwave oven for commercial use after world war iiedit in  the company expanded its electronics capability through acquisitions that included the submarine signal company founded in  a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment with its broadened capabilities raytheon developed the first guidance system for

from defense contracts there has been a tight relationship of cooperation between itself and the us department of defense and other us government departments and agencies eg in the fiscal year  the national science foundation awarded raytheon  million in grants more than to any other institution and organization in the country for managing nsf south pole station this along with heavy lobbying has led to perennial charges of influence peddling raytheon for instance contributed nearly a million dollars to various defenserelated political campaigns in the presidential election year of  spending much more than that on lobbying expenses and there are many tight ties between the company and all levels of government for example richard armitage a former united states deputy secretary of state is linked to the company through consultancy work john m deutch a former us director of central intelligence sits on the board of directors along with warren rudman a former senator on the other hand raytheon has also been involved in several contract disputes with the us government case of illegally obtaining classified information in a bidding processedit in march  raytheon pleaded guilty to one felony count of illegally obtaining classified air force budget and planning documents us district judge albert v bryan jr imposed a  criminal fine for one felony count of conveyance without authority and  in civil penalties and damages the documents allegedly gave raytheon an unfair advantage against its competitors in bidding for weapons contracts although the plea only involved  air force documents united states attorney henry hudson said raytheon also illegally obtained a wide range of secret pentagon documents disputed claims of the patriot missileedit during the  gulf war raytheon received widespread publicity in the united states in connection with its manufacture of the patriot missile mim patriot the patriot missile is an antiaircraft missile that was upgraded to have some capability against ballistic missiles the patriot had allegedly intercepted scud missiles launched by iraq in its defense against the usled invasion when president george h w bush traveled to raytheons patriot manufacturing plant in andover massachusetts during the gulf war he declared the patriot is  for   scuds engaged  intercepted after the gulf war had concluded the staff of the house government operations subcommittee on legislation and national security reported the patriot missile system was not the spectacular success in the persian gulf war that the american public was
