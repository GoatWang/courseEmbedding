earner ﻿ home high income earner high income earner let us help you reach your financial goals  seems like a big number but it’s not the amount of money you earn in a year it’s the amount of minutes you have in a year now break that number down into how many minutes you spend sleeping eating and working oh and don’t forget family and social commitments in the minutes you have left at the end of the day – do you really want to spend them combing websites looking for the best investment deals and then risking your financial future on a stock you selected after an exhausting  hour day below is a case study that reflects what sva plumb financial was able to do for a doctor who finally decided to relinquish control of his finances take the  minutes yes your minutes to see how many days in a year this physician no doubt saved while moving him closer to his financial goals in life how would you spend that time how weve helped people like you a highearning physician finally made the decision to streamline his financials and minimize his tax burden that first year he saved more than  in taxes now he has a consolidated view of his investments an ongoing savings and investment strategy and understands how he can use the money for his family’s future one of sva plumb’s clients a successful highearning physician likes to understand every aspect of a medical issue before proposing a solution for years this tendency had led him to avoid putting together a comprehensive wealth management plan simply because he didn’t have the time to dive deeply into the process finally after much prompting from his tax advisor the physician decided to take the plunge and talk to sva plumb’s wealth management team in an initial analysis the wealth management team identified several potential risks in the way the doctor’s assets were structured fortunately they also saw a lot of potential first team members reduced his exposure by moving excess cash out of accounts that were only insured for up to  and invested the excess to provide inflation protection then they helped find and consolidate several of the physician’s retirement plan accounts they advised the doctor to keep the high guaranteed rate plans and uncovered an opportunity for him to engage special “catch up” provisions on his contributions to two other plans this strategy saved him more than  in taxes each year for the next three years next with sva plumb now managing the physician’s finances the team coordinated with his attorney to draft new estate documents—documents that hadn’t been updated since his children now in their s were infants the doctor also wanted to establish a charitable foundation but instead sva plumb recommended putting a charitable gift fund in place which is easier to administer and lower cost the doctor agreed with the strategy now in higherearning years he can allocate extra money into that fund earn a tax deduction and later decide on the charity that will receive the funds the doctor has chosen to fund his charitable giving for retirement during his highincome years once again minimizing his taxable income today sva plumb regularly meets with the physician to update his plans based on his goals and income they make everything as easy as possible for him by handling calls with his attorneys retirement plan administrators and other institutions to keep his assets on the right track “when i bring an idea to my client he examines it down to the smallest detail and then he tells us to go ahead with the plan we’re completely transparent in our approach towards wealth management and he trusts us because he knows we act in his best interests at all times our team brings him peace of mind so that he can focus on things most important to him” get to

inherited a  million estate this couple was referred to sva plumb by their law firm they were excited to begin living their dreams but also overwhelmed at the thought of managing the wide variety of

future after thorough evaluation a plan was put in place to help the couple navigate how much they could spend every year and when they could cut back on work and begin transitioning into retirement a
