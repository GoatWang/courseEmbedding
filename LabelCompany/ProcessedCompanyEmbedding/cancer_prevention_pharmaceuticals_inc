is to develop “prevention therapies” for people with elevated risk for cancer cpp’s approach is “don’t wait until you get cancer treat the risk factors” treating risk factors has saved lives in heart disease neurovascular disease and infectious diseases but has yet to be applied to cancer we were founded by some of the most highly respected leaders in preclinical and clinical cancer prevention research the cpp team has well over  years of combined drug development research and commercialization experience we work closely with the national cancer institute nci the food and drug administration fda and the european medicines agency ema to make prevention therapies a reality for those atrisk for cancer we believe the time is right to apply risk reduction paradigms to cancer potential to impact cancer death rates in a significant way lessons from cholesterollowering medicines bloodpressure medicines and vaccines traditional chemotherapy and even newer targeted therapy appear to make only marginal improvements biomarkers and critical path initiative the age of biomarkers and regulatory receptivity fda receptive to surrogate endpoints such as high risk polyps and biomarkers others are on the way economics reimbursement rules are changing for expensive treatments with incremental improvements in survival we cant afford not to prevent featured press cpp and

currently in a phase  clinical trial for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis fap there are currently no approved treatments for fap and no other products in latestage development a genetic disease fap typically develops into colon cancer if left untreated current treatment paradigms require patients to undergo the progressive removal of colon and rectum ongoing endoscopies of the gi tract and additional surgery throughout life  as a result patients with fap experience poor quality of life inconvenience and significant cost  fap has been designated an orphan indication in the us

net proceeds of approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters’ exercise their overallotment option in full from the sale of the shares of common stock offered by us in this offering based on an assumed initial public offering price of  per share the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us a  increase decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of  per share would increase decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately  million assuming that the number of shares offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us similarly a  share increase decrease in the number of shares offered by us as set forth on the cover of this prospectus would increase decrease the net proceeds to us by  million assuming the assumed initial public offering price of  per share the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus remains the same and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us the principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to support our operations to create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets we anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering for the following purposes • up to  million or possibly more depending on the extent of funding available from current agreements with tillotts and sucampo to support our phase  clinical trial of cppxsul for fap as currently contemplated and additional studies necessary for filing an nda with the fda provided that the completion of this phase  clinical trial will depend on the extent of funding available from additional sources including current agreements with tillotts and sucampo • up to  million or possibly more depending on the extent of funding available from current agreements with tillotts and sucampo to support our efforts developing other indications for cppxsul to advance any additional product candidates that we select to expand our internal research and development capabilities to explore new product candidates we currently intend to use a portion of such proceeds to continue to support the following research and development initiatives i a phase  investigatorsponsored clinical trial for early onset of type  diabetes which we expect to support through completion of phase  by contributing drug supply and scientific and regulatory support ii phase  nant study in relapsed refractory neuroblastoma which we expect to support through completion of phase  by contributing drug supply scientific and regulatory support and bioanalytical testing support and iii a gastric cancer prevention study with vanderbilt university which we expect to support through completion of phase a by contributing drug supply scientific and regulatory support and bioanalytical testing support and • the remainder to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes including for costs and expenses associated with being a public company we may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to inlicense acquire or invest in complementary businesses technologies products or assets our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and business condition our primary use of proceeds is for completion of our phase  clinical trial of cppxsul for fap and if it should require additional funding beyond the estimates above we will likely terminate our support of the other research and development referred to above as of the date of this prospectus we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above we may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate the net proceeds of this offering however any such reallocation would be substantially limited to the categories set forth above as we do not intend to use the net proceeds for other purposes the amounts and timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors as a result our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering pending their use we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short and intermediateterm interestbearing obligations investmentgrade instruments certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the us government there are a growing number of biotechnology companies in this space and a few large pharmaceutical companies with internal programs universities and public and private research institutions are also potential competitors while these organizations primarily have educational objectives they may develop proprietary technologies related to the drug delivery field or secure protection that we may need for development of our technologies and products we may attempt to license one or more of these proprietary technologies but these licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and experience manufacturing capabilities regulatory expertise sales and marketing resources and established collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies our competitors either alone or with their collaboration partners may succeed in developing product candidates that are similar or preferable in effectiveness safety cost and ease of commercialization and our competitors may obtain ip protection or commercialize competitive products sooner than we do we evaluate the competition for our products within each individual market segment it is pursuing fap — we believe four companies are currently developing treatments for fap marina biotech inc sla pharma ag thetis pharmaceuticals llc and stemsynergy therapeutics inc • marina biotech is developing an rnaibased therapeutic targeted to a bcatenin they have received orphan drug status for the use of their ceq for the treatment of fap this program has not yet entered clinical trials and we believe is well behind our own stage of development • sla pharma ag a ukbased company is developing a purified “fish oil” product to treat polyposis in clinical studies this agent has been shown to reduce polyposis by  –  which is equivalent to a past celecoxib paradigm that did not achieve market success • thetis pharmaceuticals llc is developing an oral chemoprevention therapy for fap tp which is a derivative of eicosapentaenoic acid “epa” in the free fatty acid form to minimize the occurrence and recurrence of problematic polyps associated with fap according to thetis the potential efficacy of tp for treatment of fap was demonstrated in a randomized placebocontrolled trial conducted by sla pharma using  grams per day of epa as the free fatty acid epaffa for  months in patients with fap in the sla study polyp number polyp size and overall polyp burden all decreased after treatment • stemsynergy therapeutics has published results of preclinical studies with a pyrvinium agent that are relevant to fap and in january  was granted “orphan” drug status for pyrvinium in the treatment of fap cat — we currently know of no other companies that are developing cat drugs celecoxib sulindac aspirin folic acid other nsaids other nutritional supplements and “lifestyle” approaches however continue to be studied in large multicentered trials nb — to our knowledge there has never been a pharmaceutical agent approved for preventing relapse in nb there are a number of experimental agents that have been or continue to be tested in this indication the most promising and advanced experimental offering appears to be a chimerical antibody ch  developed by the national institutes of health “nih”funded children’s oncology group this agent has shown success in a phase  clinical trial as an nb treatment yielding  improvement in subsequent relapses compared to a placebo united therapeutics licensed this drug from the nci and recently received fda approval other therapeutics in development for nb include nifurtimox and an antigd antibody f the latter has been tested exclusively at memorial sloankettering for many years we believe that the lack of commercial drug development efforts in our concentrated spaces are likely the result of regulatory challenges for orphan pediatric indications like neuroblastoma coupled with the small incidence relative to other indications company description we are a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company formed primarily to develop and commercialize therapeutic agents for the treatment and prevention of certain precancerous conditions orphan diseases ie rare diseases and gastrointestinal conditions we have achieved target enrollment in our phase  clinical trial with our product candidate cppxsul for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis “fap” a rare inherited condition that can cause the growth of thousands of colorectal adenomas ie adenomatous polyps which are recognized as a key risk factor for colon cancer and we are a regulatory and commercial collaborator in a phase  clinical trial funded by the national cancer institute the “nci” for the study of colon cancer risk reduction and colon adenoma therapy “cat” a preventative treatment approach for survivors of colorectal cancer or those who have highrisk colon polyps in addition our therapeutic agent has been used in several investigatorsponsored trials and companysponsored preclinical trials including  phase  and phase  investigatorsponsored clinical trials for the treatment of neuroblastoma “neuroblastoma” or “nb” a particularly deadly cancer affecting children funded by nonprofit organizations  phase  investigatorsponsored clinical trial for the treatment of earlyonset type  diabetes funded by the juvenile diabetes research foundation  phase a investigatorsponsored clinical trial expected to be initiated this year for treatment of gastric cancer funded by the nci and  preclinical studies that we have sponsored in the orphan disease and cancer fields  our lead investigational new drug product cppxsul is a combination of the polyamine synthesis inhibitor cppx also known as eflornithine or difluoromethylornithine “dfmo” and the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug sulindac we believe our investigational drug is unique in that it is designed to treat the risk factors eg polyps that are hypothesized to lead to colon cancer and therefore may have the ability to prevent various types of colon cancer unlike other therapies used to treat fap and for use with cat cppxsul is an oral nonsurgical and noninvasive option that we believe has the potential to both improve patients’ quality of life and reduce the sizeable expenses associated with current treatment protocols cppxsul and cppx have received orphan drug designation status for fap in the united states and europe in addition we have received orphan drug designation status for cppx as a single agent for neuroblastoma in the united states and europe and for gastric cancer in the united states we are also pursuing orphan drug designation status for cppx as a single agent for gastric cancer in europe by targeting and treating precursor conditions to colorectal cancer “crc” our product candidates address an important and largely unmet medical need with a market opportunity that we believe is between  and  million in the united states and the european union for fap based on internal studies of the us and eu market and an external study conducted by bridgehead international with respect to certain countries in europe we conducted an analysis of potential pricing scenarios in which we considered among other factors the higher cost to patients for cancer care in the us compared to the eu the worldwide prevalence rate reported by several peer reviewed journals pricing of orphan drugs and of new oncology related therapies current estimated costs of caring for fap patients and potential health care system savings due to the elimination andor reduction of surgical and surveillance procedures reduced doctor visits and endstage disease costs and  billion for cat based on a modest fraction of the estimated  prevalence in the united states reported by the american cancer society and pricing scenarios similar to fap both of the principal active ingredients in our investigational drug candidates eflornithine and sulindac have been previously approved individually but not in combination for other uses by the us food and drug administration the “fda” and have shown limited side effects at the dosages we are studying eflornithine the active ingredient in cppx has never been approved in oral form is not on the market in any systemic dosage form and is not available in any generic form the combination of eflornithine and sulindac delivered in an oral form to which we have exclusive license rights to commercialize from the arizona board of regents of the university of arizona the “university of arizona” and which we refer to as our “combination therapy” showed promising results in an nci supported randomized placebocontrolled phase  clinical trial to prevent recurrent colon adenomas — particularly highrisk precancerous polyps it is our understanding that the reduction of adenoma occurrence demonstrated in the eflornithinesulindac phase  clinical trial is the largest seen in any similar prevention trial to date this understanding is based on peer reviewed journals and neither the fda nor any other regulatory agency has formally evaluated this conclusion we have achieved target enrollment in our  patient doubleblind randomized phase  clinical trial for the use of cppxsul in the treatment of fap the trial conducted at  sites in north america and europe is being partially funded by the proceeds of a codevelopment and license agreement we entered into with tillotts pharma ag “tillotts” a subsidiary of zeria pharmaceuticals company ltd “zeria” and the proceeds of the option and collaboration agreement and securities purchase agreement that we entered into with sucampo ag a wholly owned subsidiary of sucampo pharmaceuticals inc which is a global biopharmaceutical company “sucampo” on january   the agreement with tillotts provides tillotts with european and japanese rights to develop and commercialize the combination of cppxsul for the treatment of fap and other gastrointestinal conditions the option and collaboration agreement with sucampo provides sucampo with an option to enter into an exclusive license to develop and commercialize the combination of cppxsul in north america for the treatment prevention and diagnosis of human diseases and conditions in addition we have also sponsored with the nci a phase  clinical trial for the use of cppxsul to prevent the recurrence of colon cancer or highrisk adenoma a grant award made to swog funds and supports this phase  clinical trial which has been initiated and seeks a target enrollment of  colon cancer patients at swog’s large network of clinical sites throughout the united states swog is a nci sponsored cancer research cooperative group that designs and conducts multidisciplinary clinical trials to improve the practice of medicine in preventing detecting and treating cancer and to enhance the quality of life for cancer survivors swog has been awarded this grant by the nci as a member of the nci national clinical trials network we have also supported investigator sponsored trials using cppx for nb and there are several of these clinical studies currently enrolling and treating patients according to united states cancer statistics published by the american cancer society in the united states in  it is estimated that crc will be the third most commonly occurring cancer among males and females and the third leading cause of cancerrelated deaths highrisk adenomatous polyps are considered the key risk factor for crc in  the disease will be responsible for an estimated  deaths in the united states an even higher rate of incidence occurs in the european union where approximately  people per year die from crc according to the globocan

antioxidants and cancer prevention fact sheet share this content facebook twitter linkedin google email print antioxidants and cancer prevention fact sheet what are free radicals and do they play a role in cancer development free radicals are highly reactive chemicals that have the potential to harm cells they are created when an atom or a molecule a chemical that has two or more atoms either gains or loses an electron a small negatively charged particle found in atoms free radicals are formed naturally in the body and play an important role in many normal cellular processes  at high concentrations however free radicals can be hazardous to the body and damage all major components of cells including dna proteins and cell membranes the damage to cells caused by free radicals especially the damage to dna may play a role in the development of cancer and other health conditions  abnormally high concentrations of free radicals in the body can be caused by exposure to ionizing radiation and other environmental toxins when ionizing radiation hits an atom or a molecule in a cell an electron may be lost leading to the formation of a free radical the production of abnormally high levels of free radicals is the mechanism by which ionizing radiation kills cells moreover some environmental toxins such as cigarette smoke some metals and highoxygen atmospheres may contain large amounts of free radicals or stimulate the bodys cells to produce more free radicals free radicals that contain the element oxygen are the most common type of free radicals produced in living tissue another name for them is “reactive oxygen species” or “ros”  what are antioxidants antioxidants are chemicals that interact with and neutralize free radicals thus preventing them from causing damage antioxidants are also known as “free radical scavengers” the body makes some of the antioxidants it uses to neutralize free radicals these antioxidants are called endogenous antioxidants however the body relies on external exogenous sources primarily the diet to obtain the rest of the antioxidants it needs these exogenous antioxidants are commonly called dietary antioxidants fruits vegetables and grains are rich sources of dietary antioxidants some dietary antioxidants are also available as dietary supplements  examples of dietary antioxidants include betacarotene lycopene and vitamins a c and e alphatocopherol the mineral element selenium is often thought to be a dietary antioxidant but the antioxidant effects of selenium are most likely due to the antioxidant activity of proteins that have this element as an essential component ie seleniumcontaining proteins and not to selenium itself  can antioxidant supplements help prevent cancer in laboratory and animal studies the presence of increased levels of exogenous antioxidants has been shown to prevent the types of free radical damage that have been associated with cancer development therefore researchers have investigated whether taking dietary antioxidant supplements can help lower the risk of developing or dying from cancer in humans many observational studies including case–control studies and cohort studies have been conducted to investigate whether the use of dietary antioxidant supplements is associated with reduced risks of cancer in humans overall these studies have yielded mixed results  because observational studies cannot adequately control for biases that might influence study outcomes the results of any individual observational study must be viewed with caution   randomized controlled clinical trials however lack most of the biases that limit the reliability of observational studies therefore randomized trials are considered to provide the strongest and most reliable evidence of the benefit andor harm of a healthrelated intervention to date nine randomized controlled trials of dietary antioxidant supplements for cancer prevention  have been conducted worldwide many of the trials were sponsored by the national cancer institute the results of these nine trials are summarized following    linxian general population nutrition intervention trial this trial was the first largescale randomized trial to investigate the effects of antioxidant supplements on cancer risk in the trial healthy chinese men and women at increased risk of developing esophageal cancer and gastric cancer were randomly assigned to take a combination of  milligrams mg betacarotene  mg alphatocopherol and  micrograms μg selenium daily for  years or to take no antioxidant supplements the initial results of the trial showed that people who took antioxidant supplements had a lower risk of death from gastric cancer but not from esophageal cancer however their risks of developing gastric cancer andor esophageal cancer were not affected by antioxidant supplementation  in  year results from this trial were reported  years after antioxidant supplementation ended in the updated results a reduced risk of death from gastric cancer was no longer found for those who took antioxidant supplements compared with those who did not   page  of  similar articles garlic and cancer

instead grow out of control forming new abnormal cells these extra cells may form a mass of tissue called a tumor some cancers such as leukemia do not form tumors what are the most common forms of cancer cancer may occur anywhere in the body in women breast cancer is one of the most common in men it’s prostate cancer lung cancer and colorectal cancer affect both men and women in high numbers there are five main categories of cancer carcinomas begin in the skin or tissues that line the internal organs sarcomas develop in the bone cartilage fat muscle or other connective tissues leukemia begins in the blood and bone marrow lymphomas start in the immune system central nervous system cancers develop in the brain and spinal cord how is cancer treated treatment options depend on the type
