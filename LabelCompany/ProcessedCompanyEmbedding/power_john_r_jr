for playing rhythm and blues music on nashville radio station wlac he was also a notable record producer and artist manager richbourg was arguably the most popular and charismatic of the four announcers at wlac who showcased popular africanamerican music in nightly programs from the late s to the early s the other three were gene nobles herman grizzard and bill hoss allen later rock music disc jockeys such as alan freed wolfman jack and others mimicked richbourgs practice of using speech that simulated africanamerican street language of the midtwentieth century richbourgs highly stylized approach to onair presentation of both music and advertising earned him popularity but it also created identity confusion because richbourg and fellow disc jockey allen used africanamerican speech patterns many listeners thought that both announcers were actually africanamericans the disc jockeys used the mystique to their commercial and personal advantages until the mids when their racial identities as euroamericans became public knowledge contents  early history  from newscaster to hep cat  record production and artist management  the final years  benefit concert  aircheck and music recordings  famous phrases  references  further reading  external links early historyedit richbourg was a descendant of french huguenot immigrants as a young man he moved to new york city to work as a theater actor because of the great depression and lack of work he shifted to voice work on radio soap operas tiring of the instability of life as an actor richbourg returned to his native south carolina he obtained a job announcing at wtma in charleston after a year there in  richbourg moved to wlac in nashville during world war ii from  to  richbourg served in the us navy he returned to nashville after his honorable discharge and was invited back to his old job on the air from newscaster to hep catedit wlac first assigned richbourg to the news desk when gene nobles took an extended vacation from the station in the late s richbourg filled in for him richbourg followed nobles lead in playing artists such as otis rush muddy waters howlin wolf and sonny boy williamson artists primarily heard on specialty juke boxes and in mostly southern markets after hours if at all on radio men who performed what richbourg later termed cornfield blues music although some white listeners protested against the music black audiences responded with enthusiasm and began to write fan letters to richbourg because many of the fans misspelled richbourgs surname the disc jockey shortened his onair moniker to john r by the mids john r began attracting euroamerican listeners again—young people teenagers listened to the programs featuring blues music and street talk some as an act of adolescent rebellion richbourg became an influential figure in the fledgling black music trade by featuring groundbreaking rb and early rock performers like chuck berry and fats domino on his program later richbourg capitalized on his reputation by becoming a manager to several artists an occasional record producer and later entrepreneur in nashvilles booming studio industry nashville has long had a national reputation for country music it also has always had studio facilities devoted to soul rb and gospel richbourg may have gained his most enduring reputation as a pitchman who used downhome phrasing to adlib copy for advertisers one example now friends i know you got some soul if you didnt you wouldnt be listenin to ol john r cause i got me some soul ill tell you somethin friends you can really tell the world you got soul with this brandnew swinging soul medallion a jewelry pendant richbourg sold exotic or unusual products such as baby chicks from a pennsylvania hatchery family bibles hotrod mufflers and so on most of these were marketed to an africanamerican clientelecitation needed according to wes smiths book the pied pipers of rock n roll radio deejays of the s and s longstreet press  many such products turned out to be defective andor scams but few irate customers ever sought action against the station or manufacturers one legitimate sponsor was ernies record mart owned by a record label entrepreneur who specialized in recording local nashville rb acts john r featured artists such as james brown baby washington otis redding and other popular soul acts of the s despite the popularity of newer euroamerican performers such as elvis presley and the beatles richbourg continued to play chiefly africanamerican artists he only played mainstream pop when ernies record mart required him to do so in a commercial hourlong radio show on that nightly show titled ernies record parade john r would announce now this six record special the big blues special from ernies record mart is just two dollars ninety eight  plus shipping and handling a total of just  from ernies record mart  rd avenue nashville tennessee when you order ask for the big blues special or simply say offer number two now lets dig this and hed go on to the next set of offers on the ernies record parade radio show record production and artist managementedit while still working at wlac richbourg branched out into record production beginning in the early s and with the stations permission and approval richbourg began recording gospel and blues acts using wlac facilities initially he leased these recordings to other labels in the late s he set up his own label rich records which released rb records and the occasional gospel single although nothing released on rich records became anything more than a regional hit during this era richbourg developed and produced several artists who would go on to have substantial careers in soul music notably bobby hebb rich records ceased operations by  but richbourg continued to develop manage and produce rb talent leasing his productions to a variety of labels he also began using nonwlac studio facilities including the stax records studio and chips momans american recording studio both in memphis as well as various nashville studios around this time he even became a recording artist himself releasing twoblues based singles these singles featured john r tongue firmly in cheek halfsinginghalftalking his way through the lyrics in mid fred foster of sound stage  recordings struck a deal with richbourg and richbourg became the labels de facto head of ar from this point on sound stage  was strictly a soulrb label and almost all of the labels output was produced by richbourg under the aegis of his jr enterprises company richbourgs biggest commercial success was bringing countryinfluenced rb joe simon to the label in  simon had already scored two hits on veejay records in  but was left without a contract when that label went under richbourg became his manager signed him to sound stage  and produced  singles for simon on the label between  and —all of which made the us pop andor rb charts simons biggest success on the label was his  hit the chokin kind which hit  on the rb charts and  pop and sold over a million copies all told richbourg produced over  singles for sound stage  between  and  including minor rb chart hits by ella washington and roscoe shelton as well as singles by roscoe robinson ivory joe hunter sam baker and many other artists beginning in  richbourg split his production activities between his own newly created labels seventy seven and sound plus while still doing occasional work for sound stage  as well he continued to managing and producing joe simon who had moved to spring records as simons manager it was richbourg who recommended that simon try working with a series of different producers after  and simon was rewarded with two more  rb singles s power of love and s get down get down get on the floor other notable artists produced by richbourg during the s included jackey beavers and ann sexton in  john r signed charles smith  jeff cooper to his seventy seven label and their producer dewey vandiver they gave him the biggest hit on the seventy seven label ashes to ashes which sold approximately  records in  and  sexton charted on the lower rungs of the rb charts with two richbourg productions including im his wife youre just a friend these would be richbourgs last hit records as a producer though he continued recording and producing rb soul and gospel acts to the end of his life richbourg retained the rights to virtually all the recordings he produced over the years various compilations of richbourgproduced material have been issued in recent years much of it concentrating on the discs he produced for the rich and sound stage  labels the final yearsedit wlac continued with its block programming divided program schedule featuring news feature programs and some country and pop music in the daytime hours when its signal only reached middle tennessee and the beloved rb shows after  pm when the clearchannel signal settled into the atmosphere enabling the station to be heard throughout much of the north american continent and caribbean islands until about  at that time wlac owners life and casualty insurance company of tennessee brought in for the first time outside management which instituted a top  format in the daytime more importantly for richbourg and the others though the new bosses began to pressure them to start including songs from that playlist in their programs in actuality this was probably a ploy to nudge richbourg and nobles into retirement as the program director obviously saw the nightly soulrb shows as outmoded and inconsistent with the increasingly fashionable rigid formats that most american radio stations had adopted or were about to adopt during that period deciding not to succumb to the dictates of a ratingsdriven system richbourg and the others sold their spots over the years on a per inquiry basis meaning that they kept a commission for each item sold he elected to step down on july   after some  cumulative years of association with the station after his retirement richbourg developed a reputation of generosity to struggling performers often going so far as to lend them money without expecting repayment this would unfortunately haunt the disc jockey as he battled health problems in the last years of his life benefit concertedit by  richbourg was dying from lung cancer his wife margaret and singer jackey beavers a longtime associate organized a benefit concert to help pay the announcers steep medical bills the march   show held at nashvilles grand ole opry house included numerous artists who were featured in john rs broadcasts james brown b b king the neville brothers rufus thomas the tams the coasters gospel singer bobby jones who then hosted a local tv program and beavers now the pastor of a cartersville georgia church himself in his book wes smith commented that james brown gave one of the best performances of his career at the event richbourg survived for about a year dying at age  at his funeral ella washington a favorite artist of john r sang gospel numbers in a tribute to a man who shaped that genre and its secular cousins aircheck and music recordingsedit after retiring richbourg produced cassette tapes featuring reconstructions of his shows together with the music some of these still circulate among traders as do bootleg recordings from the radio broadcasts in  the country music hall of fame released a twovolume set titled night train to nashville it featured recordings which richbourg and his fellow disc jockeys at wlac played on their nightly shows from  and  on each cd one of john rs airchecks can be heard the cd set was released to accompany the hall of fames  exhibit highlighting nashvilles rb music industry and its intersection with the country music business famous phrasesedit you knowrichbourg said this phrase constantly throughout his programs lord have mercy honey have mercyfrequent greeting to open

and blues music on nashville radio station wlac he was also a notable record producer and artist manager richbourg was arguably the most popular and charismatic of the four announcers at wlac who showcased popular africanamerican music in nightly programs from the late s to the early s the other three were gene nobles herman grizzard and bill hoss allen later rock music disc jockeys such as alan freed wolfman jack and others mimicked richbourgs practice of using speech that simulated africanamerican street language of the midtwentieth century richbourgs highly stylized approach to onair presentation of both music and advertising earned him popularity but it also created identity confusion because richbourg and fellow disc jockey allen used africanamerican speech patterns many listeners thought that both announcers were actually africanamericans the disc jockeys used the mystique to their commercial and personal advantages until the mids when their racial identities as euroamericans became public knowledge contents  early history  from newscaster to hep cat  record production and artist management  the final years  benefit concert  aircheck and music recordings  famous phrases  references  further reading  external links early historyedit richbourg was a descendant of french huguenot immigrants as a young man he moved to new york city to work as a theater actor because of the great depression and lack of work he shifted to voice work on radio soap operas tiring of the instability of life as an actor richbourg returned to his native south carolina he obtained a job announcing at wtma in charleston after a year there in  richbourg moved to wlac in nashville during world war ii from  to  richbourg served in the us navy he returned to nashville after his honorable discharge and was invited back to his old job on the air from newscaster to hep catedit wlac first assigned richbourg to the news desk when gene nobles took an extended vacation from the station in the late s richbourg filled in for him richbourg followed nobles lead in playing artists such as otis rush muddy waters howlin wolf and sonny boy williamson artists primarily heard on specialty juke boxes and in mostly southern markets after hours if at all on radio men who performed what richbourg later termed cornfield blues music although some white listeners protested against the music black audiences responded with enthusiasm and began to write fan letters to richbourg because many of the fans misspelled richbourgs surname the disc jockey shortened his onair moniker to john r by the mids john r began attracting euroamerican listeners again—young people teenagers listened to the programs featuring blues music and street talk some as an act of adolescent rebellion richbourg became an influential figure in the fledgling black music trade by featuring groundbreaking rb and early rock performers like chuck berry and fats domino on his program later richbourg capitalized on his reputation by becoming a manager to several artists an occasional record producer and later entrepreneur in nashvilles booming studio industry nashville has long had a national reputation for country music it also has always had studio facilities devoted to soul rb and gospel richbourg may have gained his most enduring reputation as a pitchman who used downhome phrasing to adlib copy for advertisers one example now friends i know you got some soul if you didnt you wouldnt be listenin to ol john r cause i got me some soul ill tell you somethin friends you can really tell the world you got soul with this brandnew swinging soul medallion a jewelry pendant richbourg sold exotic or unusual products such as baby chicks from a pennsylvania hatchery family bibles hotrod mufflers and so on most of these were marketed to an africanamerican clientelecitation needed according to wes smiths book the pied pipers of rock n roll radio deejays of the s and s longstreet press  many such products turned out to be defective andor scams but few irate customers ever sought action against the station or manufacturers one legitimate sponsor was ernies record mart owned by a record label entrepreneur who specialized in recording local nashville rb acts john r featured artists such as james brown baby washington otis redding and other popular soul acts of the s despite the popularity of newer euroamerican performers such as elvis presley and the beatles richbourg continued to play chiefly africanamerican artists he only played mainstream pop when ernies record mart

these recordings to other labels in the late s he set up his own label rich records which released rb records and the occasional gospel single although nothing released on rich records became anything
