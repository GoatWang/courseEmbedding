with paphpv together™ results in significantly fewer falsenegative results than either test used alone  marlborough mass may   prnewswire  a new cervical cancer screening study demonstrates that paphpv together™ cotesting remains the most effective strategy for detecting highgrade cervical lesions hologic inc nasdaq holx announced today the study published this month in cancer cytopathology a peerreviewed journal of the american cancer society also showed no significant difference between the sensitivities of the pap and hpv tests when either was used alone as a primary screening method study details the authors from houston methodist hospital evaluated a database with  pap test results of these patients  were screened with paphpv together and  underwent followup biopsies the hpv test results were performed using the cobas® hpv test and cobas®  system from roche diagnostics while the pap tests were performed with the thinprep® pap test a liquidbased test from hologic or the surepath™ liquidbased pap test from bd diagnosticskey takeaways the study confirmed that screening with paphpv together detected more cases of precancer and cancer than either test used alone paphpv together missed significantly fewer cases of highgrade cervicovaginal lesions – only  percent – compared to either the cobas hpv test  percent or the pap test  percent when used alone further when used alone as primary screening methods sensitivity results for the cobas hpv test and the pap tests were comparable according to the study the researchers concluded our data strongly support the view that currently cytologyhpv cotesting is the best strategy for screening women who are  years old or older   with data continuing to mount that screening with paphpv together is more effective than screening with either hpv or pap alone in women over  the clinical benefit of continuing the cotesting strategy is clear said edward evantash md medical director and vice president of medical affairs hologic this study underscores the value of realworld data in accurately reflecting test performance as compared to clinical trial results alone the pap test performance in the study aligned with the college of american pathologists cap benchmarking database demonstrating that when cytology performance is on par with us national averages cotesting performance is optimized   the study further supports current consensus guidelines from multiple organizations including the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists which recommends screening for cervical cancer with a pap test and an hpv test together for women ages  to  all women deserve the best possible protection against cervical cancer which is once again proven to be the use of pap and hpv tests together said evantash offering hpvalone screening would be a step backward and unnecessarily put womens lives at risk the new study corroborates previous research including the largest retrospective cervical cancer screening study conducted in the united states the  quest study the quest study found that paphpv together identified more cervical precancer and cancer than either test used alone and demonstrated that one in five cases of cervical cancer was missed with hpvalone screening about paphpv together both hologics thinprep® pap test and its aptima® hpv assay are the marketleading products for

to market the aptima® herpes simplex virus hsv    molecular assay on the fully automated panther® system the test will be commercially available in the  united states us territories and puerto rico according to the us centers for disease control and prevention infections with hsv the herpes strain with more serious health implications affect more than  million americans the aptima hsv    assay can be used to qualitatively detect and differentiate between hsv and hsv specimens collected in a broad range of transport media including the aptima specimen transport medium can be tested with the assay helping our clinical lab customers consolidate testing on the panther system enables them to be more efficient and productive said tom west president of the diagnostic solutions division at hologic by partnering with our customers well be better able to offer more people highquality and faster testing results and improve detection of stis like herpes this new product clearance reflects our commitment to providing healthcare professionals and patients with greater certainty and peace of mind the hsv assay joins a growing list of molecular tests available on hologics panther system a marketleading integrated platform that fully automates molecular testing for laboratories the panther system substantially reduces handson time for laboratories by providing random and continuous access with rapid turnaround time many usbased laboratories today conduct hsv testing via live culture which is both timeconsuming with additional manual steps and slow delivering results in days rather than hours in addition studies show that hsv molecular diagnostic tests are three to five times more sensitive than live culture samples hologic estimates that tests run on the panther system benefit more than  million people worldwide annually these include assays for other sexually transmitted infections such as human papillomavirus chlamydia trachomatisneisseria gonorrhea trichomonas vaginalis and a virology menu including hiv and hepatitis c viruses how the new assay works the aptima hsv    assay is a nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative detection and differentiation of hsv types  and  in cliniciancollected swab specimens from anogenital skin lesions these samples can be collected using either the new aptima multitest swab specimen collection kit or commercially available viral transport media the aptima multitest swab specimen collection kit offers healthcare providers greater versatility in sample collection the assay can be used to aid in the diagnosis of hsv andor hsv infections in symptomatic women and men it distinguishes between hsv  and  which is recommended in all patients with firstepisode genital herpes patients with hsv are at increased risk for contracting and transmitting hiv human immunodeficiency virus pregnant women infected with hsv are at risk of transmitting the virus to their babies during birth which can cause

paphpv together™ results in significantly fewer falsenegative results than either test used alone  marlborough mass may   prnewswire  a new cervical cancer screening study demonstrates that paphpv together™ cotesting remains the most effective strategy for detecting highgrade cervical lesions hologic inc nasdaq holx announced today the study published this month in cancer cytopathology a peerreviewed journal of the american cancer society also showed no significant difference between the sensitivities of the pap and hpv tests when either was used alone as a primary screening method study details the authors from houston methodist hospital evaluated a database with  pap test results of these patients  were screened with paphpv together and  underwent followup biopsies the hpv test results were performed using the cobas® hpv test and cobas®  system from roche diagnostics while the pap tests were performed with the thinprep® pap test a liquidbased test from hologic or the surepath™ liquidbased pap test from bd diagnosticskey takeaways the study confirmed that screening with paphpv together detected more cases of precancer and cancer than either test used alone paphpv together missed significantly fewer cases of highgrade cervicovaginal lesions – only  percent – compared to either the cobas hpv test  percent or the pap test  percent when used alone further when used alone as primary screening methods sensitivity results for the cobas hpv test and the pap tests were comparable according to the study the researchers concluded our data strongly support the view that currently cytologyhpv cotesting is the best strategy for screening women who are  years old or older   with data continuing to mount that screening with paphpv together is more effective than screening with either hpv or pap alone in women over  the clinical benefit of continuing the cotesting strategy is clear said edward evantash md medical director and vice president of medical affairs hologic this study underscores the value of realworld data in accurately reflecting test performance as compared to clinical trial results alone the pap test performance in the study aligned with the college of american pathologists cap benchmarking database demonstrating that when cytology performance is on par with us national averages cotesting performance is optimized   the study further supports current consensus guidelines from multiple organizations including the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists which recommends screening for cervical cancer with a pap test and an hpv test together for women ages  to  all women deserve the best possible protection against cervical cancer which is once again proven to be the use of pap and hpv tests together said evantash offering hpvalone screening would be a step backward and unnecessarily put womens lives at risk the new study corroborates previous research including the largest retrospective cervical cancer screening study conducted in the united states the  quest study the quest study found that paphpv together identified more cervical precancer and cancer than either test used alone and demonstrated that one in five cases of cervical cancer was missed with hpvalone screening about paphpv together both hologics thinprep® pap test and its aptima® hpv assay are the marketleading products for
