during working years most individuals have little choice in their health insurance coverage employees and their family members typically enroll in the health insurance plan offered by their employer and don’t ‘shop’ for a personal policy unless selfemployed however once you turn  and are no longer working typically you have choices to make about medicare initial enrollment period each individual has their own initial enrollment period which begins  months prior to your th birthday and ends  months following your th birthday if you want your coverage to start the first day of your birth month you will want to enroll within the  months leading up to your birthday if you are  still working and enrolled in a group policy that covers  or more employees you are eligible for an extended special enrollment period where you can enroll in medicare after your th birthday to avoid late enrollment penalties you will need to enroll within  months of your group coverage ending if you miss both of these enrollment periods you are eligible to enroll in medicare during the general enrollment period january  – march  annually however late enrollment penalties may apply for each year you delay signing up before you enroll before enrolling you may ask yourself what does medicare cover and what are my options original medicare includes part a and part b part a covers hospitalization expenses and part b covers doctor visits if you or your spouse has paid into medicare for over ten years you will not owe a premium for part a but will still be responsible for an annual deductible with part b individuals are responsible for a monthly premium based on household income as well as an annual deductible and coinsurance because there are various out of pocket expenses associated with part a and part b individuals have the option to obtain a standardized supplemental medigap insurance policy to cover expenses original medicare may not cover if you enroll in a medigap policy during your initial enrollment period you will not be subject to medical underwriting and cannot be denied lastly there is an option to enroll in a part d drug plan through private insurers depending on your current prescriptions you’ll want to shop around as plans vary in monthly premium amount deductible and coinsurance if you have creditable retiree coverage through your employer this may replace the need for a part d andor supplemental policy medicare options as an alternative to original medicare individuals have the option of enrolling in a medicare advantage part c plan through a private insurer more like an hmo or ppo medicare advantage plans cover all care that part a and b cover and sometimes include drug coverage if you join a medicare advantage plan you do not need a supplemental policy but are still required to enroll in part a and part b as well as pay part b premiums along with any premiums due for your medicare advantage plan if you enroll in a medicare advantage plan and later decide to switch over to original medicare you may do so but you will be required to pass health underwriting there are many factors to consider before enrolling in medicare are you healthy or do you require a high level of healthcare what prescription drugs are you currently taking do you travel a lot or live in multiple places throughout the year be sure to talk with your financial advisor andor medicare specialist prior to enrolling to discuss which options may best fit your current health care needs may    watch those medicare part b  part d prescription drug coverage premiums you may be paying higher premiums than you should by brittany samples  medicare shj blog tips  no comments for our seniors  and those caring for seniors… did you know that if your income has dropped significantly you may be eligible for a reduction of your medicare part b  and part d prescription drug coverage premiums if you’ve ever received a letter from social security telling you that your income level causes you to pay extra premiums on your medicare part b and part d then you should be aware of these rules the social security administration receives data that is twoyears old specifically your modified adjusted gross income magi each year from the internal revenue service irs and uses this information to determine the amount of your monthly premiums if your income has dropped below specific thresholds your premiums will decrease and vice versa see the chart below for a breakdown of income levels and premiums required in  source the important thing to note is that you don’t have to wait for two years for social security to get updated information from the irs instead if you know your magi has dropped below the income threshold on which your current premiums are based then you can file an appeal along with some required documentation of your current magi and request a review required documentation is a copy of your filed tax return and an irs transcript a letter or statement from the irs stating they have corrected your tax information and explaining the correction your amended tax return along with a letter from the irs accepting your amended return or an irs transcript your copy of your tax return that shows an obvious irs transcription error in taxexempt interest income or your declaration under penalty of perjury that you lived apart from your spouse for the entire year when you filed your income tax return as “married filing separately” source if the social security administration finds that you’ve been paying a higher premium than you should have been then they will refund the excess within  days of notifying you of their findings so don’t wait keep an eye on your income level and if you’re due a reduced premium get filing for

saw huge changes in the world’s economies political systems and population growth the history of the american stock market both reflects these changes and used them to develop into what we see today next we will explore the new york stock exchange nasdaq and sp  the new york stock exchange as we saw in part i what was called the new york curb market moved indoors into a new building on greenwich street in lower manhattan by now it had established codes of conduct and listing requirements by  despite the great crash of  the curb exchange was the world’s leading stock market and listed more foreign issues than all of the other us securities markets combined radio was developing and in the s radio amex began to broadcast stock prices and market changes so investors and traders could have uptotheminute information between  and  the share value traded on the american stock exchange had more than doubled to  billion in  the nyse and amex brought many of its informational and other services together to form the national securities industry automation corporation or siac one result of such a development was educational services on for example options trading trading stocks had become a much more complex process so the intention was to help investors learn more about markets and make more informed decisions trading options and futures are two such examples options give buyers and sellers the right should they choose to trade an asset at a given price at some point during the life of that contract futures trading is similar but buyers and sellers must trade at that price making profitable decisions now about what someone may or must do in the future demanded reliable information in  amex introduced derivative trading a derivative is a security whose price is based on and depends on or is derived from the value of underlying assets these underlying assets include stocks and bonds commodities currencies interest rates and overall market indices in  amex was bought by and merged with nyse euronext euronext was a european stock exchange that traded in cash and the derivatives markets it also produced market data for traders to use the world indeed became more accessible when these major exchanges and market analysts merged across the two continents nasdaq “nasdaq” stands for the national association of securities dealers automated quotations system beginning in  it was the first electronic exchange where investors could buy and sell online without having to meet on a trading floor nasdaq is today a worldwide provider of financial technology information and trading services it operates in  countries around the world nasdaq’s online services have enabled the world’s stock markets to evolve dramatically because it is an allelectronic service it attracted companies such as apple microsoft and dell today nasdaq services many thousands of clients and publishes approximately  global indexes covering all kinds of industries and market sectors this data enables trading professionals to analyze markets in detail and to advise their clients accordingly nasdaq major business segments all use its technology and software to generate and publish the data the technology then enables approximately  companies representing approximately  trillion in market valuation to list with nasdaq the listings bring buyers and sellers together so they can trade in the many different asset classes offered as a result the nasdaq stock market is the largest single pool for trading in us equities sp standard and poor’s the company began as the standard statistical company in  when its indicator included only  publicly traded companies it merged with poor’s publishing in  resulting in the index showing  companies  it was on january   that it hit the famous  mark it is now an index that tracks the value of  large companies currently representing approximately  trillion of corporate valuation that are listed on the nyse and on nasdaq hence

 by buhvdesigns  shj blog stock market  no comments the first stock markets got their start as kings merchants and adventurers traveled to new unexplored lands in search of new riches but it was the development of new technology that helped transform early markets into the exchanges we all know and recognize today a brief introduction to the markets the first exchanges were for debts rather than assets medieval kings and crusading lords had to borrow money to fund their expeditions and wars they borrowed the money from wealthy merchants by selling part of the debt to other merchants in exchange for a share in the profit when the debts were repaid with interest today we call this trading of debt “bond markets” in order for the great shipping nations of europe to explore and discover new lands and resources such as gold spices raw materials and other luxuries the fleets of ships being used had to be funded in some cases the monarch funded the exploration ferdinand and isabella of spain funded columbus’s voyage of  for example in other cases the funding came from merchants rather than merely lend the money and trade the bonds to reduce the risk merchants began to join together to form a company that funded their own venture they were literally the first venture capitalists initially a new company would be formed for each voyage and be disbanded when the fleet returned as the process evolved the same company with the same jointly held stock hence jointstock company owned by the same merchant adventurers would fund new trading ventures many companies grew wealthy and their stock became a valuable highly sought after asset in its own right instead of buying stock shares for cash they could simply be traded because not every ship would return to port laden with goods for sale merchants would spread their risk by exchanging stocks in one business venture for stocks in another the regular trading of stock certificates in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries grew into an official formal and controlled element of modernday finance the world had become a larger place with international trade now let us jump ahead and look at the more recent history of the stock market the first stock exchanges great britain was the center of one of the greatest empires as well as the center of trade commerce and industrial output in the late th century london saw the world’s first official stock exchange open in  the london stock exchange lse could not actually trade stocks at the time unscrupulous business owners had caused so much financial damage that the speculative trading of stocks was illegal until  outside financing was needed for new ventures so investors bought stock in these new companies they just could not trade existing stock certificates among themselves in  the new york stock exchange nyse opened its doors new york was the center of america’s domestic and international trade banking and manufacturing the nyse was america’s second stock exchange the first one being the philadelphia stock exchange which began in  both markets were able to speculatively trade in stocks the nyse quickly outgrew its philadelphia competitor and is today the largest stock market on the planet nyse’s early days stock traders used to meet on the open street and were known as “curbstone brokers” as they formalized their role and location  of america’s leading brokers met under a buttonwood tree to sign “the buttonwood agreement” which created the nyse and they moved their location to wall street the brokers established rules and set fees for trading they copied many european practices and the nyse became a wealthy organization the most important regulations the nyse established were “listing requirements” for a company to be quoted and traded on the nyse it must meet certain standards listing requirements cover for example a company’s size its annual income or its market value and its liquidity liquidity essentially means how quickly its stock can be traded at a given value any stock can trade quickly at a bargain price but overall stability is needed for owners who buy and sell the stocks today if a company wants to be traded on the nyse it must have issued at least  million shares for publictrading and they must be worth at least  million as america’s economy and its place in the world grew so did the power and authority of its stock markets new stock exchanges opened in other major economic areas for example chicago in the midwest and los angeles on the west coast existing industries grew and new industries began rules and regulations developed to cope with both business complexity and the expanding world of international trade brought on by the rise of technology traders and owners including pension companies and other institutional investors needed new clear and trusted methods of stock valuation and comparison new trading floors opened their doors to address the needs of the new marketplaces in part ii of this blog which will be posted in a few days we will look at how the stock market has changed to meet the demands of both growth and these new industries sources part  nyse timeline and

and cons of owning stock where you work by buhvdesigns  investment portfolio shj blog stock market tips  no comments many companies offer stock options and stock bonuses to their employees but is owning stock where you work a good idea the short answer it depends below are our thoughts on the pros and cons of owning stock where you work pros one ‘pro’ to owning stock in the company where you work is the added motivation you have for the company to succeed as an ‘owner’ in the company your success is tied to their success this holds true for the employees you manage as well more than the incentive to work hard owning stock in the company you work for can pay off quickly often companies offer their stock at discounted prices to employees buying stock at a discount can pay off if the company does well in general you may want to limit your company stock exposure to  of your net worth or less to maintain diversification cons your paycheck is already tied to your employer and tying more of your investment portfolio to the company where you work could significantly increase your risk while being motivated to help the company grow can positively benefit your investment it doesn’t mean the company is destined to be successful their downfall can mean a big financial loss for you remember general motors enron and lehman brothers the bottom line owning stock in the company you work for can be a beneficial part of your financial plan talking to your financial advisor before making a decision to invest where you work is a good idea call  for a complimentary consultation feb    stock market recap with joel javer cfp® by brittany samples  economy investing joel javer shj blog shj team stock market  no comments volatility is increasing in the us markets making it more difficult to determine what direction your investments should take in  when oil slid from  to barrel the us stock market rallied in anticipation that lower gasoline prices would allow consumers to spend this windfall somewhere more interesting than the pump but that hasn’t happened yet so far all we’ve seen are layoffs in the oil patch and more price swings in the sp  europe is justifiably concerned about greece and its willingness to resolve its debt crises they keep talking and positioning as well as negotiating via the media with the germans but nothing significant has happened yet so far this year international markets have had some gains even slightly more than the us but the structural problems outside the us make us remain cautious over the past  years the best place to invest your money has been the sp  this index is likely a bit overvalued right now and perhaps the international markets are a bit undervalued but no one knows when the trend will change it appears that the us dollar will maintain the dominant currency for the foreseeable future making our exports more expensive this does however allow foreign companies to increase their sales to the us likely making them more profitable the us has seen substantial job growth but minimal wage growth over the past year which is encouraging news for corporate profits we have yet to see consumer spending rebound to its pre great recession levels but as more people get reemployed and old debts are repaid the outlook for the us appears to be the brightest around how does this translate into your portfolio design a large part of your portfolio will remain invested in the us with some allocations hedged to the us dollar in international stocks and bonds bond positions will remain primarily in us corporations with some international exposure but the us looks like the place to be right now sharkey howes  javer is a denverbased financial planning and investment management firm for additional
