america and the th anniversary of six flags over georgia in  tv commercialsedit in  although dc comics and looney tunes as well as scoobydoo still had a major presence at the parks six flags began a new series of commercials for the parks the commercials introduced a new mascot mr six a seemingly feeble old man in a tuxedo and red bow tie in many of the commercials mr six would slowly exit a multicolored bus only to start frenetically dancing to the vengaboys we like to party the commercials were an immediate hit and mr six almost instantly became the de facto mascot and his presence was felt for years after the character was retired these ads have become widely parodied on the internet with faces from other internet memes being superimposed over mr sixs face from  to  six flags tv ads consisted of a funometer in which the beginning of the ad showed something boring or embarrassing and a mans face judges it one flag or sometimes  oh two flags then roller coasters and attractions of six flags are shown and says six flags more flags more fun for six flags parks however the thick accent of the asian man in the original commercials had drawn criticism for being an offensive caricature in  the mr six character came back from retirement and replaced the asian man in six flags ads still using the funometer in  six flags tv ads got a brandnew slogan go big go six flags for its theme parks licensing with other brands and companiesedit six flags has licensed its name and its theme park creations to other companies who have used these assets to create licensed products one notable such example is the theme park simulation game roller coaster tycoon  which featured recreations of six flags parks and rides that could be expanded and operated at the players discretion in  six flags partnered with brash entertainment to create a video game based on the six flags parks named six flags fun parkcitation needed the game was first released on the nintendo ds and pc in october  the wii version was delayed after brash entertainment went out of business and so the rights were taken over by ubisoft and released the game on the wii in march  the game allows players to explore the themed areas and minigames representative of a visit to a six flags park in the game players are tasked with quests that encourage them to explore the parks universe after creating a unique custom character six flags fun park patrons can win prizes and compete with other players in  minigames although the video game is called six flags fun park it lacks any major reference of six flags outside of the names of the different areas this caused some to speculate that the video game was created separately then the rights to the name of the game were sold as a way to pay for the games developmentcitation needed when the game was released it eventually ended up getting abysmal ratings across the board ign gave the wii version a  out of  saying the quests are uninteresting and the games  thrilling games as touted by the box are far from entertainingcitation needed in recent years six flags has created strategic partnerships with other companies who would feature their

and looney tunes as well as scoobydoo still had a major presence at the parks six flags began a new series of commercials for the parks the commercials introduced a new mascot mr six a seemingly feeble old man in a tuxedo and red bow tie in many of the commercials mr six would slowly exit a multicolored bus only to start frenetically dancing to the vengaboys we like to party the commercials were an immediate hit and mr six almost instantly became the de facto mascot and his presence was felt for years after the character was retired these ads have become widely parodied on the internet with faces from other internet memes being superimposed over mr sixs face from  to  six flags tv ads consisted of a funometer in which the beginning of the ad showed something boring or embarrassing and a mans face judges it one flag or sometimes  oh two flags then roller coasters and attractions of six flags are shown and says six flags more flags more fun for six flags parks however the thick accent of the asian man in the original commercials had drawn criticism for being an offensive caricature in  the mr six character came back from retirement and replaced the asian man in six flags ads still using the funometer in  six flags tv ads got a brandnew slogan go big go six flags for its theme parks licensing with other brands and companiesedit six flags has licensed its name and its theme park creations to other companies who have used these assets to create licensed products one notable such example is the theme park simulation game roller coaster tycoon  which featured recreations of six flags parks and rides that could be expanded and operated at the players discretion in  six flags partnered with brash entertainment to create a video game based on the six flags parks named six flags fun parkcitation needed the game was first released on the nintendo ds and pc in october  the wii version was delayed after brash entertainment went out of business and so the rights were taken over by ubisoft and released the game on the wii in march  the game allows players to explore the themed areas and minigames representative of a visit to a six flags park in the game players are tasked with quests that encourage them to explore the parks universe after creating a unique custom character six flags fun park patrons can win prizes and compete with other players in  minigames although the video game is called six flags fun park it lacks any major reference of six flags outside of the names of the different areas this caused some to speculate that the video game was created separately then the rights to the name of the game were sold as a way to pay for the games developmentcitation needed when the game was released it eventually ended up getting abysmal ratings across the board ign gave the wii version a  out of  saying the quests are uninteresting and the games  thrilling games as touted by the box are far from entertainingcitation needed in recent years six flags

america and the th anniversary of six flags over georgia in  tv commercialsedit in  although dc comics and looney tunes as well as scoobydoo still had a major presence at the parks six flags began a new series of commercials for the parks the commercials introduced a new mascot mr six a seemingly feeble old man in a tuxedo and red bow tie in many of the commercials mr six would slowly exit a multicolored bus only to start frenetically dancing to the vengaboys we like to party the commercials were an immediate hit and mr six almost instantly became the de facto mascot and his presence was felt for years after the character was retired these ads have become widely parodied on the internet with faces from other internet memes being superimposed over mr sixs face from  to  six flags tv ads consisted of a funometer in which the beginning of the ad showed something boring or embarrassing and a mans face judges it one flag or sometimes  oh two flags then roller coasters and attractions of six flags are shown and says six flags more flags more fun for six flags parks however the thick accent of the asian man in the original commercials had drawn criticism for being an offensive caricature in  the mr six character came back from retirement and replaced the asian man in six flags ads still using the funometer in  six flags tv ads got a brandnew slogan go big go six flags for its theme parks licensing with other brands and companiesedit six flags has licensed its name and its theme park creations to other companies who have used these assets to create licensed products one notable such example is the theme park simulation game roller coaster tycoon  which featured recreations of six flags parks and rides that could be expanded and operated at the players discretion in  six flags partnered with brash entertainment to create a video game based on the six flags parks named six flags fun parkcitation needed the game was first released on the nintendo ds and pc in october  the wii version was delayed after brash entertainment went out of business and so the rights were taken over by ubisoft and released the game on the wii in march  the game allows players to explore the themed areas and minigames representative of a visit to a six flags park in the game players are tasked with quests that encourage them to explore the parks universe after creating a unique custom character six flags fun park patrons can win prizes and compete with other players in  minigames although the video game is called six flags fun park it lacks any major reference of six flags outside of the names of the different areas this caused some to speculate that the video game was created separately then the rights to the name of the game were sold as a way to pay for the games developmentcitation needed when the game was released it eventually ended up getting abysmal ratings across the board ign gave the wii version a  out of  saying the quests are uninteresting and the games  thrilling games as touted by the box are far from entertainingcitation needed in recent years six flags has created strategic partnerships with other companies who would feature their

campaigns for each park sometimes with special themes like the th anniversary of six flags great america and the th anniversary of six flags over georgia in  tv commercialsedit in  although dc comics and looney tunes as well as scoobydoo still had a major presence at the parks six flags began a new series of commercials for the parks the commercials introduced a new mascot mr six a seemingly feeble old man in a tuxedo and red bow tie in many of the commercials mr six would slowly exit a multicolored bus only to start frenetically dancing to the vengaboys we like to party the commercials were an immediate hit and mr six almost instantly became the de facto mascot and his presence was felt for years after the character was retired these ads have become widely parodied on the internet with faces from other internet memes being superimposed over mr sixs face from  to  six flags tv ads consisted of a funometer in which the beginning of the ad showed something boring or embarrassing and a mans face judges it one flag or sometimes  oh two flags then roller coasters and attractions of six flags are shown and says six flags more flags more fun for six flags parks however the thick accent of the asian man in the original commercials had drawn criticism for being an offensive caricature in  the mr six character came back from retirement and replaced the asian man in six flags ads still using the funometer in  six flags tv ads got a brandnew slogan go big go six flags for its theme parks licensing with other brands and companiesedit six flags has licensed its name and its theme park creations to other companies who have used these assets to create licensed products one notable such example is the theme park simulation game roller coaster tycoon  which featured recreations of six flags parks and rides that could be expanded and operated at the players discretion in  six flags partnered with brash entertainment to create a video game based on the six flags parks named six flags fun parkcitation needed the game was first released on the nintendo ds and pc in october  the wii version was delayed after brash entertainment went out of business and so the rights were taken over by ubisoft and released the game on the wii in march  the game allows players to explore the themed areas and minigames representative of a visit to a six flags park in the game players are tasked with quests that encourage them to explore the parks universe after creating a unique custom character six flags fun park patrons can win prizes and compete with other players in  minigames although the video game is called six flags fun park it lacks any major reference of six flags outside of the names of the different areas this caused some to speculate that the video game was created separately then the rights to the name of the game were sold as a way to pay for the games developmentcitation needed when the game was released it eventually ended up getting abysmal ratings across the board ign gave the wii version a  out of  saying the quests are uninteresting and the games  thrilling games as touted by the box are far from entertainingcitation needed in recent years six flags has created strategic partnerships with other companies who would feature their products inside the parks on march   six flags announced that it will sell no other pizza besides papa johns at its parks in turn six flags will receive an annual sponsorship and promotional opportunities from papa johns though financial details of the deal have not been disclosed however in the  season it was

breaking three local teenagers hospitalized after being rescued in lake michigan close ap how did six flags entertainment corp pull off this crazy market stunt newsfeedbackfoolcom anders bylund jul   updated  hrs ago shares of theme park operator six flags entertainment nyse six closed  higher on wednesday following the release of thoroughly disappointing secondquarter resultsyou heard me right six flags missed wall streets revenue and earnings targets but share prices still jumped on the news its usually the other way around rightdont worry ill help you sort out this strange turn of events by the numbersmetricq q yearoveryear growthrevenue million millionnet income million milliongaap earnings per share dilutedadjusted ebitda profits million milliondata source six flagsfirst six flags headed into this earnings report with little to prove and much to gain share prices had declined  year to date and a fairly large number of analysts called the stock more of a hold than a buysecond some of the financial weakness was simply beyond the companys control for example heavy rains in texas and the east coast region over the memorial day weekend put a serious dent in six flags secondquarter numbers the storms came back again in the second half of june cutting down the expected summer tourist crowds these weather events were especially hard on six flags highmargin sales of singleday park passesfinally management kept a stiff upper lip about the stormy situation and noted that weatherrelated effects tend to balance out over the course of a full summer season so the third quarter is shaping up to mend some of the second quarters failings and it helps that six flags recently completed two brandnew water parksanalysts had been looking for earnings of  per share on sales near  million but all of these ameliorating factors made it easy to shrug off the large misses and focus on the future insteadimage source getty imagescool so whats next for six flags looking ahead six flags management likes what they see in recent waterpark results and have been fielding calls from waterpark operators around the country who might want to make a tradesince we announced our water park acquisition strategy we have received multiple inbound inquiries from water park operators around the us said six flags ceo jim reidanderson on the earnings call so the opportunity is not only compelling but its large scalethis management team is not in the habit of issuing firm guidance figures but reidanderson did underscore the improved weather several times so i guess we should take that as a solid hint things are looking up but management wont tell us exactly how rosy the picture might bethis stock chart is as rocky as six flags roller coasters and theres no real end in sight to that volatility but investors have pocketed a marketbeating  gain in five years and the stock comes with a generous  dividend yield whatever happens to the waterpark strategy six flags is plotting some international expansion over the next several years sounds like a strong plan to me as long as you have the stomach for a few unexpected twists and turns along the way were talking about a pretty
