the first organization to design and implement a formal matrix structure for its space program encyclopedia of business nd ed  functional organization departmentalize the work force and other resources by key functionsdisciplines  results in efficient specialization of labor easy to comprehend roles responsibilities are clearly defined reduces duplication of work  can lead to “silos” departments become selfserving poor communication across the organization  product organization semiautonomous units and profit centers based on activities or “projects”  increases accountability – direct relation between activity and objective decentralized decision making loyalty to the project  can lead to duplication of effort lack of communication across units  matrix organization – agile responsive to shifting priorities focused on company goals maintains discipline specializationglenn research centercontrols and dynamics branch at lewis field  matrix organization – pros  cons strengths  flexibility  facilitates rapid response to changes  improves communication and creates efficient exchange of information – people across various departments are working on common goals and information is exchanged both horizontally and vertically  more efficient use of resources – highly specialized skills and equipment can be shared across multiple objectives  improved motivation – empowered teams have direct impact on day to day decisions and have greater commitment to the goalsweaknesses  confusion about who is in charge – staff perceives having too many “bosses”  constant conflict about roles and responsibilities  complex and sometimes duplicative reporting requirements  conflicting goals line and project creates interpersonal conflict and “finger pointing”  increased costs – more managers and more reporting glenn research center controls and dynamics branch at lewis field  matrix organization what can go wrong from “project management – a systems
