“forum hall” and six generously sized retail slots made it a south side hub for prominent performers powerful politicians parties and partygoers and peddlers and patrons of all persuasionsnat king cole played forum hall captain walter dyett directed the pilgrim baptist church orchestra in it it gave legendary bassist milt hinton his start and provided a key stage for many other jazz greats it hosted the annual convention of the elks soirees of green donkeys and kute kittens beauty contests boxing and everything in between it was an organizing center for the labor movement radical groups and civil rights activistsall the while it provided a range of retail offerings from fresh fruit and vegetables to some of the south side’s best barbecue from ballroom dancing instruction to japanese tea though the dark days of bronzeville silenced the forum it stood tall defying the elements grime and crime and the departure of three quarters of the community’s residentsnow after a four decade hiatus urban juncture is working to bring it back we need the forum to be as before a catalyst for the social political and economic development of bronzevillework has begun we’ve replaced loose

 by  samuelalovecropped from original   challenges in rebuilding bronzeville a chicago case examplethe black metropolischicago’s bronzeville community exemplifies the need for commercial development in poor urban communities bronzeville is a community of roughly  residents located on the southside of chicago bronzeville enjoys a rich history as the “black metropolis” a primary destination point for blacks migrating from the south from the turn of the th century to the ’s and ’s in search of opportunity denied housing elsewhere in the city and with limited access to downtown stores and other opportunities blacks created a vibrant community around a strong local consumerdriven economy and a large number of attractive entertainment venues elliottdonnelly art cc byncsa  by  biverson south

kitchenette apartments lived next to barons of business in lofty mansions ebony magazine soft sheen the chicago defender the supreme life insurance company binga bank and many other black businesses were born in bronzeville in this era culture and the arts flourisheddecline and despairbronzeville’s fortune began to decline in the ’s and ’s with the elimination of restrictive housing covenants middle class blacks followed the broader societal trend to the suburbs at the same time local businesses lost many of their customers to wellcapitalized downtown and suburban competitors that were newly opening their doors to black patrons these trends were worsened by three other key external factorsthe placement of large numbers of publiclysubsidized housing units in bronzeville which brought many additional lowincome residents to the communitydecreased access to opportunityrich communities west of bronzeville due to the building of the dan ryan expressway which acted as an effective barrier andthe overall decline of the chicago economy including the intense difficulties of two major southside industries the stock yards and steel millstogether these forces drove a decadeslong decline of the economic and resident base of the community between  and  bronzeville lost a large portion its residents and housing base most major businesses closed or moved out and virtually all of its quality retail and entertainment venues shut down at one point bronzeville included several of the poorest census tracts in the nationbronzeville’s economic problems persist according to the  us census more than  of bronzeville residents live below the poverty line and roughly  are unemployed moreover a mckinsey  company “deep dive” study performed in conjunction with the grand boulevard federation a group of leading social service agencies and focused on an extended grand boulevard community comprised of nearly half of bronzeville’s residents revealed needs that are even deeper the median household income of grand boulevard families was less than  with over  of households living below the poverty line of  for a family of fourmore than half of the residents of working age are not employed the majority of which are no longer in the workforceless than half the community’s youth graduate from high schoolthe infant mortality rate is almost twice that of the state average and grand boulevard ranks among the  worst in almost every maternal and infant health category of  chicago community areas andcrime is a serious problem with violent crime occurring five times more frequently than in the rest of illinoisbronzeville’s dismal economic condition prompts large human services expenditures the study found that over onequarter of a billion dollars annually is spent to serve an estimated  of grand boulevard’s  residents this funding comes from a number of federal state city and private sources and supports a wide array of services intended to stabilize the community in the turnaround  a place for everyone victory monument  leonard crunellephoto joe ravi cc bysa   via wikimedia commons at the turn of the st century another wave of changes seems set to transform bronzeville the chicago housing authority under its plan for transformation is demolishing all of its galleystyle familyfocused highrise housing developments and investing roughly a billion dollars in bronzeville to replace them with lowrise mixedincome housing meant to blend in with and support the surrounding neighborhoods at the same time a chicagowide housing boom has begun to bring significant numbers of middle class african americans to the community reversing a pattern of outmigration extending for over  decades in aggregate these trends are creating a substantially increased pool of marketrate housing and are likely to attract middleclass residents looking to take advantage of the community’s proximity to downtown and what remains of the gracious centuryold housing stockcommercial and industrial development is required to create local jobs that would help lowerincome residents find an economic footing as well as to provide the basis for the interaction between all residents that is critical to building cohesive communities unfortunately commercial lags far behind residential development the lack of local jobs will make it extremely difficult for longtime residents to remain in the community in the face of rapid gentrification moreover an impending halfbillion dollar reconstruction of the dan ryan expressway threatens to eliminate a dozen ramps further reducing access to jobs and isolating community residents and institutions consequently bronzeville faces the possibility that rather than returning to its latter day role as a commercial and residential haven for people from all walks of life it will become an exclusive refuge for middle and upperclass chicagoans a suburbanstyle bedroom community  minutes from the loop longtime lowerincome residents are likely to be pushed further out the economic margin to southern suburbs that offer even less economic opportunity and access to the regional economy bronzeville may grow but
