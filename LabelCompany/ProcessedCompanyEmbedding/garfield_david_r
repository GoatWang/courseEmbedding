created by jim davis published since  it chronicles the life of the title character the cat garfield jon his owner and jons dog odie as of  it was syndicated in roughly  newspapers and journals and held the guinness world record for being the worlds most widely syndicated comic strip though this is rarely mentioned in print garfield is set in muncie indiana the home of jim davis according to the television special happy birthday garfield common themes in the strip include garfields laziness obsessive eating coffee and disdain of mondays and diets the strips focus is mostly on the interactions among garfield jon and odie but other recurring minor characters appear as well originally created with the intentions to come up with a good marketable character garfield has spawned merchandise earning  million to  billion annually in addition to the various merchandise and commercial tieins the strip has spawned several animated television specials two animated television series two theatrical featurelength liveactioncgi animated films and three fully cgi animated directtovideo movies part of the strips broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of social or political

little success one editor said his art was good his gags were great but that nobody can identify with bugs davis decided to take a long hard look at the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well but there were no cats at the time davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with  cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat he then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created garfield who borrows the first letter of his name from daviss earlier work garfield originally consisted of four main characters garfield the titular character was based on the cats davis was around growing up he took his name and personality from daviss grandfather james a garfield davis who was in daviss words a large cantankerous man jon arbuckle came from a s coffee commercial and odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by davis which featured odie the village idiot early on in the strip odies owner was a man named lyman he was written in to give jon someone to talk with davis later realized that garfield and jon could communicate nonverbally the strip originally centered on jon was first rejected by the king features posthall and the chicago tribunenew york news agencies all of which asked davis to focus on the cat who in their opinion got the better lines united feature syndicate accepted the retooled strip in  and debuted it in  newspapers on june  of that year however after a test run the chicago suntimes dropped it only to reinstate it after readers complaints garfields first sunday page ran on june   being featured as a thirdpager until march   a halfpage debuted the following sunday march  with the strips for march  and   having a unique ninepanel format but ufs curtailed further use of it it did however allow davis to use the format for his us acres strip the appearance of the characters gradually changed over time the left panel is taken from the march   strip the right is from the july   strip the strip underwent stylistic changes evolving from the realistic style of the – strips to a more cartoonish look from  onward this change has mainly affected garfields design which underwent a darwinian evolution in which he began walking on his hind legs slimmed down and stopped looking  through squinty little eyescitation needed his evolution according to davis was to make it easier to push odie off the table or reach for a piece of pie jon also underwent physiological changes he now looks older than in the  strips  he is taller and he has larger features garfield quickly became a commercial success in  less than three years after its release the strip appeared in  newspapers and accumulated over  million in merchandise to manage the merchandise davis founded paws inc

dedicated sites dating from  a site called the garfield randomizer created a threepanel strip using panels from previous garfield strips another approach known as silent garfield involves removing garfields thought balloons from the strips some examples date from  a webcomic called arbuckle does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style the arbuckle website creator writes garfield changes from being a comic about a sassy corpulent feline and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely pathetic delusional man who talks to his pets consider that jon according to garfield canon cannot hear his cats thoughts this is the world as he sees it this is his story another variation along the same lines called realfield or realistic garfield is to redraw garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons still another approach to editing the strips involves removing garfield and other main characters from the originals completely leaving jon talking to himself while strips in this vein can be found online as early as  the  site garfield minus garfield by dan walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media reception was largely positive at its peak the site received as many as  hits per day fans connected with jons loneliness and desperation and found his crazy antics humorous jim davis himself called walshs strips an

many additional characters but the four main ones are described here garfieldedit first appearance june   im not overweight im undertall garfield at large his first book  garfield is an orange fuzzy tabby cat born in the kitchen of an italian restaurant later revealed in the television special garfield his  lives to be mama leonis italian restaurant who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and pizza gags in the strips commonly deal with garfields obesity in one strip jon jokes i wouldnt say garfield is fat but the last time he got on a ferris wheel the two guys on top starved to death and his disdain of any form of exertion or work he is known for saying breathing is exercise in addition to being portrayed as lazy and fat garfield is also pessimistic narcissistic sadistic cynical sarcastic sardonic negative and smug he enjoys destroying things mauling the mailman tormenting odie and kicking odie off the table he also makes snide comments usually about jons inability to get a date in one strip when jon bemoans the fact that no one will go out with him on new years eve garfield replies dont feel bad jon they wouldnt go out with you even if it werent new years though garfield can be very cynical he does have a soft side for his teddy bear pooky food and sleep and one christmas he says they say i have to get up early be nice to people skip breakfast i wish it would never end however in the feature film garfield gets real and its sequels garfield is better behaved friendlier towards jon and odie less selfcentered and more sympathetic it has been wondered by many readers if garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him sometimes it seems like jon can hear him however it is mentioned in more than one strip that jon cannot understand garfield however in the feature film garfield gets real and its sequels garfield and the other animals save for odie are able to talk to and be understood by jon and the other humans in the  april april fools day  strip garfield still with thought balloons can be understood by jon to break the fourth wall  june is celebrated within the strip as garfields birthday the appearance in  claimed it to be his first birthday although in the first appearance of the strip  june  he was portrayed as a fullygrown cat implying that the birthday is of the strip itself garfield learns about his past from his grandfather who makes many jokes about garfield jon arbuckleedit first appearance june   jon heres my sixthgrade report card my parents were so proud garfield reading the report card jon has not shoved any crayons up his nose this term garfield  jon jonathan q arbuckle is garfields owner usually depicted as an awkward clumsy geek who has trouble finding a date jon had a crush on liz garfields veterinarian and is now dating her jon disapproves of garfields dont care not interested attitude and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him sometimes stating an interesting fact or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt garfield into thought garfield tends to brush this off with a simple yet logical remark and despite the trouble garfield causes jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of garfields shortcomings a fact which garfield often takes advantage of in the december   strip jon states that he is thirty years old nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties although he has not aged physically his birthday is july  jon loves or occasionally hates garfield and all cats many gags focus on this his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills his poor taste in clothes garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that two hundred moths committed suicide in another the geek police ordered jon to throw out his tie and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with polka ninjas other strips portray him as lacking intelligence he is seen reading a popup book in one strip jon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities in one strip his father upon seeing indoor plumbing remarks wooha aint science something jon occasionally visits his parents brother and grandmother at their farm it was implied that jon is inspired by a drawing of davis himself when he was first drawing the strip jon was initially portrayed as a cartoonist in earlier strips as jim davis stated this wouldve been a way to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist himself but this eventually faded in the later strips odieedit first appearance august   jon i think im having some kind of identity crisis garfield walking past odie who is lying in a kitchen drawer he thinks hes having an identity crisisodie thinks hes a potato peeler garfield  odie is a yellow longeared beagle with a large slobbering tongue who walks on all four legs though occasionally he will walk on two like garfield he was originally owned by jons friend lyman though jon adopted him after lyman was written out of the strip the book garfield his  lives  retcons odies origin there is no mention of lyman and odie was a puppy when he was acquired by jon as company for garfield when garfield was a kitten odie is usually portrayed as naïve happy affectionate and blissfully unaware of garfields cynical sadistic nature despite the physical abuse garfield exhibits toward him including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself on some occasions however he is depicted more intelligently as one strip in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent garfield from doing this and actually hurts garfields foot in one strip when garfield and jon are out of the house odie is seen reading war and peace and watching a television program an evening with mozart odie has only talked once in another strip published on january   he is seen solving jons sudoku puzzle strips that play off of the size of odies tongue and his inscrutability include one in which garfield remarks is there any wonder why theres no room in his head for a brain and another in which garfield pulls odies tail which results in his tongue being pulled outvolume  issue needed dr liz wilsonedit first appearance june   jon tell me liz havent we met somewhere before a rice paddy in hong kong liz look jerk ill be the vet for your cat but i wont play fall guy for your stupid lines understood jon shocked uhhuh so long doctor liz have a nice day garfield  dr liz wilson is garfields veterinarian and a longtime crush of jon arbuckle she has a somewhat deadpan sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to jons outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion jon often attempted to ask her out on a date but rarely succeeded however in an extended story arc from june  to july   the main event on july  liz and jon kiss now they are a couple liz now frequently visits garfield and jons home often discouraging garfield from eating junk food at the same time garfield is about to do so but he does not listen recurring subjects and themesedit many of the gags focus on garfields obsessive eating and obesity his fear of spiders his hatred of mondays diets and any form of exertion his constant shedding which annoys jon and his abuse of odie and jon as well as his obsession with mailing nermal to abu dhabi or simply throwing through the front door though he will eat nearly anything with the exception of raisins and spinach garfield is particularly fond of lasagna he also enjoys eating jons houseplants and other pets mainly birds and fish he also has odd relationships with household pests garfield generally spares mice and even cooperates with them to cause mischief much to jons chagrin but will readily swat or pound spiders flat other gags focus on jons poor social skills and inability to get a date before he started dating liz he often tried to get dates usually without success in one strip after failing to get a date with nancy he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother he ended up getting shot down by three generations when he does get a date it usually goes awry jons dates have slashed his tires been tranquilized and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears the storylines featuring jons dates rarely appear now before he had dates with many odd characters whereas now he exclusively dates liz garfields world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips like the vets office a place he loathes irmas diner is another occasional setting irma is a chirpy but slowwitted and unattractive waitressmanager and one of jons few friends the terrible food is the center of most of the jokes along with the poor management jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm this results in weeklong comical displays of stupidity by jon and his family and their interactions there is a comic strip where jons brother doc boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and doc boy calls it entertainment on the farm jons mother will cook huge dinners garfield hugs her for this jon has a grandmother who in a strip kicked odie garfield subsequently hugged her jons parents have twice visited jon garfield and odie in the city jons father drove into town on his tractor which he doubleparked and brought a rooster to wake him up as garfield has a love for food they will often eat out at restaurants most trips end up embarrassing because garfield will pig out or jon will do something stupid including wearing an ugly shirt which happened one night when he took liz on a date when jon does take liz on a date garfield occasionally tags alongonce he ate the bread and other food at an italian restaurant they went to frequently the characters break the fourth wall mostly to explain something to the readers talk about a subject that often sets up the strips punchline like jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds garfield in the kitchen and chases him out or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed sometimes this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip for example in one strip garfield catches a cold and complains about it noting i can hardy eben understad by own thoughts short storylinesedit one particular semirecurring storyline features jon and liz on a date in a restaurant they sometimes are waited on by the italian armando who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards jon presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery on other occasions the couple receives a different waiter such as a large ogrelike man who intimidates jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food another commonly recurring character although hardly ever seen is jons neighbor mrs feeny garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her to the point the she even erects an electric fence which of course does not stop him other unique themes are things like garfields believe it or dont garfields law garfields history of dogs and garfields history of cats which show science history and the world from garfields point of view another particular theme is national fat week where garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people also there was a storyline involving garfield catching odie eating his food and kicking odie into next week soon garfield realizes that lunch isnt the same without odie he always slips up behind me barks loudly and makes me fall into my food garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself a few days after the storyline began garfield is lying in his bed with a nagging feeling im forgetting something with odie landing on garfield in the next panel jon and liz began to go out more frequently jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after garfield and odie though they do not always work out two particular examples are lillian an eccentric and very nearsighted old lady with odd quirks and greta a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during new years eve most of december is spent preparing for christmas with a predictable focus on presents other christmas themed strips include jons attempts at decorating the tree and house or the attempt to buy the tree some years the christmas strips started as early as the end of november another example is splut week when garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him for most of garfields history being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia splut hence the name every week before june  the strip focuses on garfields birthday which he dreads because of his fear of getting older this started happening after his sixth birthday however before his th birthday liz put garfield on a diet on june   garfield was given the greatest birthday present im off my diet occasionally the strip celebrates halloween as well with scarythemed jokes such as mask gags there are also seasonal jokes with snowrelated gags common in january or february and beach or heat themed jokes in the summer right panel of october   strip one storyline which ran the week before halloween in  oct  to oct  is unique among garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous it depicts garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists in garfields twentieth anniversary collection in which the strips are reprinted jim davis discusses the genesis for this series during a writing session for halloween i got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips i wanted to scare people and what do people fear most why being alone we carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers reaction ranged from right on to this isnt a trend is it one of the recurring storylines involves garfield getting lost or running away the longest one of these lasted for over a month in  august  to september  it began with jon telling garfield to go get the newspaper garfield walks outside to get it but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off – and decides to find out jon notices garfield has been gone too long so he sends odie out to find him he quickly realizes his mistake odie being not too bright also gets lost jon starts to get lonely so he offers a reward for the return of garfield and odie he is not descriptive so animals including an elephant monkeys a seal a snake a kangaroo and joey and turtles are brought to jons house for the reward after a series of events including odie being adopted by a small girl both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined and both going to a pet shop garfield and odie make it back home another story involved jon going away on a business trip around christmas time leaving garfield a weeks worth of food which he devoured instantly garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out he then reunites with his mother and eventually makes it back home in the snow on christmas eve  december  to  part of this storyline was taken from the  emmywinning special garfield on the town paws incedit paws inc was founded in  by jim davis to support the

veterans day controversyedit the controversial comic strip davis attracted criticism from the mainstream media for a garfield strip in which the last panel appeared to be a negative reference to veterans day that appeared in newspapers on november   in the strip a spider who is about to be squashed by garfield boasts that if he is squished he will get a holiday in his remembrance the next panel shows a classroom of spiders in which a teacher asks the students why spiders celebrate national stupid day implying that the spider was squished davis quickly apologized for the poorly timed comic strip saying that it had been written a year in advance and that both his brother and son were veterans bibliographyedit primary sourcesedit davis jim   years  still kicking garfields twentieth

publishing genres humor garfield is an american comic strip created by jim davis published since  it chronicles the life of the title character the cat garfield jon his owner and jons dog odie as of  it was syndicated in roughly  newspapers and journals and held the guinness world record for being the worlds most widely syndicated comic strip though this is rarely mentioned in print garfield is set in muncie indiana the home of jim davis according to the television special happy birthday garfield common themes in the strip include garfields laziness obsessive eating coffee and disdain of mondays and diets the strips focus is mostly on the interactions among garfield jon and odie but other recurring minor characters appear as well originally created with the intentions to come up with a good marketable character garfield has spawned merchandise earning  million to  billion annually in addition to the various merchandise and commercial tieins the strip has spawned several animated television specials two animated television series two theatrical featurelength liveactioncgi animated films and three fully cgi animated directtovideo movies part of the strips broad pop cultural

comic strip called gnorm gnat which met with little success one editor said his art was good his gags were great but that nobody can identify with bugs davis decided to take a long hard look at the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well but there were no cats at the time davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with  cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat he then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created garfield who borrows the first letter of his name from daviss earlier work garfield originally consisted of four main characters garfield the titular character was based on the cats davis was around growing up he took his name and personality from daviss grandfather james a garfield davis who was in daviss words a large cantankerous man jon arbuckle came from a s coffee commercial and odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by davis which featured odie the village idiot early on in the strip odies owner was a man named lyman he was written in to give jon someone to talk with davis later realized that garfield and jon could communicate nonverbally the strip originally centered on jon was first rejected by the king features posthall and the chicago tribunenew york news agencies all of which asked davis to focus on the cat who in their opinion got the better lines united feature syndicate accepted the retooled strip in  and debuted it in  newspapers on june  of that year however after a test run the chicago suntimes dropped it only to reinstate it after readers complaints garfields first sunday page ran on june   being featured as a thirdpager until march   a halfpage debuted the following sunday march  with the strips for march  and   having a unique ninepanel format but ufs curtailed further use of it it did however allow davis to use the format for his us acres strip the appearance of the characters gradually changed over time the left panel is taken from the march   strip the right is from the july   strip the strip underwent stylistic changes evolving from the realistic style of the – strips to a more cartoonish look from  onward this change has mainly affected garfields design which underwent a darwinian evolution in which he began walking on his hind legs slimmed down and stopped looking  through squinty little eyescitation needed his evolution according to davis was to make it easier to push odie off the table or reach for a piece of pie jon also underwent physiological changes he now looks older than in the  strips  he is taller and he has larger features garfield quickly became a commercial success in  less than three years after its release the strip appeared in  newspapers and accumulated over  million in merchandise to manage the merchandise davis founded paws inc by  garfield became the worlds most syndicated strip appearing in  newspapers with  million readers worldwide by  garfield appeared in nearly  newspapers and sold

hosted on their own unofficial dedicated sites dating from  a site called the garfield randomizer created a threepanel strip using panels from previous garfield strips another approach known as silent garfield involves removing garfields thought balloons from the strips some examples date from  a webcomic called arbuckle does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style the arbuckle website creator writes garfield changes from being a comic about a sassy corpulent feline and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely pathetic delusional man who talks to his pets consider that jon according to garfield canon cannot hear his cats thoughts this is the world as he sees it this is his story another variation along the same lines called realfield or realistic garfield is to redraw garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons still another approach to editing the strips involves removing garfield and other main characters from the originals completely leaving jon talking to himself while strips in this vein can be found online as early as  the  site garfield minus garfield by dan walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media reception was largely positive at its peak the site received as many as  hits per day fans connected with jons loneliness and desperation and found his crazy antics humorous jim davis himself called

many additional characters but the four main ones are described here garfieldedit first appearance june   im not overweight im undertall garfield at large his first book  garfield is an orange fuzzy tabby cat born in the kitchen of an italian restaurant later revealed in the television special garfield his  lives to be mama leonis italian restaurant who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and pizza gags in the strips commonly deal with garfields obesity in one strip jon jokes i wouldnt say garfield is fat but the last time he got on a ferris wheel the two guys on top starved to death and his disdain of any form of exertion or work he is known for saying breathing is exercise in addition to being portrayed as lazy and fat garfield is also pessimistic narcissistic sadistic cynical sarcastic sardonic negative and smug he enjoys destroying things mauling the mailman tormenting odie and kicking odie off the table he also makes snide comments usually about jons inability to get a date in one strip when jon bemoans the fact that no one will go out with him on new years eve garfield replies dont feel bad jon they wouldnt go out with you even if it werent new years though garfield can be very cynical he does have a soft side for his teddy bear pooky food and sleep and one christmas he says they say i have to get up early be nice to people skip breakfast i wish it would never end however in the feature film garfield gets real and its sequels garfield is better behaved friendlier towards jon and odie less selfcentered and more sympathetic it has been wondered by many readers if garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him sometimes it seems like jon can hear him however it is mentioned in more than one strip that jon cannot understand garfield however in the feature film garfield gets real and its sequels garfield and the other animals save for odie are able to talk to and be understood by jon and the other humans in the  april april fools day  strip garfield still with thought balloons can be understood by jon to break the fourth wall  june is celebrated within the strip as garfields birthday the appearance in  claimed it to be his first birthday although in the first appearance of the strip  june  he was portrayed as a fullygrown cat implying that the birthday is of the strip itself garfield learns about his past from his grandfather who makes many jokes about garfield jon arbuckleedit first appearance june   jon heres my sixthgrade report card my parents were so proud garfield reading the report card jon has not shoved any crayons up his nose this term garfield  jon jonathan q arbuckle is garfields owner usually depicted as an awkward clumsy geek who has trouble finding a date jon had a crush on liz garfields veterinarian and is now dating her jon disapproves of garfields dont care not interested attitude and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him sometimes stating an interesting fact or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt garfield into thought garfield tends to brush this off with a simple yet logical remark and despite the trouble garfield causes jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of garfields shortcomings a fact which garfield often takes advantage of in the december   strip jon states that he is thirty years old nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties although he has not aged physically his birthday is july  jon loves or occasionally hates garfield and all cats many gags focus on this his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills his poor taste in clothes garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that two hundred moths committed suicide in another the geek police ordered jon to throw out his tie and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with polka ninjas other strips portray him as lacking intelligence he is seen reading a popup book in one strip jon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities in one strip his father upon seeing indoor plumbing remarks wooha aint science something jon occasionally visits his parents brother and grandmother at their farm it was implied that jon is inspired by a drawing of davis himself when he was first drawing the strip jon was initially portrayed as a cartoonist in earlier strips as jim davis stated this wouldve been a way to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist himself but this eventually faded in the later strips odieedit first appearance august   jon i think im having some kind of identity crisis garfield walking past odie who is lying in a kitchen drawer he thinks hes having an identity crisisodie thinks hes a potato peeler garfield  odie is a yellow longeared beagle with a large slobbering tongue who walks on all four legs though occasionally he will walk on two like garfield he was originally owned by jons friend lyman though jon adopted him after lyman was written out of the strip the book garfield his  lives  retcons odies origin there is no mention of lyman and odie was a puppy when he was acquired by jon as company for garfield when garfield was a kitten odie is usually portrayed as naïve happy affectionate and blissfully unaware of garfields cynical sadistic nature despite the physical abuse garfield exhibits toward him including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself on some occasions however he is depicted more intelligently as one strip in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent garfield from doing this and actually hurts garfields foot in one strip when garfield and jon are out of the house odie is seen reading war and peace and watching a television program an evening with mozart odie has only talked once in another strip published on january   he is seen solving jons sudoku puzzle strips that play off of the size of odies tongue and his inscrutability include one in which garfield remarks is there any wonder why theres no room in his head for a brain and another in which garfield pulls odies tail which results in his tongue being pulled outvolume  issue needed dr liz wilsonedit first appearance june   jon tell me liz havent we met somewhere before a rice paddy in hong kong liz look jerk ill be the vet for your cat but i wont play fall guy for your stupid lines understood jon shocked uhhuh so long doctor liz have a nice day garfield  dr liz wilson is garfields veterinarian and a longtime crush of jon arbuckle she has a somewhat deadpan sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to jons outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion jon often attempted to ask her out on a date but rarely succeeded however in an extended story arc from june  to july   the main event on july  liz and jon kiss now they are a couple liz now frequently visits garfield and jons home often discouraging garfield from eating junk food at the same time garfield is about to do so but he does not listen recurring subjects and themesedit many of the gags focus on garfields obsessive eating and obesity his fear of spiders his hatred of mondays diets and any form of exertion his constant shedding which annoys jon and his abuse of odie and jon as well as his obsession with mailing nermal to abu dhabi or simply throwing through the front door though he will eat nearly anything with the exception of raisins and spinach garfield is particularly fond of lasagna he also enjoys eating jons houseplants and other pets mainly birds and fish he also has odd relationships with household pests garfield generally spares mice and even cooperates with them to cause mischief much to jons chagrin but will readily swat or pound spiders flat other gags focus on jons poor social skills and inability to get a date before he started dating liz he often tried to get dates usually without success in one strip after failing to get a date with nancy he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother he ended up getting shot down by three generations when he does get a date it usually goes awry jons dates have slashed his tires been tranquilized and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears the storylines featuring jons dates rarely appear now before he had dates with many odd characters whereas now he exclusively dates liz garfields world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips like the vets office a place he loathes irmas diner is another occasional setting irma is a chirpy but slowwitted and unattractive waitressmanager and one of jons few friends the terrible food is the center of most of the jokes along with the poor management jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm this results in weeklong comical displays of stupidity by jon and his family and their interactions there is a comic strip where jons brother doc boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and doc boy calls it entertainment on the farm jons mother will cook huge dinners garfield hugs her for this jon has a grandmother who in a strip kicked odie garfield subsequently hugged her jons parents have twice visited jon garfield and odie in the city jons father drove into town on his tractor which he doubleparked and brought a rooster to wake him up as garfield has a love for food they will often eat out at restaurants most trips end up embarrassing because garfield will pig out or jon will do something stupid including wearing an ugly shirt which happened one night when he took liz on a date when jon does take liz on a date garfield occasionally tags alongonce he ate the bread and other food at an italian restaurant they went to frequently the characters break the fourth wall mostly to explain something to the readers talk about a subject that often sets up the strips punchline like jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds garfield in the kitchen and chases him out or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed sometimes this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip for example in one strip garfield catches a cold and complains about it noting i can hardy eben understad by own thoughts short storylinesedit one particular semirecurring storyline features jon and liz on a date in a restaurant they sometimes are waited on by the italian armando who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards jon presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery on other occasions the couple receives a different waiter such as a large ogrelike man who intimidates jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food another commonly recurring character although hardly ever seen is jons neighbor mrs feeny garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her to the point the she even erects an electric fence which of course does not stop him other unique themes are things like garfields believe it or dont garfields law garfields history of dogs and garfields history of cats which show science history and the world from garfields point of view another particular theme is national fat week where garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people also there was a storyline involving garfield catching odie eating his food and kicking odie into next week soon garfield realizes that lunch isnt the same without odie he always slips up behind me barks loudly and makes me fall into my food garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself a few days after the storyline began garfield is lying in his bed with a nagging feeling im forgetting something with odie landing on garfield in the next panel jon and liz began to go out more frequently jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after garfield and odie though they do not always work out two particular examples are lillian an eccentric and very nearsighted old lady with odd quirks and greta a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during new years eve most of december is spent preparing for christmas with a predictable focus on presents other christmas themed strips include jons attempts at decorating the tree and house or the attempt to buy the tree some years the christmas strips started as early as the end of november another example is splut week when garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him for most of garfields history being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia splut hence the name every week before june  the strip focuses on garfields birthday which he dreads because of his fear of getting older this started happening after his sixth birthday however before his th birthday liz put garfield on a diet on june   garfield was given the greatest birthday present im off my diet occasionally the strip celebrates halloween as well with scarythemed jokes such as mask gags there are also seasonal jokes with snowrelated gags common in january or february and beach or heat themed jokes in the summer right panel of october   strip one storyline which ran the week before halloween in  oct  to oct  is unique among garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous it depicts garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists in garfields twentieth anniversary collection in which the strips are reprinted jim davis discusses the genesis for this series during a writing session for halloween i got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips i wanted to scare people and what do people fear most why being alone we carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers reaction ranged from right on to this isnt a trend is it one of the recurring storylines involves garfield getting lost or running away the longest one of these lasted for over a month in  august  to september  it began with jon telling garfield to go get the newspaper garfield walks outside to get it but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off – and decides to find out jon notices garfield has been gone too long so he sends odie out to find him he quickly realizes his mistake odie being not too bright also gets lost jon starts to get lonely so he offers a reward for the return of garfield and odie he is not descriptive so animals including an elephant monkeys a seal a snake a kangaroo and joey and turtles are brought to jons house for the reward after a series of events including odie being adopted by a

publishing genres humor garfield is an american comic strip created by jim davis published since  it chronicles the life of the title character the cat garfield jon his owner and jons dog odie as of  it was syndicated in roughly  newspapers and journals and held the guinness world record for being the worlds most widely syndicated comic strip though this is rarely mentioned in print garfield is set in muncie indiana the home of jim davis according to the television special happy birthday garfield common themes in the strip include garfields laziness obsessive eating coffee and disdain of mondays and diets the strips focus is mostly on the interactions among garfield jon and odie but other recurring minor characters appear as well originally created with the intentions to come up with a good marketable character garfield has spawned merchandise earning  million to  billion annually in addition to the various merchandise and commercial tieins the strip has spawned several animated television specials two animated television series two theatrical featurelength liveactioncgi animated films and three fully cgi animated directtovideo movies part of the strips broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of social or political commentary though this was daviss original intention he also admitted that his grasp of politics isnt strong joking that for many years he thought opec

comic strip called gnorm gnat which met with little success one editor said his art was good his gags were great but that nobody can identify with bugs davis decided to take a long hard look at the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well but there were no cats at the time davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with  cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat he then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created garfield who borrows the first letter of his name from daviss earlier work garfield originally consisted of four main characters garfield the titular character was based on the cats davis was around growing up he took his name and personality from daviss grandfather james a garfield davis who was in daviss words a large cantankerous man jon arbuckle came from a s coffee commercial and odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by davis which featured odie the village idiot early on in the strip odies owner was a man named lyman he was written in to give jon someone to talk with davis later realized that garfield and jon could communicate nonverbally the strip originally centered on jon was first rejected by the king features posthall and the chicago tribunenew york news agencies all of which asked davis to focus on the cat who in their opinion got the better lines united feature syndicate accepted the retooled strip in  and debuted it in  newspapers on june  of that year however after a test run the chicago suntimes dropped it only to reinstate it after readers complaints garfields first sunday page ran on june   being featured as a thirdpager until march   a halfpage debuted the following sunday march  with the strips for march  and   having a unique ninepanel format but ufs curtailed further use of it it did however allow davis to use the format for his us acres strip the appearance of the characters gradually changed over time the left panel is taken from the march   strip the right is from the july   strip the strip underwent stylistic changes evolving from the realistic style of the – strips to a more cartoonish look from  onward this change has mainly affected garfields design which underwent a darwinian evolution in which he began walking on his hind legs slimmed down and stopped looking  through squinty little eyescitation needed his evolution according to davis was to make it easier to push odie off the table or reach for a piece of pie jon also underwent physiological changes he now looks older than in the  strips  he is taller and he has larger features garfield quickly became a commercial success in  less than three years after its release the strip appeared in  newspapers and accumulated over  million in merchandise to manage the merchandise davis founded paws inc by  garfield became the worlds most syndicated strip appearing in  newspapers with  million readers worldwide by  garfield appeared in nearly  newspapers and sold

hosted on their own unofficial dedicated sites dating from  a site called the garfield randomizer created a threepanel strip using panels from previous garfield strips another approach known as silent garfield involves removing garfields thought balloons from the strips some examples date from  a webcomic called arbuckle does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style the arbuckle website creator writes garfield changes from being a comic about a sassy corpulent feline and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely pathetic delusional man who talks to his pets consider that jon according to garfield canon cannot hear his cats thoughts this is the world as he sees it this is his story another variation along the same lines called realfield or realistic garfield is to redraw garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons still another approach to editing the strips involves removing garfield and other main characters from the originals completely leaving jon talking to himself while strips in this vein can be found online as early as  the  site garfield minus garfield by dan walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media reception was largely positive at its peak the site received as many as  hits per day fans connected with jons loneliness and desperation and found his crazy antics humorous jim davis himself called

many additional characters but the four main ones are described here garfieldedit first appearance june   im not overweight im undertall garfield at large his first book  garfield is an orange fuzzy tabby cat born in the kitchen of an italian restaurant later revealed in the television special garfield his  lives to be mama leonis italian restaurant who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and pizza gags in the strips commonly deal with garfields obesity in one strip jon jokes i wouldnt say garfield is fat but the last time he got on a ferris wheel the two guys on top starved to death and his disdain of any form of exertion or work he is known for saying breathing is exercise in addition to being portrayed as lazy and fat garfield is also pessimistic narcissistic sadistic cynical sarcastic sardonic negative and smug he enjoys destroying things mauling the mailman tormenting odie and kicking odie off the table he also makes snide comments usually about jons inability to get a date in one strip when jon bemoans the fact that no one will go out with him on new years eve garfield replies dont feel bad jon they wouldnt go out with you even if it werent new years though garfield can be very cynical he does have a soft side for his teddy bear pooky food and sleep and one christmas he says they say i have to get up early be nice to people skip breakfast i wish it would never end however in the feature film garfield gets real and its sequels garfield is better behaved friendlier towards jon and odie less selfcentered and more sympathetic it has been wondered by many readers if garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him sometimes it seems like jon can hear him however it is mentioned in more than one strip that jon cannot understand garfield however in the feature film garfield gets real and its sequels garfield and the other animals save for odie are able to talk to and be understood by jon and the other humans in the  april april fools day  strip garfield still with thought balloons can be understood by jon to break the fourth wall  june is celebrated within the strip as garfields birthday the appearance in  claimed it to be his first birthday although in the first appearance of the strip  june  he was portrayed as a fullygrown cat implying that the birthday is of the strip itself garfield learns about his past from his grandfather who makes many jokes about garfield jon arbuckleedit first appearance june   jon heres my sixthgrade report card my parents were so proud garfield reading the report card jon has not shoved any crayons up his nose this term garfield  jon jonathan q arbuckle is garfields owner usually depicted as an awkward clumsy geek who has trouble finding a date jon had a crush on liz garfields veterinarian and is now dating her jon disapproves of garfields dont care not interested attitude and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him sometimes stating an interesting fact or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt garfield into thought garfield tends to brush this off with a simple yet logical remark and despite the trouble garfield causes jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of garfields shortcomings a fact which garfield often takes advantage of in the december   strip jon states that he is thirty years old nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties although he has not aged physically his birthday is july  jon loves or occasionally hates garfield and all cats many gags focus on this his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills his poor taste in clothes garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that two hundred moths committed suicide in another the geek police ordered jon to throw out his tie and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with polka ninjas other strips portray him as lacking intelligence he is seen reading a popup book in one strip jon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities in one strip his father upon seeing indoor plumbing remarks wooha aint science something jon occasionally visits his parents brother and grandmother at their farm it was implied that jon is inspired by a drawing of davis himself when he was first drawing the strip jon was initially portrayed as a cartoonist in earlier strips as jim davis stated this wouldve been a way to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist himself but this eventually faded in the later strips odieedit first appearance august   jon i think im having some kind of identity crisis garfield walking past odie who is lying in a kitchen drawer he thinks hes having an identity crisisodie thinks hes a potato peeler garfield  odie is a yellow longeared beagle with a large slobbering tongue who walks on all four legs though occasionally he will walk on two like garfield he was originally owned by jons friend lyman though jon adopted him after lyman was written out of the strip the book garfield his  lives  retcons odies origin there is no mention of lyman and odie was a puppy when he was acquired by jon as company for garfield when garfield was a kitten odie is usually portrayed as naïve happy affectionate and blissfully unaware of garfields cynical sadistic nature despite the physical abuse garfield exhibits toward him including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself on some occasions however he is depicted more intelligently as one strip in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent garfield from doing this and actually hurts garfields foot in one strip when garfield and jon are out of the house odie is seen reading war and peace and watching a television program an evening with mozart odie has only talked once in another strip published on january   he is seen solving jons sudoku puzzle strips that play off of the size of odies tongue and his inscrutability include one in which garfield remarks is there any wonder why theres no room in his head for a brain and another in which garfield pulls odies tail which results in his tongue being pulled outvolume  issue needed dr liz wilsonedit first appearance june   jon tell me liz havent we met somewhere before a rice paddy in hong kong liz look jerk ill be the vet for your cat but i wont play fall guy for your stupid lines understood jon shocked uhhuh so long doctor liz have a nice day garfield  dr liz wilson is garfields veterinarian and a longtime crush of jon arbuckle she has a somewhat deadpan sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to jons outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion jon often attempted to ask her out on a date but rarely succeeded however in an extended story arc from june  to july   the main event on july  liz and jon kiss now they are a couple liz now frequently visits garfield and jons home often discouraging garfield from eating junk food at the same time garfield is about to do so but he does not listen recurring subjects and themesedit many of the gags focus on garfields obsessive eating and obesity his fear of spiders his hatred of mondays diets and any form of exertion his constant shedding which annoys jon and his abuse of odie and jon as well as his obsession with mailing nermal to abu dhabi or simply throwing through the front door though he will eat nearly anything with the exception of raisins and spinach garfield is particularly fond of lasagna he also enjoys eating jons houseplants and other pets mainly birds and fish he also has odd relationships with household pests garfield generally spares mice and even cooperates with them to cause mischief much to jons chagrin but will readily swat or pound spiders flat other gags focus on jons poor social skills and inability to get a date before he started dating liz he often tried to get dates usually without success in one strip after failing to get a date with nancy he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother he ended up getting shot down by three generations when he does get a date it usually goes awry jons dates have slashed his tires been tranquilized and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears the storylines featuring jons dates rarely appear now before he had dates with many odd characters whereas now he exclusively dates liz garfields world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips like the vets office a place he loathes irmas diner is another occasional setting irma is a chirpy but slowwitted and unattractive waitressmanager and one of jons few friends the terrible food is the center of most of the jokes along with the poor management jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm this results in weeklong comical displays of stupidity by jon and his family and their interactions there is a comic strip where jons brother doc boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and doc boy calls it entertainment on the farm jons mother will cook huge dinners garfield hugs her for this jon has a grandmother who in a strip kicked odie garfield subsequently hugged her jons parents have twice visited jon garfield and odie in the city jons father drove into town on his tractor which he doubleparked and brought a rooster to wake him up as garfield has a love for food they will often eat out at restaurants most trips end up embarrassing because garfield will pig out or jon will do something stupid including wearing an ugly shirt which happened one night when he took liz on a date when jon does take liz on a date garfield occasionally tags alongonce he ate the bread and other food at an italian restaurant they went to frequently the characters break the fourth wall mostly to explain something to the readers talk about a subject that often sets up the strips punchline like jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds garfield in the kitchen and chases him out or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed sometimes this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip for example in one strip garfield catches a cold and complains about it noting i can hardy eben understad by own thoughts short storylinesedit one particular semirecurring storyline features jon and liz on a date in a restaurant they sometimes are waited on by the italian armando who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards jon presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery on other occasions the couple receives a different waiter such as a large ogrelike man who intimidates jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food another commonly recurring character although hardly ever seen is jons neighbor mrs feeny garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her to the point the she even erects an electric fence which of course does not stop him other unique themes are things like garfields believe it or dont garfields law garfields history of dogs and garfields history of cats which show science history and the world from garfields point of view another particular theme is national fat week where garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people also there was a storyline involving garfield catching odie eating his food and kicking odie into next week soon garfield realizes that lunch isnt the same without odie he always slips up behind me barks loudly and makes me fall into my food garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself a few days after the storyline began garfield is lying in his bed with a nagging feeling im forgetting something with odie landing on garfield in the next panel jon and liz began to go out more frequently jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after garfield and odie though they do not always work out two particular examples are lillian an eccentric and very nearsighted old lady with odd quirks and greta a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during new years eve most of december is spent preparing for christmas with a predictable focus on presents other christmas themed strips include jons attempts at decorating the tree and house or the attempt to buy the tree some years the christmas strips started as early as the end of november another example is splut week when garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him for most of garfields history being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia splut hence the name every week before june  the strip focuses on garfields birthday which he dreads because of his fear of getting older this started happening after his sixth birthday however before his th birthday liz put garfield on a diet on june   garfield was given the greatest birthday present im off my diet occasionally the strip celebrates halloween as well with scarythemed jokes such as mask gags there are also seasonal jokes with snowrelated gags common in january or february and beach or heat themed jokes in the summer right panel of october   strip one storyline which ran the week before halloween in  oct  to oct  is unique among garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous it depicts garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists in garfields twentieth anniversary collection in which the strips are reprinted jim davis discusses the genesis for this series during a writing session for halloween i got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips i wanted to scare people and what do people fear most why being alone we carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers reaction ranged from right on to this isnt a trend is it one of the recurring storylines involves garfield getting lost or running away the longest one of these lasted for over a month in  august  to september  it began with jon telling garfield to go get the newspaper garfield walks outside to get it but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off – and decides to find out jon notices garfield has been gone too long so he sends odie out to find him he quickly realizes his mistake odie being not too bright also gets lost jon starts to get lonely so he offers a reward for the return of garfield and odie he is not descriptive so animals including an elephant monkeys a seal a snake a kangaroo and joey and turtles are brought to jons house for the reward after a series of events including odie being adopted by a small girl both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined and both going to a pet shop garfield and odie make it back home another story involved jon going away on a business trip around christmas time leaving garfield a weeks worth of food which he devoured instantly garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out he then reunites with his mother and eventually makes it back home in the snow on christmas eve  december  to  part of this storyline was taken from the  emmywinning special garfield on the town paws incedit paws inc was founded in  by jim davis to support the

veterans day controversyedit the controversial comic strip davis attracted criticism from the mainstream media for a garfield strip in which the last panel appeared to be a negative reference to veterans day that appeared in newspapers on november   in the strip a spider who is about to be squashed by garfield boasts that if he is squished he will get a holiday in his remembrance the next panel shows a classroom of spiders in which a teacher asks the students why spiders celebrate national stupid day implying that the spider was squished davis quickly apologized for the poorly timed comic strip saying that it had been written a year in advance and that both his brother and son were veterans bibliographyedit primary sourcesedit davis jim   years  still kicking garfields twentieth

publishing genres humor garfield is an american comic strip created by jim davis published since  it chronicles the life of the title character the cat garfield jon his owner and jons dog odie as of  it was syndicated in roughly  newspapers and journals and held the guinness world record for being the worlds most widely syndicated comic strip though this is rarely mentioned in print garfield is set in muncie indiana the home of jim davis according to the television special happy birthday garfield common themes in the strip include garfields laziness obsessive eating coffee and disdain of mondays and diets the strips focus is mostly on the interactions among garfield jon and odie but other recurring minor characters appear as well originally created with the intentions to come up with a good marketable character garfield has spawned merchandise earning  million to  billion annually in addition to the various merchandise and commercial tieins the strip has spawned several animated television specials two animated television series two theatrical featurelength liveactioncgi animated films and three fully cgi animated directtovideo movies part of the strips broad pop cultural

comic strip called gnorm gnat which met with little success one editor said his art was good his gags were great but that nobody can identify with bugs davis decided to take a long hard look at the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well but there were no cats at the time davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with  cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat he then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created garfield who borrows the first letter of his name from daviss earlier work garfield originally consisted of four main characters garfield the titular character was based on the cats davis was around growing up he took his name and personality from daviss grandfather james a garfield davis who was in daviss words a large cantankerous man jon arbuckle came from a s coffee commercial and odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by davis which featured odie the village idiot early on in the strip odies owner was a man named lyman he was written in to give jon someone to talk with davis later realized that garfield and jon could communicate nonverbally the strip originally centered on jon was first rejected by the king features posthall and the chicago tribunenew york news agencies all of which asked davis to focus on the cat who in their opinion got the better lines united feature syndicate accepted the retooled strip in  and debuted it in  newspapers on june  of that year however after a test run the chicago suntimes dropped it only to reinstate it after readers complaints garfields first sunday page ran on june   being featured as a thirdpager until march   a halfpage debuted the following sunday march  with the strips for march  and   having a unique ninepanel format but ufs curtailed further use of it it did however allow davis to use the format for his us acres strip the appearance of the characters gradually changed over time the left panel is taken from the march   strip the right is from the july   strip the strip underwent stylistic changes evolving from the realistic style of the – strips to a more cartoonish look from  onward this change has mainly affected garfields design which underwent a darwinian evolution in which he began walking on his hind legs slimmed down and stopped looking  through squinty little eyescitation needed his evolution according to davis was to make it easier to push odie off the table or reach for a piece of pie jon also underwent physiological changes he now looks older than in the  strips  he is taller and he has larger features garfield quickly became a commercial success in  less than three years after its release the strip appeared in  newspapers and accumulated over  million in merchandise to manage the merchandise davis founded paws inc by  garfield became the worlds most syndicated strip appearing in  newspapers with  million readers worldwide by  garfield appeared in nearly  newspapers and sold

garfield involves removing garfields thought balloons from the strips some examples date from  a webcomic called arbuckle does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style the arbuckle website creator writes garfield changes from being a comic about a sassy corpulent feline and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely pathetic delusional man who talks to his pets consider that jon according to garfield canon cannot hear his cats thoughts this is the world as he sees it this is his story another variation along the same lines called realfield or realistic garfield is to redraw garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons still another approach to editing the strips involves removing garfield and other main characters from the originals completely leaving jon talking to himself while strips in this vein can be found online as early as  the  site garfield minus garfield by dan walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media reception was largely positive at its peak the site received as many as  hits per day fans connected with jons loneliness and desperation and found his crazy antics humorous jim davis himself called

many additional characters but the four main ones are described here garfieldedit first appearance june   im not overweight im undertall garfield at large his first book  garfield is an orange fuzzy tabby cat born in the kitchen of an italian restaurant later revealed in the television special garfield his  lives to be mama leonis italian restaurant who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and pizza gags in the strips commonly deal with garfields obesity in one strip jon jokes i wouldnt say garfield is fat but the last time he got on a ferris wheel the two guys on top starved to death and his disdain of any form of exertion or work he is known for saying breathing is exercise in addition to being portrayed as lazy and fat garfield is also pessimistic narcissistic sadistic cynical sarcastic sardonic negative and smug he enjoys destroying things mauling the mailman tormenting odie and kicking odie off the table he also makes snide comments usually about jons inability to get a date in one strip when jon bemoans the fact that no one will go out with him on new years eve garfield replies dont feel bad jon they wouldnt go out with you even if it werent new years though garfield can be very cynical he does have a soft side for his teddy bear pooky food and sleep and one christmas he says they say i have to get up early be nice to people skip breakfast i wish it would never end however in the feature film garfield gets real and its sequels garfield is better behaved friendlier towards jon and odie less selfcentered and more sympathetic it has been wondered by many readers if garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him sometimes it seems like jon can hear him however it is mentioned in more than one strip that jon cannot understand garfield however in the feature film garfield gets real and its sequels garfield and the other animals save for odie are able to talk to and be understood by jon and the other humans in the  april april fools day  strip garfield still with thought balloons can be understood by jon to break the fourth wall  june is celebrated within the strip as garfields birthday the appearance in  claimed it to be his first birthday although in the first appearance of the strip  june  he was portrayed as a fullygrown cat implying that the birthday is of the strip itself garfield learns about his past from his grandfather who makes many jokes about garfield jon arbuckleedit first appearance june   jon heres my sixthgrade report card my parents were so proud garfield reading the report card jon has not shoved any crayons up his nose this term garfield  jon jonathan q arbuckle is garfields owner usually depicted as an awkward clumsy geek who has trouble finding a date jon had a crush on liz garfields veterinarian and is now dating her jon disapproves of garfields dont care not interested attitude and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him sometimes stating an interesting fact or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt garfield into thought garfield tends to brush this off with a simple yet logical remark and despite the trouble garfield causes jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of garfields shortcomings a fact which garfield often takes advantage of in the december   strip jon states that he is thirty years old nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties although he has not aged physically his birthday is july  jon loves or occasionally hates garfield and all cats many gags focus on this his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills his poor taste in clothes garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that two hundred moths committed suicide in another the geek police ordered jon to throw out his tie and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with polka ninjas other strips portray him as lacking intelligence he is seen reading a popup book in one strip jon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities in one strip his father upon seeing indoor plumbing remarks wooha aint science something jon occasionally visits his parents brother and grandmother at their farm it was implied that jon is inspired by a drawing of davis himself when he was first drawing the strip jon was initially portrayed as a cartoonist in earlier strips as jim davis stated this wouldve been a way to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist himself but this eventually faded in the later strips odieedit first appearance august   jon i think im having some kind of identity crisis garfield walking past odie who is lying in a kitchen drawer he thinks hes having an identity crisisodie thinks hes a potato peeler garfield  odie is a yellow longeared beagle with a large slobbering tongue who walks on all four legs though occasionally he will walk on two like garfield he was originally owned by jons friend lyman though jon adopted him after lyman was written out of the strip the book garfield his  lives  retcons odies origin there is no mention of lyman and odie was a puppy when he was acquired by jon as company for garfield when garfield was a kitten odie is usually portrayed as naïve happy affectionate and blissfully unaware of garfields cynical sadistic nature despite the physical abuse garfield exhibits toward him including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself on some occasions however he is depicted more intelligently as one strip in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent garfield from doing this and actually hurts garfields foot in one strip when garfield and jon are out of the house odie is seen reading war and peace and watching a television program an evening with mozart odie has only talked once in another strip published on january   he is seen solving jons sudoku puzzle strips that play off of the size of odies tongue and his inscrutability include one in which garfield remarks is there any wonder why theres no room in his head for a brain and another in which garfield pulls odies tail which results in his tongue being pulled outvolume  issue needed dr liz wilsonedit first appearance june   jon tell me liz havent we met somewhere before a rice paddy in hong kong liz look jerk ill be the vet for your cat but i wont play fall guy for your stupid lines understood jon shocked uhhuh so long doctor liz have a nice day garfield  dr liz wilson is garfields veterinarian and a longtime crush of jon arbuckle she has a somewhat deadpan sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to jons outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion jon often attempted to ask her out on a date but rarely succeeded however in an extended story arc from june  to july   the main event on july  liz and jon kiss now they are a couple liz now frequently visits garfield and jons home often discouraging garfield from eating junk food at the same time garfield is about to do so but he does not listen recurring subjects and themesedit many of the gags focus on garfields obsessive eating and obesity his fear of spiders his hatred of mondays diets and any form of exertion his constant shedding which annoys jon and his abuse of odie and jon as well as his obsession with mailing nermal to abu dhabi or simply throwing through the front door though he will eat nearly anything with the exception of raisins and spinach garfield is particularly fond of lasagna he also enjoys eating jons houseplants and other pets mainly birds and fish he also has odd relationships with household pests garfield generally spares mice and even cooperates with them to cause mischief much to jons chagrin but will readily swat or pound spiders flat other gags focus on jons poor social skills and inability to get a date before he started dating liz he often tried to get dates usually without success in one strip after failing to get a date with nancy he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother he ended up getting shot down by three generations when he does get a date it usually goes awry jons dates have slashed his tires been tranquilized and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears the storylines featuring jons dates rarely appear now before he had dates with many odd characters whereas now he exclusively dates liz garfields world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips like the vets office a place he loathes irmas diner is another occasional setting irma is a chirpy but slowwitted and unattractive waitressmanager and one of jons few friends the terrible food is the center of most of the jokes along with the poor management jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm this results in weeklong comical displays of stupidity by jon and his family and their interactions there is a comic strip where jons brother doc boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and doc boy calls it entertainment on the farm jons mother will cook huge dinners garfield hugs her for this jon has a grandmother who in a strip kicked odie garfield subsequently hugged her jons parents have twice visited jon garfield and odie in the city jons father drove into town on his tractor which he doubleparked and brought a rooster to wake him up as garfield has a love for food they will often eat out at restaurants most trips end up embarrassing because garfield will pig out or jon will do something stupid including wearing an ugly shirt which happened one night when he took liz on a date when jon does take liz on a date garfield occasionally tags alongonce he ate the bread and other food at an italian restaurant they went to frequently the characters break the fourth wall mostly to explain something to the readers talk about a subject that often sets up the strips punchline like jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds garfield in the kitchen and chases him out or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed sometimes this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip for example in one strip garfield catches a cold and complains about it noting i can hardy eben understad by own thoughts short storylinesedit one particular semirecurring storyline features jon and liz on a date in a restaurant they sometimes are waited on by the italian armando who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards jon presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery on other occasions the couple receives a different waiter such as a large ogrelike man who intimidates jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food another commonly recurring character although hardly ever seen is jons neighbor mrs feeny garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her to the point the she even erects an electric fence which of course does not stop him other unique themes are things like garfields believe it or dont garfields law garfields history of dogs and garfields history of cats which show science history and the world from garfields point of view another particular theme is national fat week where garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people also there was a storyline involving garfield catching odie eating his food and kicking odie into next week soon garfield realizes that lunch isnt the same without odie he always slips up behind me barks loudly and makes me fall into my food garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself a few days after the storyline began garfield is lying in his bed with a nagging feeling im forgetting something with odie landing on garfield in the next panel jon and liz began to go out more frequently jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after garfield and odie though they do not always work out two particular examples are lillian an eccentric and very nearsighted old lady with odd quirks and greta a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during new years eve most of december is spent preparing for christmas with a predictable focus on presents other christmas themed strips include jons attempts at decorating the tree and house or the attempt to buy the tree some years the christmas strips started as early as the end of november another example is splut week when garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him for most of garfields history being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia splut hence the name every week before june  the strip focuses on garfields birthday which he dreads because of his fear of getting older this started happening after his sixth birthday however before his th birthday liz put garfield on a diet on june   garfield was given the greatest birthday present im off my diet occasionally the strip celebrates halloween as well with scarythemed jokes such as mask gags there are also seasonal jokes with snowrelated gags common in january or february and beach or heat themed jokes in the summer right panel of october   strip one storyline which ran the week before halloween in  oct  to oct  is unique among garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous it depicts garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists in garfields twentieth anniversary collection in which the strips are reprinted jim davis discusses the genesis for this series during a writing session for halloween i got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips i wanted to scare people and what do people fear most why being alone we carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers reaction ranged from right on to this isnt a trend is it one of the recurring storylines involves garfield getting lost or running away the longest one of these lasted for over a month in  august  to september  it began with jon telling garfield to go get the newspaper garfield walks outside to get it but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off – and decides to find out jon notices garfield has been gone too long so he sends odie out to find him he quickly realizes his mistake odie being not too bright also gets lost jon starts to get lonely so he offers a reward for the return of garfield and odie he is not descriptive so animals including an elephant monkeys a seal a snake a kangaroo and joey and turtles are brought to jons house for the reward after a series of events including odie being adopted by a small girl both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined and both going to a pet shop garfield and odie make it back home another story involved jon going away on a business trip around christmas time leaving garfield a weeks worth of food which he devoured instantly garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out he then reunites with his mother and eventually makes it back home in the snow on christmas eve  december  to  part of this storyline was taken from the  emmywinning special garfield on the town paws incedit paws inc was founded in  by jim davis to support the

veterans day controversyedit the controversial comic strip davis attracted criticism from the mainstream media for a garfield strip in which the last panel appeared to be a negative reference to veterans day that appeared in newspapers on november   in the strip a spider who is about to be squashed by garfield boasts that if he is squished he will get a holiday in his remembrance the next panel shows a classroom of spiders in which a teacher asks the students why spiders celebrate national stupid day implying that the spider was squished davis quickly apologized for the poorly timed comic strip saying that it had been written a year in advance and that both his brother and son were veterans bibliographyedit primary sourcesedit davis jim   years  still kicking garfields twentieth

publishing genres humor garfield is an american comic strip created by jim davis published since  it chronicles the life of the title character the cat garfield jon his owner and jons dog odie as of  it was syndicated in roughly  newspapers and journals and held the guinness world record for being the worlds most widely syndicated comic strip though this is rarely mentioned in print garfield is set in muncie indiana the home of jim davis according to the television special happy birthday garfield common themes in the strip include garfields laziness obsessive eating coffee and disdain of mondays and diets the strips focus is mostly on the interactions among garfield jon and odie but other recurring minor characters appear as well originally created with the intentions to come up with a good marketable character garfield has spawned merchandise earning  million to  billion annually in addition to the various merchandise and commercial tieins the strip has spawned several animated television specials two animated television series two theatrical featurelength liveactioncgi animated films and three fully cgi animated directtovideo movies part of the strips broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of social or political commentary though this was daviss original intention he also admitted that his grasp of politics isnt strong joking that for many years he thought opec

comic strip called gnorm gnat which met with little success one editor said his art was good his gags were great but that nobody can identify with bugs davis decided to take a long hard look at the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well but there were no cats at the time davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with  cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat he then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created garfield who borrows the first letter of his name from daviss earlier work garfield originally consisted of four main characters garfield the titular character was based on the cats davis was around growing up he took his name and personality from daviss grandfather james a garfield davis who was in daviss words a large cantankerous man jon arbuckle came from a s coffee commercial and odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by davis which featured odie the village idiot early on in the strip odies owner was a man named lyman he was written in to give jon someone to talk with davis later realized that garfield and jon could communicate nonverbally the strip originally centered on jon was first rejected by the king features posthall and the chicago tribunenew york news agencies all of which asked davis to focus on the cat who in their opinion got the better lines united feature syndicate accepted the retooled strip in  and debuted it in  newspapers on june  of that year however after a test run the chicago suntimes dropped it only to reinstate it after readers complaints garfields first sunday page ran on june   being featured as a thirdpager until march   a halfpage debuted the following sunday march  with the strips for march  and   having a unique ninepanel format but ufs curtailed further use of it it did however allow davis to use the format for his us acres strip the appearance of the characters gradually changed over time the left panel is taken from the march   strip the right is from the july   strip the strip underwent stylistic changes evolving from the realistic style of the – strips to a more cartoonish look from  onward this change has mainly affected garfields design which underwent a darwinian evolution in which he began walking on his hind legs slimmed down and stopped looking  through squinty little eyescitation needed his evolution according to davis was to make it easier to push odie off the table or reach for a piece of pie jon also underwent physiological changes he now looks older than in the  strips  he is taller and he has larger features garfield quickly became a commercial success in  less than three years after its release the strip appeared in  newspapers and accumulated over  million in merchandise to manage the merchandise davis founded paws inc by  garfield became the worlds most syndicated strip appearing in  newspapers with  million readers worldwide by  garfield appeared in nearly  newspapers and sold

garfield involves removing garfields thought balloons from the strips some examples date from  a webcomic called arbuckle does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style the arbuckle website creator writes garfield changes from being a comic about a sassy corpulent feline and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely pathetic delusional man who talks to his pets consider that jon according to garfield canon cannot hear his cats thoughts this is the world as he sees it this is his story another variation along the same lines called realfield or realistic garfield is to redraw garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons still another approach to editing the strips involves removing garfield and other main characters from the originals completely leaving jon talking to himself while strips in this vein can be found online as early as  the  site garfield minus garfield by dan walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media reception was largely positive at its peak the site received as many as  hits per day fans connected with jons loneliness and desperation and found his crazy antics humorous jim davis himself called

many additional characters but the four main ones are described here garfieldedit first appearance june   im not overweight im undertall garfield at large his first book  garfield is an orange fuzzy tabby cat born in the kitchen of an italian restaurant later revealed in the television special garfield his  lives to be mama leonis italian restaurant who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and pizza gags in the strips commonly deal with garfields obesity in one strip jon jokes i wouldnt say garfield is fat but the last time he got on a ferris wheel the two guys on top starved to death and his disdain of any form of exertion or work he is known for saying breathing is exercise in addition to being portrayed as lazy and fat garfield is also pessimistic narcissistic sadistic cynical sarcastic sardonic negative and smug he enjoys destroying things mauling the mailman tormenting odie and kicking odie off the table he also makes snide comments usually about jons inability to get a date in one strip when jon bemoans the fact that no one will go out with him on new years eve garfield replies dont feel bad jon they wouldnt go out with you even if it werent new years though garfield can be very cynical he does have a soft side for his teddy bear pooky food and sleep and one christmas he says they say i have to get up early be nice to people skip breakfast i wish it would never end however in the feature film garfield gets real and its sequels garfield is better behaved friendlier towards jon and odie less selfcentered and more sympathetic it has been wondered by many readers if garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him sometimes it seems like jon can hear him however it is mentioned in more than one strip that jon cannot understand garfield however in the feature film garfield gets real and its sequels garfield and the other animals save for odie are able to talk to and be understood by jon and the other humans in the  april april fools day  strip garfield still with thought balloons can be understood by jon to break the fourth wall  june is celebrated within the strip as garfields birthday the appearance in  claimed it to be his first birthday although in the first appearance of the strip  june  he was portrayed as a fullygrown cat implying that the birthday is of the strip itself garfield learns about his past from his grandfather who makes many jokes about garfield jon arbuckleedit first appearance june   jon heres my sixthgrade report card my parents were so proud garfield reading the report card jon has not shoved any crayons up his nose this term garfield  jon jonathan q arbuckle is garfields owner usually depicted as an awkward clumsy geek who has trouble finding a date jon had a crush on liz garfields veterinarian and is now dating her jon disapproves of garfields dont care not interested attitude and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him sometimes stating an interesting fact or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt garfield into thought garfield tends to brush this off with a simple yet logical remark and despite the trouble garfield causes jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of garfields shortcomings a fact which garfield often takes advantage of in the december   strip jon states that he is thirty years old nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties although he has not aged physically his birthday is july  jon loves or occasionally hates garfield and all cats many gags focus on this his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills his poor taste in clothes garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that two hundred moths committed suicide in another the geek police ordered jon to throw out his tie and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with polka ninjas other strips portray him as lacking intelligence he is seen reading a popup book in one strip jon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities in one strip his father upon seeing indoor plumbing remarks wooha aint science something jon occasionally visits his parents brother and grandmother at their farm it was implied that jon is inspired by a drawing of davis himself when he was first drawing the strip jon was initially portrayed as a cartoonist in earlier strips as jim davis stated this wouldve been a way to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist himself but this eventually faded in the later strips odieedit first appearance august   jon i think im having some kind of identity crisis garfield walking past odie who is lying in a kitchen drawer he thinks hes having an identity crisisodie thinks hes a potato peeler garfield  odie is a yellow longeared beagle with a large slobbering tongue who walks on all four legs though occasionally he will walk on two like garfield he was originally owned by jons friend lyman though jon adopted him after lyman was written out of the strip the book garfield his  lives  retcons odies origin there is no mention of lyman and odie was a puppy when he was acquired by jon as company for garfield when garfield was a kitten odie is usually portrayed as naïve happy affectionate and blissfully unaware of garfields cynical sadistic nature despite the physical abuse garfield exhibits toward him including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself on some occasions however he is depicted more intelligently as one strip in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent garfield from doing this and actually hurts garfields foot in one strip when garfield and jon are out of the house odie is seen reading war and peace and watching a television program an evening with mozart odie has only talked once in another strip published on january   he is seen solving jons sudoku puzzle strips that play off of the size of odies tongue and his inscrutability include one in which garfield remarks is there any wonder why theres no room in his head for a brain and another in which garfield pulls odies tail which results in his tongue being pulled outvolume  issue needed dr liz wilsonedit first appearance june   jon tell me liz havent we met somewhere before a rice paddy in hong kong liz look jerk ill be the vet for your cat but i wont play fall guy for your stupid lines understood jon shocked uhhuh so long doctor liz have a nice day garfield  dr liz wilson is garfields veterinarian and a longtime crush of jon arbuckle she has a somewhat deadpan sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to jons outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion jon often attempted to ask her out on a date but rarely succeeded however in an extended story arc from june  to july   the main event on july  liz and jon kiss now they are a couple liz now frequently visits garfield and jons home often discouraging garfield from eating junk food at the same time garfield is about to do so but he does not listen recurring subjects and themesedit many of the gags focus on garfields obsessive eating and obesity his fear of spiders his hatred of mondays diets and any form of exertion his constant shedding which annoys jon and his abuse of odie and jon as well as his obsession with mailing nermal to abu dhabi or simply throwing through the front door though he will eat nearly anything with the exception of raisins and spinach garfield is particularly fond of lasagna he also enjoys eating jons houseplants and other pets mainly birds and fish he also has odd relationships with household pests garfield generally spares mice and even cooperates with them to cause mischief much to jons chagrin but will readily swat or pound spiders flat other gags focus on jons poor social skills and inability to get a date before he started dating liz he often tried to get dates usually without success in one strip after failing to get a date with nancy he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother he ended up getting shot down by three generations when he does get a date it usually goes awry jons dates have slashed his tires been tranquilized and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears the storylines featuring jons dates rarely appear now before he had dates with many odd characters whereas now he exclusively dates liz garfields world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips like the vets office a place he loathes irmas diner is another occasional setting irma is a chirpy but slowwitted and unattractive waitressmanager and one of jons few friends the terrible food is the center of most of the jokes along with the poor management jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm this results in weeklong comical displays of stupidity by jon and his family and their interactions there is a comic strip where jons brother doc boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and doc boy calls it entertainment on the farm jons mother will cook huge dinners garfield hugs her for this jon has a grandmother who in a strip kicked odie garfield subsequently hugged her jons parents have twice visited jon garfield and odie in the city jons father drove into town on his tractor which he doubleparked and brought a rooster to wake him up as garfield has a love for food they will often eat out at restaurants most trips end up embarrassing because garfield will pig out or jon will do something stupid including wearing an ugly shirt which happened one night when he took liz on a date when jon does take liz on a date garfield occasionally tags alongonce he ate the bread and other food at an italian restaurant they went to frequently the characters break the fourth wall mostly to explain something to the readers talk about a subject that often sets up the strips punchline like jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds garfield in the kitchen and chases him out or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed sometimes this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip for example in one strip garfield catches a cold and complains about it noting i can hardy eben understad by own thoughts short storylinesedit one particular semirecurring storyline features jon and liz on a date in a restaurant they sometimes are waited on by the italian armando who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards jon presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery on other occasions the couple receives a different waiter such as a large ogrelike man who intimidates jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food another commonly recurring character although hardly ever seen is jons neighbor mrs feeny garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her to the point the she even erects an electric fence which of course does not stop him other unique themes are things like garfields believe it or dont garfields law garfields history of dogs and garfields history of cats which show science history and the world from garfields point of view another particular theme is national fat week where garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people also there was a storyline involving garfield catching odie eating his food and kicking odie into next week soon garfield realizes that lunch isnt the same without odie he always slips up behind me barks loudly and makes me fall into my food garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself a few days after the storyline began garfield is lying in his bed with a nagging feeling im forgetting something with odie landing on garfield in the next panel jon and liz began to go out more frequently jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after garfield and odie though they do not always work out two particular examples are lillian an eccentric and very nearsighted old lady with odd quirks and greta a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during new years eve most of december is spent preparing for christmas with a predictable focus on presents other christmas themed strips include jons attempts at decorating the tree and house or the attempt to buy the tree some years the christmas strips started as early as the end of november another example is splut week when garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him for most of garfields history being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia splut hence the name every week before june  the strip focuses on garfields birthday which he dreads because of his fear of getting older this started happening after his sixth birthday however before his th birthday liz put garfield on a diet on june   garfield was given the greatest birthday present im off my diet occasionally the strip celebrates halloween as well with scarythemed jokes such as mask gags there are also seasonal jokes with snowrelated gags common in january or february and beach or heat themed jokes in the summer right panel of october   strip one storyline which ran the week before halloween in  oct  to oct  is unique among garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous it depicts garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists in garfields twentieth anniversary collection in which the strips are reprinted jim davis discusses the genesis for this series during a writing session for halloween i got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips i wanted to scare people and what do people fear most why being alone we carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers reaction ranged from right on to this isnt a trend is it one of the recurring storylines involves garfield getting lost or running away the longest one of these lasted for over a month in  august  to september  it began with jon telling garfield to go get the newspaper garfield walks outside to get it but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off – and decides to find out jon notices garfield has been gone too long so he sends odie out to find him he quickly realizes his mistake odie being not too bright also gets lost jon starts to get lonely so he offers a reward for the return of garfield and odie he is not descriptive so animals including an elephant monkeys a seal a snake a kangaroo and joey and turtles are brought to jons house for the reward after a series of events including odie being adopted by a small girl both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined and both going to a pet shop garfield and odie make it back home another story involved jon going away on a business trip around christmas time leaving garfield a weeks worth of food which he devoured instantly garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out he then reunites with his mother and eventually makes it back home in the snow on christmas eve  december  to  part of this storyline was taken from the  emmywinning special garfield on the town paws incedit paws inc was founded in  by jim davis to support the

veterans day controversyedit the controversial comic strip davis attracted criticism from the mainstream media for a garfield strip in which the last panel appeared to be a negative reference to veterans day that appeared in newspapers on november   in the strip a spider who is about to be squashed by garfield boasts that if he is squished he will get a holiday in his remembrance the next panel shows a classroom of spiders in which a teacher asks the students why spiders celebrate national stupid day implying that the spider was squished davis quickly apologized for the poorly timed comic strip saying that it had been written a year in advance and that both his brother and son were veterans bibliographyedit primary sourcesedit davis jim   years  still kicking garfields twentieth

publishing genres humor garfield is an american comic strip created by jim davis published since  it chronicles the life of the title character the cat garfield jon his owner and jons dog odie as of  it was syndicated in roughly  newspapers and journals and held the guinness world record for being the worlds most widely syndicated comic strip though this is rarely mentioned in print garfield is set in muncie indiana the home of jim davis according to the television special happy birthday garfield common themes in the strip include garfields laziness obsessive eating coffee and disdain of mondays and diets the strips focus is mostly on the interactions among garfield jon and odie but other recurring minor characters appear as well originally created with the intentions to come up with a good marketable character garfield has spawned merchandise earning  million to  billion annually in addition to the various merchandise and commercial tieins the strip has spawned several animated television specials two animated television series two theatrical featurelength liveactioncgi animated films and three fully cgi animated directtovideo movies part of the strips broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of social or political commentary though this was daviss original intention he also admitted that his grasp of politics isnt strong joking that for many years he thought opec

comic strip called gnorm gnat which met with little success one editor said his art was good his gags were great but that nobody can identify with bugs davis decided to take a long hard look at the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well but there were no cats at the time davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with  cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat he then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created garfield who borrows the first letter of his name from daviss earlier work garfield originally consisted of four main characters garfield the titular character was based on the cats davis was around growing up he took his name and personality from daviss grandfather james a garfield davis who was in daviss words a large cantankerous man jon arbuckle came from a s coffee commercial and odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by davis which featured odie the village idiot early on in the strip odies owner was a man named lyman he was written in to give jon someone to talk with davis later realized that garfield and jon could communicate nonverbally the strip originally centered on jon was first rejected by the king features posthall and the chicago tribunenew york news agencies all of which asked davis to focus on the cat who in their opinion got the better lines united feature syndicate accepted the retooled strip in  and debuted it in  newspapers on june  of that year however after a test run the chicago suntimes dropped it only to reinstate it after readers complaints garfields first sunday page ran on june   being featured as a thirdpager until march   a halfpage debuted the following sunday march  with the strips for march  and   having a unique ninepanel format but ufs curtailed further use of it it did however allow davis to use the format for his us acres strip the appearance of the characters gradually changed over time the left panel is taken from the march   strip the right is from the july   strip the strip underwent stylistic changes evolving from the realistic style of the – strips to a more cartoonish look from  onward this change has mainly affected garfields design which underwent a darwinian evolution in which he began walking on his hind legs slimmed down and stopped looking  through squinty little eyescitation needed his evolution according to davis was to make it easier to push odie off the table or reach for a piece of pie jon also underwent physiological changes he now looks older than in the  strips  he is taller and he has larger features garfield quickly became a commercial success in  less than three years after its release the strip appeared in  newspapers and accumulated over  million in merchandise to manage the merchandise davis founded paws inc by  garfield became the worlds most syndicated strip appearing in  newspapers with  million readers worldwide by  garfield appeared in nearly  newspapers and sold

garfield involves removing garfields thought balloons from the strips some examples date from  a webcomic called arbuckle does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style the arbuckle website creator writes garfield changes from being a comic about a sassy corpulent feline and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely pathetic delusional man who talks to his pets consider that jon according to garfield canon cannot hear his cats thoughts this is the world as he sees it this is his story another variation along the same lines called realfield or realistic garfield is to redraw garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons still another approach to editing the strips involves removing garfield and other main characters from the originals completely leaving jon talking to himself while strips in this vein can be found online as early as  the  site garfield minus garfield by dan walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media reception was largely positive at its peak the site received as many as  hits per day fans connected with jons loneliness and desperation and found his crazy antics humorous jim davis himself called

makes snide comments usually about jons inability to get a date in one strip when jon bemoans the fact that no one will go out with him on new years eve garfield replies dont feel bad jon they wouldnt go out with you even if it werent new years though garfield can be very cynical he does have a soft side for his teddy bear pooky food and sleep and one christmas he says they say i have to get up early be nice to people skip breakfast i wish it would never end however in the feature film garfield gets real and its sequels garfield is better behaved friendlier towards jon and odie less selfcentered and more sympathetic it has been wondered by many readers if garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him sometimes it seems like jon can hear him however it is mentioned in more than one strip that jon cannot understand garfield however in the feature film garfield gets real and its sequels garfield and the other animals save for odie are able to talk to and be understood by jon and the other humans in the  april april fools day  strip garfield still with thought balloons can be understood by jon to break the fourth wall  june is celebrated within the strip as garfields birthday the appearance in  claimed it to be his first birthday although in the first appearance of the strip  june  he was portrayed as a fullygrown cat implying that the birthday is of the strip itself garfield learns about his past from his grandfather who makes many jokes about garfield jon arbuckleedit first appearance june   jon heres my sixthgrade report card my parents were so proud garfield reading the report card jon has not shoved any crayons up his nose this term garfield  jon jonathan q arbuckle is garfields owner usually depicted as an awkward clumsy geek who has trouble finding a date jon had a crush on liz garfields veterinarian and is now dating her jon disapproves of garfields dont care not interested attitude and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him sometimes stating an interesting fact or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt garfield into thought garfield tends to brush this off with a simple yet logical remark and despite the trouble garfield causes jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of garfields shortcomings a fact which garfield often takes advantage of in the december   strip jon states that he is thirty years old nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties although he has not aged physically his birthday is july  jon loves or occasionally hates garfield and all cats many gags focus on this his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills his poor taste in clothes garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that two hundred moths committed suicide in another the geek police ordered jon to throw out his tie and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with polka ninjas other strips portray him as lacking intelligence he is seen reading a popup book in one strip jon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities in one strip his father upon seeing indoor plumbing remarks wooha aint science something jon occasionally visits his parents brother and grandmother at their farm it was implied that jon is inspired by a drawing of davis himself when he was first drawing the strip jon was initially portrayed as a cartoonist in earlier strips as jim davis stated this wouldve been a way to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist himself but this eventually faded in the later strips odieedit first appearance august   jon i think im having some kind of identity crisis garfield walking past odie who is lying in a kitchen drawer he thinks hes having an identity crisisodie thinks hes a potato peeler garfield  odie is a yellow longeared beagle with a large slobbering tongue who walks on all four legs though occasionally he will walk on two like garfield he was originally owned by jons friend lyman though jon adopted him after lyman was written out of the strip the book garfield his  lives  retcons odies origin there is no mention of lyman and odie was a puppy when he was acquired by jon as company for garfield when garfield was a kitten odie is usually portrayed as naïve happy affectionate and blissfully unaware of garfields cynical sadistic nature despite the physical abuse garfield exhibits toward him including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself on some occasions however he is depicted more intelligently as one strip in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent garfield from doing this and actually hurts garfields foot in one strip when garfield and jon are out of the house odie is seen reading war and peace and watching a television program an evening with mozart odie has only talked once in another strip published on january   he is seen solving jons sudoku puzzle strips that play off of the size of odies tongue and his inscrutability include one in which garfield remarks is there any wonder why theres no room in his head for a brain and another in which garfield pulls odies tail which results in his tongue being pulled outvolume  issue needed dr liz wilsonedit first appearance june   jon tell me liz havent we met somewhere before a rice paddy in hong kong liz look jerk ill be the vet for your cat but i wont play fall guy for your stupid lines understood jon shocked uhhuh so long doctor liz have a nice day garfield  dr liz wilson is garfields veterinarian and a longtime crush of jon arbuckle she has a somewhat deadpan sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to jons outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion jon often attempted to ask her out on a date but rarely succeeded however in an extended story arc from june  to july   the main event on july  liz and jon kiss now they are a couple liz now frequently visits garfield and jons home often discouraging garfield from eating junk food at the same time garfield is about to do so but he does not listen recurring subjects and themesedit many of the gags focus on garfields obsessive eating and obesity his fear of spiders his hatred of mondays diets and any form of exertion his constant shedding which annoys jon and his abuse of odie and jon as well as his obsession with mailing nermal to abu dhabi or simply throwing through the front door though he will eat nearly anything with the exception of raisins and spinach garfield is particularly fond of lasagna he also enjoys eating jons houseplants and other pets mainly birds and fish he also has odd relationships with household pests garfield generally spares mice and even cooperates with them to cause mischief much to jons chagrin but will readily swat or pound spiders flat other gags focus on jons poor social skills and inability to get a date before he started dating liz he often tried to get dates usually without success in one strip after failing to get a date with nancy he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother he ended up getting shot down by three generations when he does get a date it usually goes awry jons dates have slashed his tires been tranquilized and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears the storylines featuring jons dates rarely appear now before he had dates with many odd characters whereas now he exclusively dates liz garfields world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips like the vets office a place he loathes irmas diner is another occasional setting irma is a chirpy but slowwitted and unattractive waitressmanager and one of jons few friends the terrible food is the center of most of the jokes along with the poor management jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm this results in weeklong comical displays of stupidity by jon and his family and their interactions there is a comic strip where jons brother doc boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and doc boy calls it entertainment on the farm jons mother will cook huge dinners garfield hugs her for this jon has a grandmother who in a strip kicked odie garfield subsequently hugged her jons parents have twice visited jon garfield and odie in the city jons father drove into town on his tractor which he doubleparked and brought a rooster to wake him up as garfield has a love for food they will often eat out at restaurants most trips end up embarrassing because garfield will pig out or jon will do something stupid including wearing an ugly shirt which happened one night when he took liz on a date when jon does take liz on a date garfield occasionally tags alongonce he ate the bread and other food at an italian restaurant they went to frequently the characters break the fourth wall mostly to explain something to the readers talk about a subject that often sets up the strips punchline like jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds garfield in the kitchen and chases him out or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed sometimes this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip for example in one strip garfield catches a cold and complains about it noting i can hardy eben understad by own thoughts short storylinesedit one particular semirecurring storyline features jon and liz on a date in a restaurant they sometimes are waited on by the italian armando who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards jon presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery on other occasions the couple receives a different waiter such as a large ogrelike man who intimidates jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food another commonly recurring character although hardly ever seen is jons neighbor mrs feeny garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her to the point the she even erects an electric fence which of course does not stop him other unique themes are things like garfields believe it or dont garfields law garfields history of dogs and garfields history of cats which show science history and the world from garfields point of view another particular theme is national fat week where garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people also there was a storyline involving garfield catching odie eating his food and kicking odie into next week soon garfield realizes that lunch isnt the same without odie he always slips up behind me barks loudly and makes me fall into my food garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself a few days after the storyline began garfield is lying in his bed with a nagging feeling im forgetting something with odie landing on garfield in the next panel jon and liz began to go out more frequently jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after garfield and odie though they do not always work out two particular examples are lillian an eccentric and very nearsighted old lady with odd quirks and greta a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during new years eve most of december is spent preparing for christmas with a predictable focus on presents other christmas themed strips include jons attempts at decorating the tree and house or the attempt to buy the tree some years the christmas strips started as early as the end of november another example is splut week when garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him for most of garfields history being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia splut hence the name every week before june  the strip focuses on garfields birthday which he dreads because of his fear of getting older this started happening after his sixth birthday however before his th birthday liz put garfield on a diet on june   garfield was given the greatest birthday present im off my diet occasionally the strip celebrates halloween as well with scarythemed jokes such as mask gags there are also seasonal jokes with snowrelated gags common in january or february and beach or heat themed jokes in the summer right panel of october   strip one storyline which ran the week before halloween in  oct  to oct  is unique among garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous it depicts garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists in garfields twentieth anniversary collection in which the strips are reprinted jim davis discusses the genesis for this series during a writing session for halloween i got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips i wanted to scare people and what do people fear most why being alone we carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers reaction ranged from right on to this isnt a trend is it one of the recurring storylines involves garfield getting lost or running away the longest one of these lasted for over a month in  august  to september  it began with jon telling garfield to go get the newspaper garfield walks outside to get it but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off – and decides to find out jon notices garfield has been gone too long so he sends odie out to find him he quickly realizes his mistake odie being not too bright also gets lost jon starts to get lonely so he offers a reward for the return of garfield and odie he is not descriptive so animals including an elephant monkeys a seal a snake a kangaroo and joey and turtles are brought to jons house for the reward after a series of events including odie being adopted by a small girl both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined and both going to a pet shop garfield and odie make it back home another story involved jon going away on a business trip around christmas time leaving garfield a weeks worth of food which he devoured instantly garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out he then reunites with his mother and eventually makes it back home in the snow on christmas eve  december  to  part of this storyline was taken from the  emmywinning special garfield on the town paws incedit paws inc was founded in  by jim davis to support the

veterans day controversyedit the controversial comic strip davis attracted criticism from the mainstream media for a garfield strip in which the last panel appeared to be a negative reference to veterans day that appeared in newspapers on november   in the strip a spider who is about to be squashed by garfield boasts that if he is squished he will get a holiday in his remembrance the next panel shows a classroom of spiders in which a teacher asks the students why spiders celebrate national stupid day implying that the spider was squished davis quickly apologized for the poorly timed comic strip saying that it had been written a year in advance and that both his brother and son were veterans bibliographyedit primary sourcesedit davis jim   years  still kicking garfields twentieth

fierce and caring advocates recommendation by yun family i am writing this recommendation on behalf of the garfield law group i serve as the pastor of international calvary church i came to know of their office because a former member of our congregation was experiencing critical immigration problems and was in danger of being deported this individual had played an important role in our congregation for many years mr garfield and his associate jane park personally came to my church to meet with me to obtain letters of support from me and other members of our congregation they kept me apprised of developments on the case and they informed me that their efforts were successful i was also aware that mr garfield and two of his korean associates met the president of the korean american association in person to advocate for his client i was very impressed by their dedication and work product i was also impressed by their character mr garfield waived much of the legal fee for his services when it became clear that his client was unable to pay his entire family was saved by that office recommendation by pastorbosik moses jang all testimonials contact us today  presuitability

entitled “mechanisms for outofstate ownership in colorado” january   marked a monumental change for cannabis business ownership requirements now any us citizen may apply to take an ownership interest in a cannabis business subject to a criminal background check and other ownership qualifications however until recently the state had not promulgated any rules or policies to facilitate out of state ownership of a colorado cannabis business   over the last few weeks the colorado marijuana enforcement division the “med” has provided guidance to prospective out of state cannabis business owners for any prospective business owner with less than one year of colorado residency the med requires a “presuitability” review the presuitability review is necessary for new business license applicants as well as applicants seeking to add their names to an existing business ie change of ownership applicants prior to submitting a new business application or a change of ownership application to the med all prospective owners must either be a colorado resident for at least one year or go through the presuitability review the med has refused to schedule appointments for new businesses or changes of ownership until each prospective owner has completed the presuitability review the med has not provided any information on how long the presuitability review will take but we expect a  day review process   the presuitability application closely resembles the associated key application which has long been a requirement for cannabis business owners the application requires   a completed application disposition records for any criminal charge or arrest in the last  years for change of ownership – a purchase agreement showing the applicant’s interest in the cannabis business a color copy of the applicant’s driver’s license a fee of  for each presuitability applicant fingerprint cards and a fingerprint verification form which is included in the application   presuitability is a revolving process the application review rollout has been anything but smooth we have a direct line of communication with the med and will update with any changes for now it’s worth a look at your business’s current ownership and lending structures to see if a presuitability application fits your business plan we have successfully guided clients through the presuitability review and can help
