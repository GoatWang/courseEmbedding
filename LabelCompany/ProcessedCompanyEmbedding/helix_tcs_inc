needle logohorizontal shoppingcart info icon navigation close our story the truth press philanthropy our team mattress stores are greedy learn the truth now a mattress shouldn’t cost a fortune overpriced overcomplicated mattresses have been the standard until now unfair markups typically mattresses are marked up  times by the time they’re sold that means you’re mostly paying for gimmicks unfair retail markups sales commissions and wholesaler’s profits markup true cost tuft  needle big mattress often gimmicky marketing unfair retail markups sales commissions and overwhelming options most mattress companies use the same four ingredients but not us big mattress thinks “innovating” means “rearranging outdated materials to charge you more money” it’s all these same  old layers mixed and matched under different names so you cant compare and cross shop  latex the problem with latex is pressure relief because the more you push on it the more it pushes back this causes painful pressure points latex is an outdated material that mattress companies just never stopped using  memory foam memory foam has no bounce its like sleeping in quicksand and once you’re stuck you start getting hot  springs why is coiled steel considered comfortable spring mattresses are mostly empty space so you get mostly empty support  egg crate foam socalled “egg crate” layers are a single block of foam cut in half then disguised as a bonus feature it’s an easy way for mattress companies to charge you more while selling you less tn adaptive® foam innovation by us perfected by you the mattress industry hadn’t changed in years aside from adding new sales tricks and gimmicks so when we started tuft  needle we worked to innovate something entirely new for the industry unparalleled in comfort and support our proprietary foam was painstakingly perfected through customer feedback it’s not memory foam it’s not latex it’s tn adaptive® foam and because it adapts to every individual’s body you’ll always sleep on the ideal firmness for you tn adaptive® foam our key innovation is tn adaptive® foam it offers a gradient of support so the more pressure you apply the more it adapts to support you zillion layer mattresses are a scam more layers means hot sleeping tuft  needle we’ve worked hard to reduce our layers down to the essential two the performance of your sleep surface is what matters most because it provides the comfort you feel and the interaction your body needs our innovative foam is what makes this all possible other guys every mattress layer adds a layer of glue and every layer of glue reduces airflow reduced airflow means hot sleeping and paying for extra layers you won’t feel cutting costs direct to you we run our supply chain vertically and manufacture our

— a mattress their unfortunate mattress shopping experience and purchase of a  overpriced and uncomfortable mattress led to restless nights and buyer’s remorse for jt after sharing his painful story with his good friend daehee park they commiserated on the severity of the problem they realized most mattress companies were marking up prices by almost x “it became emotional at that point” daehee says “we felt robbed” cofounders jt and daehee launched tuft  needle in  to change the way mattresses were designed and sold they pioneered the single model universally comfortable mattress jt explains “our mattress is made with foam engineered by us conveniently compressed into a small box and delivered free of charge to our customer’s door” with no investors marino and park started with  they have bootstrapped the company and relentlessly focused on making the business as efficient as possible cutting out the waste and passing on the savings to customers we left memory foam in the past forget about latex and springs too tn adaptive® foam engineered by us is the first of its kind the result of a partnership with the world’s leading foam scientists our unique formula was tested refined and perfected at the molecular level tn adaptive® foam allows us to deliver both comfort and support in a single material whereas other brands are forced to mix and match layers using traditional materials like memory foam and latex these are then labeled “premium” a marketing trick used to hide the drawbacks of stacked layers fact individual mattress layers compete with each other when stacked as a result the specific benefits of each layer are often canceled we’ve proven performance on the sleep surface is what matters most with tn adaptive® foam atop our base layer you’ll secure all the benefits of the “other guys”  layers in just   the fewest layers of any competitor and as a result the most efficiently manufactured we pass the savings onto you   affordable and highquality with nothing to hide soft without the sink perfect for side back  stomach sleepers the tuft  needle mattress is soft and comfy while still being bouncy and supportive after thousands of reviews emails and phone calls from our customers we’ve made over  iterations to our mattress the result is far greater than any focus group could ever produce real feedback in realtime has helped us perfect our product tn adaptive tm foam we’ve engineered a new foam based purely on customer feedback it captures the best benefits of memory foam and latex while leaving their negative attributes behind supportive base layer our custom tn adaptive® foam is paired with a high quality support layer that forms the perfect foundation for our mattress ideal support our foam is ideal for sleepers of any size or weight – and this is what makes it unique the more pressure you put on it the more it reacts to support you no tricky tactics disguised as features junk science doesn’t keep you cool common sense does our mattress is designed to draw heat out in four simple ways  heat wicking heat is drawn into the mattress where gel and graphite work together to disperse heat outward and away from your body  breathable with the help of our fabric air flows through the foam cells to boost the speed of heat transfer through the mattress  no more quicksand our support layer helps hold you closer to the surface to avoid the oven effect caused by sinking in too deeply  fewer layers other brands use lotsolayers of random foams containing different cell structures together our  layers create uniform breathability you should only pay for what matters fancy wordplay gets tiring because it “sounds” expensive doesn’t mean it should be with tuft  needle price is not a reflection of quality consumers are trained to think that high priced goods are always better but a quality mattress can be honestly and fairly priced so we designed an incredible mattress then focused on reasonable pricing by increasing efficiency and cutting out the needless costs that normally are passed on to consumers the truth is we’re cutting costs not corners we run our own supply chain and sell direct to you our two layers are all you need the other guys add layers to make it more expensive while stripping away benefits tuft  needle  layers everybody else    layers every layer of foam or material needs a layer of glue and every layer of glue reduces airflow reduced airflow means hot sleeping and paying for fancy material  layers deep that has no impact on your sleep we’ve worked hard to reduce our layers down to the essential two the performance of your sleep surface is what matters most because it provides the comfort you feel and the interaction your body needs our innovative foam is what makes this all possible greenguard certified oekotex certified certipurus certified fire retardant cover no pbde low voc at tuft  needle our foams are certipur certified our

here us law requires that every mattress sold needs to pass two very specific burn tests an open flame test and a cigarette test in order to pass these two tests a mattress typically needs to have a component known as a fire barrier that self extinguishes the mattress when on fire weve done a lot of research as a team and decided the best solution for our tn mattress was a fire sock flame barrier this component is permanently installed around the foam core of our mattress which is then fully encased within the outer cover you will not come into contact with the sock unless you unzip and remove the outer cover of your mattress which we do not recommend if you believe it is necessary to remove the cover for example to clean it more thoroughly in the case of serious spills or soiling we recommend that you contact us before doing so we may be able to offer tips to avoid potential issues with removing and replacing the cover in any event our mattress cover should never be machine washed our fire barrier doesnt contain any fire retardant chemicals instead its a tubular knitted fabric often referred to as a fire sock composed of four inert fibers and is inherently flame retardant our fire barrier has been tested and certified by oekotex® oekotex® tests for harmful substances in textiles and materials the more intensive the skin contact of a product and the more
