pages   whiting  adams co   the art of making brushes was part of the title of us patent no  awarded to john l whiting of boston massachusetts on september   which related to certain improvements regarding flat brushes such as whitewash paste and wall brushes since the three germanborn wessling brothers some of their children a cousin or two as well as some of their inlaws worked as brushmakers for the whitings it is very likely that such an item had been crafted by them in  artemus woodward founded a business in medfield massachusetts to make his own brushes and it was reported to have been a business new to this section of the country at the time that his enterprise was begun brushes were usually imported from england and were quite expensive although such items were lacking in quality as a remedy some skilled workers from germantown pennsylvania were hired and worked under the supervision of woodward seth whiting and john wickliffe adams would acquire their brush making skills from these men woodwards business however lasted only a few years john wickliffe adams was possessed of remarkable mechanical skills as well as a good education he established in  at his homestead a brush manufacturing business and for a long time he conducted a thriving business selling the output to merchants in boston because of the war of  had caused the importation of brushes to be curtailed his business prospered from its inception at about this same time seth whiting joined adams but their partnership existed only for a few years and upon its dissolution probably circa  whiting went to phillipston massachusetts adams son john jay adams was born in  and after having learned the brush making trade from his father went to taunton massachusetts in the early s to set up his own brush business he would soon to relocate to boston he was listed in the  boston city directory where he developed and improved the brush making process until his production stood in the front rank his first patent for a brush was issued in  during the few years in boston adams business was conducted at several different locations in the s he was working at  washington there he remained until february of  when he purchased from edward g parker the land and building with his partners charles vaughn of cambridge massachusetts and william e abbot of dorchester massachusetts the purchase price was  and a mortgage was given to the seller for  see  et seq the new business address remained  washington until a few years later when the building was expanded and then its address became  and  washington  in  adams business continued to trade under the same name but the principles were charles vaughn and william m vaughn of cambridge as there was no mention of adams being then in boston it would seem that the partnership was reshaped in  adams and his new partners entered into an agreement with their abutters what is interesting is that adams gave new york city as his address while the  other partners were from the boston area on july   adams sold his  interest in the business to his partners for  see  in new york city john jay adams carried on a very extensive business for many years in reviewing the directories for new york city covering the decade of the s adams was listed as residing on e th st and as having operated a brush business at  beekman in which area of the city there were a number of other brush manufacturers and suppliers of bristles however a change affecting his firm occurred around  as his residence remained the same but no mention was made as to his occupation or business at the same time a charles w mulford was in the brush trade at  beekman and mulfords residence was on long island in the  new york city directory located at  beekman was charles w mulford  co john jay adams died in  at new york city the directory for the year ending may   showed an advertisement placed by mulford in which he stated that he was the successor to jj adams  co and the sole manufacturers of adams brushes and that business had  beekman as its address the federal census of  for new york shows that charles w mulford lived in hempstead and was a brush manufacturer in the same household was a harvey w hascy age  and no occupation was providedx the directory for  continued to place mulfords business at  beekman and his residence was in hempstead li also harvey wickes hascy was associated with that business and he too resided in hempstead in the  directory hascy was a manager for a firm doing business at  beekman the  directory for hempstead showed that both mulford and hascy resided on the same street sometime in  or  mulfords business was located at  beekman and sometime around  mulford was no longer an owner of the company in the new york city directory for the year ending may   it was hascy who appeared to have been the owner and as its manager was alexander brawner circa  jj adams  co moved its operations to brooklyn new york the brooklyn city directory for the year ending may   listed the following as being connected with jj adams  co     hascy who resided in hempstead    brawner who resided in manhattan and    james h devereux of aspen colorado a james h devereux was shown in the new york city directory with the occupation of that as a mining engineer all three of these men would later become directors in the new corporation formed by the  merger of john l whiting  son co and jj adams co it had been previously mentioned that seth whiting and john w adams were contemporaries and had been coworkers in the brush making business whiting married mary kendall on november   in royalston massachusetts and their children were as follows year      name        place of birth    henrysusan hardingjohn lakelucius henrymary kendall jonas milesanistis aolive m phillipston massphillipston massshrewsbury mass royalston massroyalston massnew hampshirerindge nh he and his family lived at various times in massachusetts phillipston and shrewsbury and in new hampshire rindge until the early s they would then return to massachusetts where he had begun a brush making business in the fayville village of southborough seth whiting died there on april   at the age of  his death certificate stated that his occupation was that of a brushmaker the federal census of  for massachusetts showed that for the town of southborough that the only whitings were lucius h age  and john l age  who were both brushmakers the other family members were residing in nearby worcester the head of that household was mary k age  and her children jonas m age  anistis a age  and olive m age  seth whiting was born in shrewsbury and his parents were john l and olive from about  and onward mary k whiting and at least  of her children were living in boston john lake whiting married mary betsey sawin in  november or december in southborough massachusetts he was a brushmaker from boston age  at the time of their marriage she was  and residing in southborough she had been born in natick massachusetts  the children of john l and mary b s whiting were all born at  hersey place in boston massachusetts name birth    marriage         death     charles h william sawin mary angeline anna maria susie anistis    boston boston  boston  southborough mass brookline mass newton mass newton mass andover nh in the early s john l whiting was making brushes in boston and most likely working for one of the several brush manufacturing firms he was first mentioned in the boston city directory of  as a brushmaker in the decade of the s there were only  or  such businesses and they were all apt to have been small partnerships employing a small workforce many of these owners had apprenticed with the adams or with seth whiting before setting out on their own it was not possible to determine if john l whiting had been employed by any particular business but in the city directories he was referred to a brushmaker rather than as a brush manufacturer which was others had been described from the biography of lew c hill nc john l whiting had been associated with john jay adams in a brush factory at boston but he withdrew form that enterprise and founded his own business in  was this a consequence of adams sale of his interest in the partnership to the vaughns although the city directories listed whiting as being in boston from as early as  at some point whiting must have been working in portland maine since the documentation for the patent awarded to him on august   showed that city as his address whiting had in fact been in portland at the shop of darius white and left circa august of  in order to return boston according a history of the whiting company a history of whitings company described its development as  the business started in a small room on a small side street and outgrew its quarters several times by taking additional rooms and three times by changing localitymm whiting was a member of a partnership according to the boston city directory of  operating under the name of drinkwater homer j  whiting john l and it was located at  doane in the following year it had relocated to  blackstone in the  directory there was no longer any further mention of drinkwater but the business address reamined  blackstone until  when his business was shown as being at  and  oliver the business of john l whiting was something of a family concern because a brother jonas miles whiting was employed as brushmaker from the outset and another brother lucius henry whiting was hired as an agentsalesman in  lew c hill was working as bookkeeper his wifes uncle was john l whiting  mary kendall whiting had married charles d marcyxx beginning about  william sawin whiting was working for his father as a clerk the business possibly experienced an expansion in  as its address was given as    oliver it seemed that businesssales offices were at  oliver and the factory was at  oliver in  william s whiting joined his father in the capacity of partner and the business became known as john l whiting  son a major expansion took place in  when a parcel of land containing a little more than  sq ft was acquired by both john l whiting and william s whiting this lot was bounded by belcher lane washington place and high and purchase streets in the city directory the firms address was given as being at the corner of high and purchase the acquisition must not have been a simple matter as it involved the following series of transactions on may   a parcel of land containing  sq ft was purchased from the heirs of nathaniel brewer see  on june   a parcel of land containing  sq ft was purchased from joseph b glover see  on june   a parcel of land was purchased from william childs see  on may   a parcel of land was purchased from several members of the loomis family for  see  on may   a parcel of land was purchased from the estate of jerome kidder for  see  on june   a triangular shaped parcel of land was purchased from the city of boston for  see  in each of the above transactions there was never any mention of there having been structures built on any of the parcels perhaps any buildings had been destroyed by the great fire of boston it would seem that a new building was constructed as in january of  the whitings had borrowed  from the cambridge savings bank using land with a brick building thereon in boston including engines boilers and other machinery or fixtures forming part of realty the term of the loan was  years and the annual rate of interest was  see  for a surveyors depiction of the lots dimensions the present factory at the corner of high and purchase streets being the most complete and largest factory brush under one roof known occupying an entire block with streets on four sides with six stories and basement for height  another comment made in a publication from  was that it  is now one of the leading firms in this line brush making in the united states having an extensive factory near rowe wharfpih for a number of illustrations of the interior of the factory please see this page some of the boston city atlases referred to this property as the whiting building whose address was  high street the new factory enabled the whitings to more than double their production capacity and the number of workers increased accordingly the  boston city directory listed henry wessling as being employed as a foreman at a business located at high street and hermann wessling was employed at the same address as a brushmaker in the  directory henrys occupation was that of a brushmaker without any business address being provided that same edition marked the first time that henry had been listed in the boston city directories in a speech given by john l whiting in  he discussed brush making and how the industry had changed since the time when he had begun as an apprentice to his father in part he said it takes several men nowadays to make a practical brushmaker and it is true the trade is vastly more complicated now than formerly but  or  years ago apprentices learned trades thoroughly in fact i think we have only  thorough oldfashioned brushmakers in our employ his attitudes on well trained workmen were also expressed in a pamphlet on brush making by stating that it  very much depends on the quality and proportion of stock that go into any given batch and the skill and judgment to so prepare the stock can only be realized by the brushmaker in his speech whiting went on to say that his business had about  machines and many specialized tools in the factory for brush making for an account of how brushes were made at whitings factory see appendix i in  lew c hill was made a member of john l whiting  son however it was not possible to determine what percentage of the business he had acquired john l whiting died on june   in boston and at the time of his death his brush manufacturing business was reported to have been the largest in the united states it was said that his business consumed  of all the bristles imported by america as well as a large percentage of the supply of domestic bristles his wife inherited his estate which was valued at about  john l whiting had been a holder of many patents his inventionsimprovements included brush designs as well as the machinery used in the brush making process  a device for making ferrules a boring tool for brush handles and a machine for sorting and arranging bristles the latter device which had been patented in  may have been acquired through enoch b whiting of st albans vermont the royalties from the licensing of these items were a significant source of revenue for the company by introducing new methods in the marketing and manufacturing of brushes his business became an important factor in the trade in essence he brought an artisan enterprise heavily dependent on hand work into the industrial age see appendix i for a description of early brush making processes the formula for whitings successful brand of products was to manufacture high quality brushes which were priced competitively in order to increase market share the elements of his business plan included obtaining patents and trademarks lobbying for protective tariff legislation increased duties on imported brushes and reduced duties for imported bristles introducing labor saving devices and production methods purchasing raw materials in large quantities to reduce unit costs and training and retaining a skilled workforce attesting to the quality of those products whiting received many awards including a gold medal at the columbian exhibition in chicago from his participation in industrial expositions throughout the world william s whiting succeeded his father as president of the company he married mary c allen in  and they were the parents of the following children      name     year place of birth allen sawinnatalieelizabeth st john  bostonbostonbrookline mass a change in the ownership of the property at the corner on high and purchase streets took place on july   when william s whiting conveyed his interest in same to his mother mary b whiting on the same date lew c hill did likewise see  and  hill was the companys treasurer at that time from the records of the massachusetts department of corporations and taxation on july   the john l whiting  son company was incorporated with an authorized capital of  and the corporation issued  shares each having a par value of  william s whiting was the president and treasurer lew c hill and anna m whiting were the other incorporators it would seem that as a result of the death of her husband the partnership was dissolved by mrs whitings acquiring of the interests of her son and of hill the consideration for the acquisition of those interests was more than likely shares in the newly formed corporation it is assumed that anna m whiting acted as the representative of the familys interests beginning around  and ending in  boston was the most important brush making city in the world however some significant events transpired in the early s when the pittsburgh plate glass co acquired several companies  patton paint co in  and rennous kleine  co a baltimore based brush manufacturer ppgs strategy was based on expanding its distribution network as a glass manufacturer its products were sold through hardware stores at the retail level since their sales representatives already called at such places by offering a wider array of products more sales would follow thus paints and brushes were added as product lines at the same time these actions also made others aware that competition would become more intense another factor to consider was that a change in technology was about to occur in that around  thomas devilbiss was experimenting with a spray gun as mass production in the manufacturing process was beginning to evolve at this time the adoption of a spray gun was a major advance in the application of paint and lacquer to those items have having wide uniformly flat surfaces by the s this technology was a regular feature on the assembly lines of furniture and automobile manufacturers for example in  henry wessling borrowed some money from whitings widow to purchase some land in roxbury which he would subdivide on one of the lots his brother hermann had a house built where he and his family would live for many years see  also henry wessling borrowed some money from mrs whiting in order to buy the real estate on hawthorn street see  and  although it is not known exactly when henry wessling began working for whiting the sketch of him might provide a clue the date of  might coincide with his th year at the company he arrived in america on december of  and he was listed in the ships passenger manifest as a brushmaker one of henry wesslings obituaries in  referred to him as a general foreman or as a superintendant the whitings operations continued to flourish and it expanded again on october   when it acquired a parcel of land in bostons south end containing  sq ft including a brick building and the engines boilers machinery and other fixtures etc from the trustees representing the creditors of the hallett  davis piano manufacturing company this lot was bounded by harrison avenue canton street a  wide passageway and brookline street the purchase price  in addition to the assumption of certain debts an outstanding mortgage of  given to the franklin savings bank obligations in the form of bonds held by royal m pulsifer amounting to  as well as taxes payable to the city of boston see  and  a surveyors drawing of the lot formed part of file  after an  fire had destroyed the hallett  davis factory it would be replaced by a new building on harrison avenue at the corner of brookline street about  workers were employed there circa pih a newspaper article dated in november of  reported john l whiting  son have plans in progress for alteration and possibly an addition to their brush factory corner of harrison avenue and east brookline street boston there will be a private electric plant from a new steam plantbb in  the officers of john l whiting  son company incorporated in massachusetts consisted of william s whiting president and treasurer and lew c hill secretary they were also directors along with anna m whiting a balance sheet as of june   was included in the report assetsliabilities of  with  being capital stock and the annual meeting was held in july from  through  there were no changes in the officers and directors william s whiting died on april   at his home in brookline on may   the john l whiting co conveyed its interest in the property on harrison avenue to mary b whiting president of the company see  she still continued to own the property on high street which had been subdivided and leased to several businesses also on may   a  year leasing arrangement was entered into whereby mary b whiting rented the harrison avenue property effective as of june june   to the john l whiting  son co for  per annum mary b whiting signed the document with the title of president and lew c hill signed as its treasurer see  the john l whiting  son co merged with the jj adams co and on july   the new company incorporated in the state of maine taking on the corporate name of john whiting  jj adams co with its principle place of business remaining as boston its registered agent was harry r virgin esq of portland who had been a state politician in maine and had served as president of the state senate in the early s was there a tax advantage for incorporating in maine regarding this merger it was stated in hills biography that the  consolidation again united the interests and resources of two concerns that had started a century before making it the largest brush manufacturing business in the world with plant and headquarters in bostonnc on july   the lease was assigned to the john l whiting  jj adams co with lew c hill vicepresident signing on behalf of john l whiting  son co and harvey w hascy signing for john l whiting  jj adams co see  as a result of the merger jj adams co moved its

secretary he was the son of william s whiting they were also directors of the corporation in addition to james h devereux of new york and walter irving bigelow of boston the authorized capital had been increased to  and the issued capital was  the origin of bigelows involvement is not known bigelow had been in the leather business of his father am bigelow  co until  at which time he formed a business broking firm in boston perhaps he had a hand in negotiating the merger or had participated in the financing of one of the business expansions it seems that  of the directors were hold overs from j j adams co and  others were tied to the intersets of the john l whiting  son co hill represented his personal ownership stake and whiting represented the interest of the whiting family members hascy probably represented his personal ownership although the full extent of same is not known on balance the numerical advantage favors the bostonbased group if bigelow sided with hill and whiting  also marked the passage by congress of federal tax legislation as well as in tax legislation being enacted in massachusetts an investment trust was created on january   named the john l whiting estate trust to hold manage and improve certain parcels of land these included the land and building at the corner of high and purchase streets in boston the land an building on harrison avenue in boston some property in newton mass near the boundary of th the brighton section of boston and a number of house lots in brockton mass serving as trustees were charles a sawin and anna m sawin this trust issued  shares with a par value  per share representing a total value of  the same properties were valued at about  in mrs whitings estate  shares each were subscribed to by the  surviving children and the remaining  was divided equally among the children of william s whiting this basic formula followed closely the manner in which mrs whitings estate had been settled see  from the  directory the only changes noted were an increase in the authorized capital to an amount  and the issued capital to it was not stated if another class of stock preferred andor stock with special voting rights had been issued it is assumed that some sort of increased business activity took place at about this time maybe these increases reflected the cost of financing the merger with the brooklyn company on march   the john l whiting  son company was dissolved by an act the massachusetts legislature during the years  through  there were no major changes in the management although according to the boston city directories of  and  allen s whiting secretary was residing in santa barbara california the  directory showed the following changes    lew c hill president    harry h hill vicepresident    harvey w hascy treasurer and    charles a sawin secretary they were also directors in addition to james h devereux and alexander h brawner both of new york and walter i bigelow of boston it appears that sawin replaced whiting in order to continue to represent the whiting members and their trust also the board of directors was increased by two seats with no shift in the advantage for the bostonbased group hills son was probably added only to offset the impact of brawners nomination brawner had been associated with the jj adams  co of brooklyn according to the new york city directory of  it is known that he had been an adams employee as early as  from  through  there were no changes reported anna m whiting died on march   her estate was valued at nearly  and it included  preferred shares and  common shares of the brush companys stock in addition she owned  shares in the family trust her position as trustee of the family trust may have been assumed by her nephew john whiting webber he was the oldest child of john l whitings only surviving child at this time the largest block of company shares were probably in control of william s whitings  children whose holdings may have increased through the bequests of their grandmother and  aunts and by the terms of the familys real estate trust a meeting of the board of directors was held on march   to propose that a massachusetts corporation be created according to the records of the massachusetts department of corporations and taxation on may   the john l whiting  jj adams co was incorporated with an authorized capital of  in preferred shares and  in common shares each class of shares had a par value of  a special meeting of the john l whiting  jj adams co was held at portland maine on may   as a corporation was about to be formed in mass for the purpose of buying out and continuing the business of this corporation that mass corporation was desirous of assuming and using as its corporate name john l whiting  jj adams co  the majority of stockholders voted their assent and those votes were cast by lew c hill harvey w hascy henry h hill walter i bigelow the clerk of the maine corporation was harry r virgincc according to the maine corporate records the company was excused as a corporation on may   it would appear that the whiting family was no longer active in the day to day operations after about  years with that responsibility now having shifted to the hill family the company itself probably reached its zenith several years ago coinciding with the end of the world war the  directory was not available and the directory for  the names of the officers and directors remained unchanged however in the directory for  the office of president was vacant lew c hill died on august   in boston from his obituarync it was learned that he had been born in fair haven vermont the son of clark phill and eliza m pratt hill he spent his boyhood fair haven saratoga new york and hammonton new jersey after public school he worked as an iron moulder and in  he went to boston he married clara kendall marcy of boston who had died in  he was a member of the exchange and home market clubs in boston as well as having belonged to the massachusetts charitable mechanic association he was survived by his second wife lillian j fischer of brooklyn new york whom he married in  she had been born on april   in brooklyn and the  sons from his first marriage henry horace and edward marcy he had owned a summer home in swampscott massachusetts and a farm in east holliston massachusetts the next president was harvey w hascy though the only reference to his having been so named was some correspondence in which the companys stationery had been usedjfw in  stanley cunningham was with the whiting  adams co he had been a note broker as well as a mechanical engineer in  he had been employed by the russell co general managers in the following year he was appointed a vicepresident and a director with that firm in  he was working at the industrial company which had strong ties with a highly prominent boston law firm  herrick smith donald  farley where arthur h weed would later become one of the partners the industrial company consulting engineers with a role in financing commercial ventures was organized in  by john wells farley of herrick smith in the  directory cunningham was with the industrial company and was associated with the ayerhouston corp as its president and a director in addition to being a vicepresident and director of the merrimac hat corp both of the latter firms were clients of herrick smith later cl stevens would become connected with some of the businesses managed by the industrial company it seems that the industrial company and others like it existed to rehabilitate problem businesses in order to sell them to others thereby profiting from the gain on the sale owing to their equity participation as well as through revenues derived from management fees frequently a law firm would act an intermediary between the troubled business and the consultants and it would not be unheard of if the law firm had an ownership in the consulting firm the  directory showed the following changes    henry h hill president    edward m hill vicepresident and secretary and    stanley cunningham treasurer they were also directors along with walter i bigelow of boston and james h devereux alex h tomes an owner of an importexport business in new york and xm audibert a member of gude winmill  co a stock brokerage in new york william s whitings daughter elizabeth was married to tomes and his daughter natalie was the wife of audibert brawner was no longer a director and he may have died at about that time he may have been born  it appears that the whiting  adams co had run into some financial difficulties and had hired an outside manager to analyze its weaknesses perhaps with the deaths of  officersdirectors a declining order book and stronger competition it was time for the new board of directors to seek a different corporate strategy while cunningham an outsider held the corporate purse strings his role was probably to implement and oversee cost control measures following a long illness harvey w hascy died on march   in brookline at the age of  the  directory showed the following changes    henry h hill president and general manager    edward m hill vicepresident and    stanley cunningham treasurer and secretary the other directors were the same as in the previous year according to the records of the massachusetts department of corporations and taxation on august   the john l whiting  jj adams companys corporate name became the whiting  adams company given the recent death of hascy maybe this change reflects how is interest in the business was transferred as a result of a meeting of the whiting stockholders on february    common shares were reserved and the muskegon corp was given an option to purchase those shares however that option had never been exercised and no shares had ever been issued the muskegon corp managing engineers had been created as a massachusetts corporation on september   as a result of the renaming of the stevens investment company which had been organized on february   on that same date the cl stevens company was organized as a massachusetts corporation on december   the muskegon corp was renamed as the stevens company which became the stevens corporation on january   charles leigh stevens was born on may   in muskegon michigan after attending cornell university he began his business career with charles bedaux who had achieved prominence as an important figure in the scientific management movement of the early th century stevens died on october   in cambridge massachusetts in  stevens had his offices on the same floor of a boston office building as did herrick smith and steven occupied the space formerly leased to sacolowell shops whose president was robert f herrick and a director of sacolowell had been stevens the  directory mentioned stevens for the first time as being the president of cl stevens company consulting engineers located at  federal street in boston in  the officers of the whiting  adams co were the same but sawin was replaced as a director by cl stevens of boston with all the events happening within the company in  as well as the collapsing of the national economy it seems that the control of the active management of the company has been assigned to stevens in  c l stevens became the preident of the whiting  adams co and edward m hill was its treasurer neither henry h hill nor stanley cunningham were mentioned although stevens was the president of the brush company his office was at  federal street in boston and he was also president of the following the stevens corp inc  cl stevens co consulting engineers inc  devon mfg co inc  stevens associates inc  also in  there were  new directors  arthur w weed of boston an attorney with herrick smith and mrs mary a whiting the widow of william s whiting the companys capital stock had been increased to  shares and the shares had no par value probably on account of the company being in dire financial straits it was forced to borrow  from the st national bank of boston as respects the directors of  there were  changes  bigelow was no longer a director and devereux had died on june   in northhampton massachusetts at age  at a meeting of the directors on march   the directors cl stevens em hill mary a whiting  ah tomes and  xm audibert voted to increase of capital stock by another  shares previously the total stood at  shares  shares being at a majority approved the increase of the  shares  shares were intended to be used for the conveyance of the harrison avenue property to the whiting  adams co it had been in a family trust  were to be used for payment to the stevens corp pursuant to the terms and conditions of a management contract which would become effective february   and  shares were to be made available to the stockholders of record as of march   such a sale was to be one on a proportional basis at  per share and the option must be exercised within  months in the  directory arthur h weed was a director of whiting  adams as well as a director of ayer  houston corp and of merrimac hat corp weed had been associated with the reed  prentice corp as its president in the years    and in  cl steven was the president of reedprentice while weed was one of its directors weed was also a director of devon mfg co as was stevens who was its president in the s the  directory showed the following for whiting  adams    cl stevens president office at  state street in boston and    edward m hill treasurer and secretary the other directors were alexander h tomes xm audibert and mrs mary a whiting all of whom were from new york in september of  the whiting trustees agreed to transfer the harrison avenue property to the whiting  adams co as the the bankk was demanding more surity for its loan the original loan amount had now been reduced to  at the same time the whiting trust lent to the brush company  which was to be paid back over a  year period the trustees were charles a sawin tomes and audibert in  there were no changes regarding the officers and directors it was noted that the capital stock stood at  shares at this same time the new york city directory showed that stevens had an office in new york with his representative being louis c farley in  there were no changes in  the following were the officers and directors    cl stevens president    arthur w leavitt vicepresident and general manager and    edward m hill treasurer and secretary the directors were mrs ma whiting ah tomes and xm audibert all of whom were from new york the  and  editions of the city directory had stevens living in new york according to the  directory the position of president was vacant however the president may have leavitt in  and in  in  stevens was in baltimore thus the stevens has certainly come to an end further evidence was seen in the  directory    xm audibert president and    edward m hill treasurer and secretary the directors were mrs mary a whiting and alexander h tomes highlighting the severity the companys financial plight was that even though the capital stock was valued at  there was surplus deficit of  in a letter to the commonwealths corporations department edward m hill treasurer stated that at a meeting of the stockholders on january   the directors gave their assent to a new business which would be known as whiting  adams company inc also on the same date the directors changed the corporate names to the marten corporation the directors of the marten corp were    irving l redfield president    edward m hill    roger c damon an assistant cashier at the st national bank    eugene t connolly an attorney with the firm of herrick smith donald  farley and    charles j winkler an attorney with the firm of bingham dana  gould it would seem that the marten corp was created as a vehicle to pave the way for the disposition of the assets of the brush company with the bank and other possible creditors in control the star brush manufacturing co of long island city new york and the whiting  adams co of boston effected a consolidation of interests unifying executive sales and production but will continue under their individual corporate namesnyt all manufacturing of star brush was transferred to boston star brush was started in  and was mainly a producer of inexpensive brushes alexander schumann president of star brush became the president of whiting  adams and lr schumann became the executive vicepresident retained were em hill treasurer and charles darby vicepresident of sales on october   the harrison avenue property was sold at public auction for  subject to the terms and conditions of an existing lease between the whiting  adams co and star brush manufacturing co dated february   see  et seq regarding the foreclosure and sale and  regarding the lease at about the same time of the whiting acquisition star brush bought the business of jc pushee  sons of boston pushee had been a brushmaker in boston as early as the s and previous to that in landisburg new york  further consolidating its position as a major producer of brushes their product mix was such that pushee made nylon bristle brushes whiting  adams made brushes for professional use and star brush continued to produce a line of inexpensive brushes in  a student research paper was written by an mit undergraduate in which a motion study was conducted using star brushs factory as the subject the manufacturing process of heavyline wall brushes was described and it was mentioned that this type of brush was intended for industrial use and had represented the most important brush in the product line   notes an early whiting  adams product catalogue is part of the collection of the henry ford museum at greenfield

district court judge virginia hopkins alexander had been charged in a may  indictment with one count of conspiracy and  counts of aiding and abetting wire fraud but in a plea agreement with the us attorneys office alexander pleaded guilty to one count of misprision  withholding information on a crime in exchange for his plea and cooperation with prosecutors the us attorneys office agreed to drop the charges in the indictment the plea agreement and todays guilty plea evidence mr alexanders acceptance of his responsibility in the sequence of events at adams produce company alexanders attorney augusta dowd stated in a prepared release mr alexander has been fully cooperative with the governments investigation into the wrongdoing at adams produce dowd stated alexander provided assistance to both the internal investigation and to the government and was one of the first adams produce officers to voluntarily meet with the us attorneys office assistant us attorney george martin declined to comment after wednesdays hearing attorneys for former coo steven craig finberg who also was indicted earlier this year also were monitoring wednesdays hearing the attorneys said that

scheme went like this adams produce had contracts with the defense logistics agency for the defense supply center in philadelphia to provide fruits and vegetables for use at military bases and schools the federal government would pay a certain price above what it would cost adams produce to get the produce from its suppliers adams produce was required to submit proof of its costs according to the indictment and other court documents certain adams produce officers and employees between august  and november  arranged transactions with the georgia location of tlc tom lange company a major nationwide wholesale produce company to create fraudulent purchase orders reflecting a higher cost to adams produce of purchasing fruits and vegetables adams officials then submitted the fraudulent purchase orders to the defense logistics agency as proof of what the produce cost on oct   alexander instructed kirkland and obrien  general manager for the adams produce distribution center in pensacola fla  to gradually end the scheme to defraud  telling them to bring it in for a soft landing  rather than ending it immediately so as to avoid raising red flags and better avoid detection by dla according to the indictment after the company filed bankruptcy a lawsuit was filed by adams produce shareholders against the accounting firm of frost cummings tidwell group which had audited the books of adams produce the suit claims the audit made the company seem healthier that it was inducing the investment firm to buy a majority stake in the company for  million a trial in the lawsuit was
