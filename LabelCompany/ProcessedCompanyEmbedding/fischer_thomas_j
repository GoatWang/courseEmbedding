negative experience with staff can make or break your infertility journey with that being said i believe dr donahue is an excellent physician and person but his office staff is terrible and insensitive i often felt very uneasy because most of the correspondence came from his  nurses whom i did not trust based on things that happened during my time there my husband and i felt that we were an inconvenience when we lost our babies which is a horrible shame we have since moved on to another specialist and love both the doctor and his staff from experience i can say this makes a huge difference please do your research sokol deborah k mddjprince rateddr deborah sokol has been takdr deborah sokol has been taking care of my sons epilepsy for a while now she does real well with him as long as she has time to go through his file first or someone me refreshes her memory about him each and every time you go there she forgets to write prescriptions with all the legal requirments so you have trouble getting them filled this doctor is ok in a pinch but i suggest trying to find one that will actually try to acquaint themselves with your child prior to suggesting med reductions or discontinuations be careful with this one be your childs full time active advocate or your child gets lost in the shufflerani dolly mdrena b ratedi was diagnosed with hyperactive thyroidism by dr

to call if i ever needed anything we were very impresses with the care i receivedst vincents hospitalhaley l ratedi am a patient in the family and medicine clinic i want to start off by saying that i love my doctor the problem that i have with this facility is the front office team especially yolanda she is extremely rude every time i come in the front office team does not acknowledge that they have patients standing right in front of them it takes yolanda five minutes or more to check me in she never makes eye contact never smiles and always has an attitude it is extremely unprofessional she lacks customer service skillsindiana university med ctr tahiri hassani youssef mdjenny o ratedi was the mother of a newborn with pierre robin sequence and a cleft palate that was found out at

online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if

be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on we just redesigned ypcom do you like it×
