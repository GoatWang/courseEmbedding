wellrounded property weve ever seen this is the way family properties used to be valley view is the perfect combination of a working piece of land with great recreation and beauty with its industrial

property plus the hbu this is undoubtedly the one to top it off for the right buyer we see annual rent returns already being offered for  here you have major wealth between the phosphate reserves and construction debris permits all at one of the last undeveloped interchanges left on i yet at the same time the property is beautiful with lakes wood cabins and live oaks – from jon kohler valley view is a rare gem and the seller has priced it right where we told him he needed it to be for a quick sale it took nearly  years to create this oneofakind property that is beautiful and as a whole throws off income and has massive opportunity and appreciation potential like we havent seen in decades the seller will gladly divide and hold onto portions of this property essentially what we have here is a great beautiful property that just so happens to be part of the northwest quadrant of one of the last undeveloped interchanges along i between tallahassee and jacksonville – from erica hanway my first impression of valley view was that no other piece of land would ever seem as wellcapitalized as this one i could see owning this property and creating generational wealth i felt safe here and in this community and the property being highfenced didnt hurt either i could picture enjoying the lakes and the nicely built lodges with friends and family this isnt just a beautiful recreational

posted on january   leave a comment in addition to the brick house in springfield i also prepared the national register nomination for valley view an  greek revival mansion located near romney wv valley view is the home of bob and kim mayhew another couple of fantastic historichome owners who bent over backwards to help me with my research they also let me investigate every nook and cranny of their home and in true west virginia smallworld fashion we discovered that bob knew my late grandfather from our family limestone quarry business outside of romney valley view was built in  by james a “big jim” parsons jr big jim’s father james and his mother catherine casey both came from prominent families that owned thousands of acres in hampshire county big jim’s inheritance was a large tract of land he moved onto it in  around the time he married elizabeth miller big jim was known as an honorable and upstanding citizen in the community he and his wife had  children many of whom attended college in  he built his grand farm estate home in the latest fashionable architectural style greek revival for a prominent land owner the formality and grand proportions of a greek revival home would have been a social and financial statement the parsons children made their own mark on the house in the form of graffiti on the attic stairwell structure well one man’s graffiti is an historian’s valuable significant historic feature unfortunately the construction of the home caused a financial burden upon the parsons family and big jim was only able enjoy his home for three years before he died of tuberculosis his wife and children remained until  then sold the property to charles and elizabeth harmison it was elizabeth who gave the house the very appropriate name “valley view” the house remained in the harmison family until  when the mayhews bought it as only the third owners the mayhews have remained devoted to preserving the historic nature of the building while updating it for modern use in the field of historic preservation there can be a perception that historic homes should be frozen in time as museums it is always heartening to have examples of homeowners who have kept a house vibrant and alive as a comfortable home while acting as responsible stewards of the past on that note please remember that valley view is a private home and is not open to the public you can always find more pictures in the national register nomination valley view is an exemplary local midth century home with deep ties to historicallyimportant families in the south branch valley the house’s greek revival design and excellent integrity convey a value of prosperity formality and order combined with an appreciation of the surrounding land the house is locally significant under criterion c for architecture you can read the national register nomination by clicking here valley view’s symmetry and bold simple proportions are characteristic of greek revival the back elevation makes the most of the beautiful “valley view” with a twostory fullwidth porch the main entrance is typical greek revival with its templelike roof and trabeated threesided door frame historic  graffiti
