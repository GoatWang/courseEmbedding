to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm

metrics on the back of several large deals in its fq which apparently had become the expectation given publicly disclosed large deals walmart and others driving the stock up to greater than  from  after last quarters conference call guidance for next year was raised and implies conservatism our opinion workday has adopted asc  for f   stifel nicolaus analysts commented after the close on monday workday delivered a strong print to end the year that included total revenue subscription revenue operating margins and reported billings coming in ahead of both managements guidance and consensus estimates more importantly managements tone on the call saw a marked improvement from last quarter after business bounced backed strongly in december and january following heightened customer uncertainty in midoctobernovember that was reportedly tied to brexit and the recent us presidential election in fact despite this temporary lull workday posted its strongest quarter in history that saw the company finish with  hcm customers  in the fortune   of which were added in q alone  financials customers up over  yy and  and  planning and learning customers respectively despite both products only being in the market for two quarters   canaccord genuity analysts commented last nights earnings call introduced some complexity to the story workday adopted asc  a full year early the firm wont guide calculated billings because the new accounting rules and increasing seasonality of the business makes that metric even less reliable and instead the firm offered an annual operating cash flow guide and oh yes workday replaced its head of sales with an internal candidate from an execution standpoint lets make this less complex in the span of five months workday has signed walmart amazon deutsche bank and bp as customers thats impressive while the new accounting rules will certainly create some confusion workday has the blessing of showing prospective customers that its software can handle the new accounting regulations but the curse of being the first child from which investors will learn meanwhile we reject the notion that anything but fundamentals eventually set stock prices therefore we acknowledge but respectfully disagree with a possible subset of investors who might flip out if now utterly unguided billings or whatever nonmaterial metric is askew in the next few quarters what we strongly believe from our independent checks on workday is that the firm is very likely to close enough deals to propel the firms revenue growth toward  for at least the next two years if our assessment is correct workday will join salesforce as the second cloud software firm to achieve sufficient scale to reach what we have called escape velocity  another way of saying that the big incumbents wont be able to kill the firm off and taking our scenario to the next logical step workdays success or failure will therefore rest in its own hands not the pricing and marketing machinations of firms from redwood city or walldorf we are bullish on wday and we become particularly aggressive in the stock on pullbacks  who are some of workdays key competitors some

liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm
