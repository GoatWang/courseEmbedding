other synergiesthe biohitech story continues to get better and better  this startup is highly unique and executing at a level ive rarely ever seenbiohitech global otcqbbhtg a microcap ive been tracking from the outside no position currently is out with a nice update regarding its product portfolio and potential tam for those unfamiliar biohitech is a cleantech company that provides datadriven solutions for disposal of food  or put simply it provides a combination datamonitoring platform as well as a digester to customers that converts food waste to grey water grey water is a natural waste product that can be transported to waste water treatment facilities via traditional municipal sewer systems rather than by truck eliminating the usage of trucks helps lowers operational costs for building owners and helps reduce the ancillary liabilities associated with storage capacity equipment and associated human capital summarized biohitech helps fix a meaningful cost at a lower net overhead number that of course matters greatly to the building owner tethered to such costs biohitech has also recently expanded its data collection and analysis capacity and is now able to meaningful in a quantifiable way contribute to humancapital productivity management and overall humancapital cost management on may   biohitech announced that it launched its new subsidiary entsorga north america entsorga north america which will manage apple valley waste conversions llc an entsorga north america partowned subsidiary possesses an exclusive license to deploy proprietary entsorga hebiot mechanical biological treatment nysembt technology throughout the northeastern united states the hebiot mbt system converts food waste plastics and other carbon based materials from the mixed municipal solid waste nasdaqmsw stream into an epa recognized alternative fuel source its important to note that the structuring of entsorga north america  having it only partially own the managed subco apple valley waste conversions llc  will mean the biohitech subco entsorga north america is a subco that will have substantially no assets or liabilities other than the license to deploy entsorga mbt technology currently biohitechs fleet of deployed digesters does not possess the capacity to convert to traditional municipal sewer system acceptable waste product plastics and other carbon based materials that are not considered food waste definitively the subsidiary launch of entsorga north america is a total addressable market multiplier and a massive product portfolio addition this is before considering the dataanalytics capture expansion this positions biohitech for on a goforward basis something ill elaborate on later using the new entsorga north americasubco based technology waste received at a facility will be converted to a clean burning alternative fuel solid recovered fuel or srf which will be used as an alternative or supplement to fossil fuels srf is ideal for coprocessing plants such as cement kilns and steel mills as well as coal fired power plants as a source for the production of renewable energy the entsorga mbt technology creates an environmental protection agency eparecognized engineered fuel this means that facilities using this specific srf as an alternative fuel will not be subject to the epa incinerator rule commercialindustrial solid waste incinerator rule and that the srf meets certain standards that other fuels cannot meet frank celli biohitech ceo stated in a press release announcing the subco launch we now have the ability to expand our solutions to provide economically feasible alternatives for organic and inorganic waste disposal to all generators including businesses and municipalities we will deploy this exciting technology along with our ecosafe digesters throughout the united states providing a one stop solution to our customers clearly i would agree and yet again biohitech has done the hard to imagine for a startup of its size so far into my coverage of biohitech ive opined on its databased dataled dataquantifiable valueprop to customers as being the reason to consider investment andor to consider following the story celli who i chat with often in following the narrative calls this startups if you cant measure it you cant manage it message a message that clearly is resonating with its expanding client base with the subco launch of entsorga north america which will have a completed processing facility erected in martinsburg west virginia in the spring of  biohitech can begin to seed and expand into an entirely new inorganic waste market  one that i believe will take to the databased dataquantifiable value prop as well as its predecessor has it should be noted the west virginia facility is being erected via a  million taxexempt bond issued by the west virginia economic development authority this facility is being erected at no cost to biohitech outside of its licensing agreement in that its subco entsorga north america is partially owned by the actual owner of the entsorga mbt technology who is responsible for the facility and facility financing dynamic details of biohitechs subco license as well as economics of the license are available via a recently updated investor presentation posted to the biohitech investor relations website the license from my review appears to be one in which biohitech is paid for throughput provided considering biohitechs considerable existing volume and potential volume scale over the immediate and midterm these throughput revenues could very quickly add up while not wanting to assume too large an economic impact at least in the immediate andor midterm i do think its safe to assume some level of economic contribution from this licensing agreementsubco launch  especially longerterm  in that now biohitech has a comprehensive complete product ecosystem that runs the full spectrum of organic and inorganic waste biohitech can now scale to whatever level its diverse customer base wants to scale to of course taking into account current size and balance sheet constraints without having productbased capacitybased constraints  which is huge biohitech also now has a secondary product to  sell when meeting new prospects  potentially increasing total ticket andor recurring revenue capture and  to sell back into its book those with sales backgrounds know that selling back into a book of clients is generally easier to do meaning the sales calls close at higher rates than new sales and do well to increase retention both should do well to drive overall financials over time even using the most conservative of assumptions at biohitech one can reasonably assume a fair amount of operating leverage being realized from  increased sales team productivity on a per dollar basis per dollar of cash ga as a result of whats been outlined above and  other synergistic effects of having an expanded product portfolio again biohitech wont even begin to monetize this tech until spring   but it can sure seed the new market it can target as well as take lois until then all told this is yet another maturation point that i think investors should take careful note of in regards to the biohitech story biohitech on the heels of its best quarter in company history continues to execute and continues to build out a real business a databased dataled quantifiable valueprop having business with its client base just now beginning to express confidence in the name via expanded orders and follow on additions to existing fleet delivery i think biohitech has a superb future in front of it the buildout of the tam and the product portfolio should embellish already in the works growth drivers at the company outlined by ceo frank celli here increased traction of and expansion of the biohitech cloud and biohitech cirrus biohitechs two prong analytics platform international expansion latin america asia etc via partners and expansion of artificial intelligence capacity via the introduction of dataanalytics bots as described by frank celli if you can add a starter position in the highlyilliquid stock

commercial scale would allow it a potential renewable energy vertical entry biohitech’s proof of concept partner natural systems utilities has been able to show successful “early trials” to which

global otcpkbhtg a microcap ive been tracking from the outside no position currently is out with a nice update regarding its product portfolio and potential tam for those unfamiliar biohitech is a cleantech company that provides datadriven solutions for disposal of food  or put simply it provides a digester to customers that converts food waste to grey water grey water is a natural waste product that can be transported to waste water treatment facilities via traditional municipal sewer systems rather than by truck eliminating the usage of trucks helps lowers operational costs for building owners and helps reduce the ancillary liabilities associated with storage capacity equipment and associated human capital summarized biohitech helps fix a meaningful cost at a lower net overhead number that of course matters greatly to the building owner tethered to such costs yes the business model at biohitech is currently that simple but as simple as biohitechs story seems its really not that simple the recent update from the company is a perfect example biohitech is out with news that its launching a proof of concept effort  currently at just labscale  for a product portfolio addition that will allow biohitechs ecosafe digester to digest tank and deliver the grey water from its ecosafe digesters to anaerobic digestion ad facilities anywhere in the world thats right anywhere in the world but why does this matter wheres the monetization event well outside of this effort adding to the overall capacity and product portfolio at the company  if proof of concept milestones can be hit and if biohitech can scale this concept up to commercial levels  this effort also expands the total addressable market that can be targeted by the company biohitechs proof of concept efforts again if ultimately proven successful at commercial scale would allow it to tank its units grey water which would allow for transportation to an anaerobic digestion plant where biogas can be captured and used to create renewable energy biohitechs proof of concept partner natural systems utilities has been able to show successful early trials likely single instances at less than labscale in which feeding the material to a digester have been successful natural systems utilities will leverage its prior data with biohitechs intellectual capital and operating prowess in an effort to prove concept at higher scale i think its premature to be anything but optimistic from a speculative standpoint but im going to be following these developments very closely with alternativerenewable energy still a huge focus of government funding efforts and with it now in light of whats taken place in traditional energy tm becoming a major nontraditional capital focus pe vc etc i could see biohitech and co marketing any early proof of concept to funding effort success unlike many alternativerenewable energy efforts what biohitech is trying to do at least with this particular segment is more of an operating process than an exercise in science biohitech is simply dialing in the efficacy of its digester  biohitech will need to leave its digestion process at different stages of being incomplete for this effort to prove concept  rather than inventing or creating additional processes via operating processes or science that derisks this effort greatly in my opinion still though if biohitech can successfully prove concept it should be able to qualify for process tethered ip read patent protection for the process that matters from a valuation standpoint when trying to figure out what this vertical could generate longer term again ill wait to do that until were further down the development road all told i thought the update from biohitech was productive i think it shows that theres more to the story of the companys digester than meets the eye and i think it shows that biohitech has target markets that are proactively looking for solutions that matters its one thing to be government mandated into a solution  or a cost uptick for that matter  but its a completely different story to want to find a solution to a problem from a proactive basis from my background in consulting ive learned that the easiest way to sell a product is to sell it to a market thats already looking for it or something like it it looks like biohitech might be on the road to doing just that for a very very large market good luck everybody risks biohitech is a microcap with shares traded over the counter where liquidity is often light low liquidity is one of the reasons the stock is so cheap you can buy the stock well below fair value but that also means you may have a problem selling at fair value or at all in the future because of the illiquidity in the shares you should only enter a position if you wont need the money in the near term secondly there is competition the overall sector in which the company operates is competitive and almost all the competitors in biohitechs space are much better funded have longer track records of operations and are in a better position to access the credit markets third there is execution risk if management does try to significantly grow the business and increase market share organically by increasing expenses the plan could suffer setbacks and the company could be forced to raise capital on inferior terms if it can raise capital at all disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it expresses
