chicago illinois and to lay off onethird of the companys member corporate staff wesley said that these costsaving measures which cut  million in annual expenses showed company shareholders that top management did not need to live in such opulent surroundings growth initiatives in the following years during which wesley acted as the head of fortune brands he saw the company grow thanks in large part to his aggressive investments in its leading brands the company also gained strong market shares with new products and expanded customer relationships wesley was able to supplement the companys growth initiatives with highreturn acquisitions such as the maumee ohio–based thermatru company a leading us designer and manufacturer of residential entry doors and omega holdings a maker of cabinets with divestitures such as the sale of the european division of jim beam brands and with sharegain initiatives such as winning the contract to build thomasville cabinets for home depot the

expand fortune brands fastgrowing home and hardware business wesley was excited with the innovative and growing thermatru brand and its strategic fit within a division already populated by moen masterbrand cabinets master lock and waterloo industries indeed wesleys addition of thermatru created opportunities for valuable sales growth and cost reductions within the division strong momentum wesley reported that annual results in  benefited from extensive share gains supplychain efficiencies highreturn acquisitions and favorable foreign exchange in fact wesley said that the company finished another excellent year with strong momentum as each of its businesses performed at or above expectations specifically wesley saw strong demand with aristokraft kensington master lock moen

wesley reported that the companys operating income was  million up  percent free cash flow was  million after dividends and capital expenditures and return on invested capital was  percent fortune brands prosperity was partially due to wesleys emphasis on advertising wesley regularly reduced costs within the company whether the economy was good or bad so that when demand eventually slacked off—as it did in the first few years of —the company was financially able to continue spending on advertisements such expenditures were critical in wesleys opinion to the longterm success of the company doubledigit growth at the beginning of  wesley reported that the company was expecting to comfortably achieve its longterm goal of doubledigit growth in diluted earnings per share before charges and gains along with expecting a continuation of improvements in returns great results for the branded business came from the reinvigorated management team wesley developed during his reign he

venture with the swedenbased vin  sprit although the company seemed to extend in four different directions with its four divisions wesley was adamant that distinctions between them were not noticeable

maintain doubledigit growth in earnings in all  percent of fortune brands sales were derived from an array of brands that were ranked first or second in their respective product categories leading for the future the former fortune brands chairman and ceo thomas c hays and the former president and coo john t ludes selected wesley in order to allow for an orderly management transition with the

years that hes been associated with our company norm has performed superbly well in a series of key assignments including nine years as chief executive officer of our office products business most recently he has led our home and office businesses to strong growth capitalizing on overall opportunities while also successfully integrating high return addon acquisitions under norms leadership the home and office brands which generated  percent of our  sales have flourished september   one of the first belttightening actions taken by wesley was to move the corporate headquarters from its lavish property in old greenwich connecticut to utilitarian surroundings in suburban chicago illinois and to lay off onethird of the companys member corporate staff wesley said that these costsaving measures which cut  million in annual expenses showed company shareholders that top management did not need to live in such opulent surroundings growth initiatives in the following years during which wesley acted as the head of fortune brands he saw the company grow thanks in large part to his aggressive investments in its leading brands the company also gained strong market shares with new products and expanded customer relationships wesley was able to supplement the companys growth initiatives with highreturn acquisitions such as the maumee ohio–based thermatru company a leading us designer and manufacturer of residential entry doors and omega holdings a maker of cabinets with divestitures such as the sale of the european division of jim beam brands and with sharegain initiatives such as winning the contract to build thomasville cabinets for home depot the wellperforming homecenter chain with the completion of the acquisition of thermatru a marketleading company in the design and manufacture of entry doors wesley declared that the new addition would expand fortune brands fastgrowing home and hardware business wesley was excited with the innovative and growing thermatru brand and its strategic fit within a division already populated by moen masterbrand cabinets master lock and waterloo industries indeed wesleys addition of thermatru created opportunities for valuable sales growth and cost reductions within the division strong momentum wesley reported that annual results in  benefited from extensive share gains supplychain efficiencies highreturn acquisitions and favorable foreign exchange in fact wesley said that the company finished another excellent year with strong momentum as each of its businesses performed at or above expectations specifically wesley saw strong demand with aristokraft kensington master lock moen omega titleist and its premium liquors which provided the strongest sales growth within the year in a press release wesley stated in all  was a year of broadbased success that extended fortune brands track record of consistently strong performance and that significantly surpassed the goals we set a year ago january   wesley reported at the end of  that for the full year the companys net income grew  percent to  million net sales were at  billion up  percent acquisitions and divestitures helped sales by about  percent and positive foreign exchange rates benefited sales by about  percent wesley reported that the companys operating income was  million up  percent free cash flow was  million after dividends and capital expenditures and return on invested capital was  percent fortune brands prosperity was partially due to wesleys emphasis on advertising wesley regularly reduced costs within the company whether the economy was good or bad so that when demand eventually slacked off—as it did in the first few years of —the company was financially able to continue spending on advertisements such expenditures were critical in wesleys opinion to the longterm success of the company doubledigit growth at the beginning of  wesley reported that the company was expecting to comfortably achieve its longterm goal of doubledigit growth in diluted earnings per share before charges and gains along with expecting a continuation of improvements in returns great results for the branded business came from the
