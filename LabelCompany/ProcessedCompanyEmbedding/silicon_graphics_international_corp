kurt akeley ed mccracken thomas jermoluk products highperformance computing visualization and storage website wwwsgicom silicon graphics inc later rebranded sgi historically known as silicon graphics computer systems or sgcs was an american highperformance computing manufacturer producing computer hardware and software founded in mountain view california in november  by jim clark its initial market was d graphics computer workstations but its products strategies and market positions developed significantly over time early systems were based on the geometry engine that clark and marc hannah had developed at stanford university and were derived from clarks broader background in computer graphics the geometry engine was the first verylargescale integration vlsi implementation of a geometry pipeline specialized hardware that accelerated the innerloop geometric computations needed to display threedimensional images for much of its history the company focused on d imaging and were a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market they reincorporated as a delaware corporation in january  through the mid to lates the rapidly improving performance of commodity wintel machines began to erode sgis stronghold in the d market the porting of maya to other platforms is a major event in this process sgi made several attempts to address this including a disastrous move from their existing mips platforms to the intel itanium as well as introducing their own linuxbased intel ia based workstations and servers that failed in the market in the mids the company repositioned itself as a supercomputer vendor a move that also failed on april   sgi filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to

clusters of linux and bsdbased pcs to take on many of the tasks of larger sgi servers ate into sgis core markets the porting of maya to linux mac os x and microsoft windows further eroded the low end of sgis product line in response to challenges faced in the marketplace and a falling share price ed mccracken was fired and sgi brought in richard belluzzo to replace him under belluzzos leadership a number of initiatives were taken which are considered to have accelerated the corporate decline one such initiative was trying to sell workstations running windows nt called visual workstations instead of just ones which ran irix the companys version of unix this put the company in even more direct competition with the likes of dell making it more difficult to justify a price premium the product line was unsuccessful and abandoned a few years later sgis premature announcement of its migration from mips to itanium and its abortive ventures into ia architecture systems the visual workstation line the exintergraph zx range and the sgi series linux servers damaged sgis credibility in the market in  in an attempt to clarify their current market position as more than a graphics company silicon graphics inc changed its corporate identity to sgi although its legal name was unchanged at the same time sgi announced a new logo consisting of only the letters sgi in a proprietary font called sgi created by branding and design consulting firm landor associates in collaboration with designer joe stitzlein the new logo drew criticism for wasting the professional goodwill associated with the previous cube logo or bugcitation needed sgi continued to use the silicon graphics name for its workstation product line and later readopted the cube logo for some workstation models in november  sgi announced that it had been delisted from the new york stock exchange because its common stock had fallen below the minimum share price for listing on the exchange sgis market capitalization dwindled from a peak of over seven billion dollars in  to just  million at the time of delisting in february  sgi noted that it could run out of cash by the end of the year reemergenceedit in mid sgi hired alix partners to advise it on returning to profitability and received a new line of credit sgi announced it was postponing its scheduled annual december stockholders meeting until march  it proposed a reverse stock split to deal with the delisting from the new york stock exchange in january  sgi hired dennis mckenna as its new ceo and chairman of the board of directors mr mckenna succeeded robert bishop who remained vice chairman of the board of directors on may   sgi announced that it had filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection for itself and us subsidiaries as part of a plan to reduce debt by  million two days later the us bankruptcy court approved its first day motions and its use of a  million financing facility provided by a group of its bondholders foreign subsidiaries were unaffected on september   sgi announced the end of development for the mipsirix line and the irix operating system production would end on  december and the last orders would be fulfilled by march  support for these products would end after december  sgi emerged from bankruptcy protection on october   its stock symbol at that point sgidpk was canceled and new stock was issued on the nasdaq exchange under the symbol sgic this new stock was distributed to the companys creditors and the sgid common stockholders were left with worthless shares at the end of that year the company moved its headquarters from mountain view to sunnyvale its earlier north shoreline headquarters is now occupied by the computer history museum the newer amphitheater parkway headquarters was sold to google both of these locations were awardwinning designs by studios architecturecitation needed in april  sgi reentered the visualization market with the sgi virtu range of

linux suse linux enterprise server or windows compute cluster server final bankruptcy and acquisition by rackable systemsedit in december  sgi received a delisting notification from nasdaq as its market value had been below the minimum  million requirement for  consecutive trading days and also did not meet nasdaqs alternative requirements of a minimum stockholders equity of  million or annual net income from continuing operations of  or more on april   sgi filed for chapter  again and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to rackable systems for  million the sale ultimately for  million was finalized on may   at the same time rackable announced their adoption of silicon graphics international as their global name and brand the bankruptcy court scheduled continuing proceedings and hearings for june  and   and july  needs update after the rackable acquisition vizworld magazine published a series of six articles that chronicle the downfall of sgi

starting with the iris integrated raster imaging system  series of highperformance graphics terminals were based on the motorola  family of microprocessors the later iris  and  models developed into full unix workstations iris  seriesedit the first entries in the  series models  and  introduced in  were graphics terminals peripherals to be connected to a generalpurpose computer such as a digital equipment corporation vax to provide graphical raster display abilities they used  mhz motorola  cpus with  kb of ram and had no disk drives they booted over the network via an excelan exos ethernet card from their controlling computer they used the pm cpu board which was a variant of the board that was used in stanford universitys sun workstation and later in the sun workstation from sun microsystems the graphics system was composed of the gf frame buffer the uc update controller dc display controller and the bp bitplane the series machines were designed around the multibus standard later series machines the  and  ran at  mhz and had  mb of ram the  had a  mb st disk drive while the  had a  mb smdbased disk drive with a xylogics  disk controller they may have used the pm cpu and pmm ram board from the  series the usual monitor for the  series ran at  hz interlaced six betatest units of the  workstation were produced and the first production unit sgis first commercial computer was shipped to carnegiemellon universitys electronic imaging laboratory in  iris  and  seriesedit geometry engine chip from an iris  sgi rapidly developed its machines into workstations with its second product line — the iris  series first released in august  sgi began using the unix system v operating system there were five models in two product ranges the  range which used  cpus the pm cpu module and the later turbo systems the t t and t which had s the ip cpu module all used the excelan exos ethernet card the same graphics hardware gf frame buffer uc update controller dc display controller bp bitplane their main differences were the cpu ram and weitek floating point accelerator boards disk controllers and disk drives both st and smd were available these could be upgraded for example from a  to a t the  and t had a larger chassis a standard   eia rack with space at the bottom for two smd disk drives weighing approximately  kg each the nonturbo models used the multibus for the cpu to communicate with the floating point accelerator while the turbos added a ribbon cable dedicated for this  hz monitors were used for the  series the height of the machines using motorola cpus was reached with the iris  series models  and  the s both being fullsize rack machines they used the same graphics subsystem and ethernet as the s but could also use up to  geometry engines the first widespread use of hardware graphics accelerators the standard monitor was a   hz noninterlaced unit with a tiltswivel base   hz interlaced and a   hz noninterlaced with tiltswivel base were also available the iris  and its smaller siblings were impressive for the time being complete unix workstations the  was powerful enough to support a complete d animation and rendering package without mainframe support with large capacity hard drives by standards of the day two  mb drives streaming tape and ethernet it could be the centerpiece of an animation operation the line was formally discontinued in november  with about  systems shipped of all  and  models combined risc eraedit with the introduction of the iris d series sgi switched to mips microprocessors these machines were more powerful and came with powerful onboard floatingpoint capability as d graphics became more popular in television and film during this time these systems were responsible for establishing much of sgis reputation sgi produced a broad range of mipsbased workstations and servers during the s running sgis version of unix system v now called irix these included the massive onyx visualization systems the size of refrigerators and capable of supporting up to  processors while managing up to three streams of high resolution fully realized d graphics in october  mips announced the first commercially available bit microprocessor the r sgi used the r in its crimson workstation irix  was the first fully bit irix release including bit pointers to secure the supply of future generations of mips microprocessors the bit r sgi acquired the company in  for  million and renamed it as mips technologies inc a wholly owned subsidiary of sgi in  silicon graphics sgi signed a deal with nintendo to develop the cpu used in the nintendo  a derivative of the ri microprocessor though the deal was signed in early  it was not made public until august of that year and the console itself would not be released until  in  relinquished mips technologies inc in a reipo in the late s when much of the industry expected the itanium to replace both cisc and risc architectures in nonembedded computers sgi announced their intent to phase out mips in their systems development of new mips microprocessors stopped and the existing r design was extended multiple times until  to provide existing customers more time to migrate to itanium in august  sgi announced the end of production for mipsirix systems and by the end of the year mipsirix products were no longer generally available from sgi iris gl and opengledit until the second generation onyx reality engine machines sgi offered access to its high performance d graphics subsystems through a proprietary api known as iris graphics language iris gl as more features were added over the years iris gl became harder to maintain and more cumbersome to use in  sgi decided to clean up and reform iris gl and made the bold move of allowing the resulting opengl api to be cheaply licensed by sgis competitors and set up an industrywide consortium to maintain the opengl standard the opengl architecture review board this meant that for the first time fast

nominated for an academy award for distinguished achievement in visual effects were created on silicon graphics computer systems once inexpensive pcs began to have graphics performance close to the more expensive specialized graphical workstations which were sgis core business sgi shifted its focus to high performance servers for digital video and the web many sgi graphics engineers left to work

purchased alias research and wavefront technologies in a deal totaling approximately  million and merged the companies into aliaswavefront in june  sgi sold the business later renamed to alias systems corporation to the private equity investment firm accelkkr for  million in october  autodesk announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire alias for  million in cash in february  sgi purchased the wellknown supercomputer manufacturer cray research for  million and began to use marketing names such as craylink for sgideveloped technology integrated into the sgi server line three months later it sold crays business systems division responsible for the cs sparcsolaris server to sun microsystems for an undisclosed amount widely believed to be  million many of the cray te engineers designed and developed the sgi altix and numalink technology sgi sold the cray brand and product lines to tera computer company on march   for  million plus one million shares sgi also distributed its remaining interest in mips technologies through a spinoff effective june   in september  sgi acquired the zx series of windows workstations and servers from intergraph computer systems

workstations running windows nt or red hat linux see also sgi visual workstation proved to be a financial disaster and shook customer confidence in sgi’s commitment to its own mipsbased line switch to itaniumedit in  sgi announced that future generations of its machines would be based not on their own mips processors but the upcoming superchip from intel codenamed merced and later called itanium funding for its own highend processors was reduced and it was planned that the r would be the last mips mainstream processor mips technologies would focus entirely on the embedded market where it was having some success and sgi would no longer have to fund development of a cpu that since the failure of arc found use only in their own machines this plan quickly went awry as early as  it was clear the itanium was going to be delivered very late and would have nowhere near the performance originally expected as the production delays increased mips existing rbased machines grew increasingly uncompetitive eventually it was forced to introduce faster mips processors the r r and r which were used in a series of models from  through  sgis first itaniumbased system was the shortlived sgi  workstation launched in  sgis mipsbased systems were not to be superseded until the launch of the itanium based altix servers and prism workstations some time later unlike the mips systems which ran irix the itanium systems used suse linux enterprise server with sgi enhancements as their operating system sgi used transitive corporations quicktransit software to allow their old mipsirix applications to run in emulation on the new itaniumlinux platform in the server market the itanium based altix eventually replaced the mipsbased origin product line in the workstation market the switch to itanium was not completed before sgi exited the market the altix was the most powerful computer in the world in  assuming that a computer is defined as a collection of hardware running under a single instance of an operating system the altix had  itanium processors running under a single instance of linux a cluster of  machines was then the eighthfastest supercomputer all faster supercomputers were clusters but none have as many flops per machine however more recent supercomputers are very large clusters of machines that are individually less capable sgi acknowledged this and in  moved away from the massive numa model to clusters switch to xeonedit although sgi continued to market itaniumbased machines its more recent machines were based on the intel xeon processor the first altix xe systems were relatively lowend machines but by december  the xe systems were more capable than the itanium machines by some measures eg power consumption in flopsw density in flopsm costflops the xe and xe servers used a cluster architecture this was a departure from the pure numa architectures of the earlier itanium and mips servers in june  sgi announced the altix ice  a

government and defense applications energy and scientific and technical computing the rise of cheap yet powerful commodity workstations running linux windows and mac os x and the availability of diverse professional software for them effectively pushed sgi out of the visual effects industry in all but the most niche markets highend server marketedit sgi continued to enhance its line of servers including some supercomputers based on the sn architecture sn for scalable node is a technology developed by sgi in the mids that uses cachecoherent nonuniform memory access ccnuma in an sn system processors memory and a bus and memorycontroller are coupled together into an entity called a node usually on a single circuit board nodes are connected by a highspeed interconnect called numalink originally marketed as craylink there is no internal bus and instead access between processors memory and io devices is done through a switched fabric of links and routers thanks to the cache coherence of the distributed shared memory sn systems scale along several axes at once as cpu count increases so does memory capacity io capacity and system bisection bandwidth this allows the combined memory of all the nodes to be accessed under a single os image using standard sharedmemory synchronization methods this makes an sn system far easier to program and able to achieve higher sustainedtopeak performance than noncachecoherent systems like conventional clusters or massively parallel computers which require applications code to be written or rewritten to do explicit messagepassing communication between their nodes the first sn system known as sn was released in  under the product name origin  based on the mips r processor it scaled from  to  processors and a smaller version the origin  sn scaled from  to  later enhancements enabled systems of as large as  processors the second generation system originally called sn but later snmips was released in july  as the origin  it scaled from  to  processors and processor configurations were delivered by special order to some customers a smaller less scalable implementation followed called origin  in november  sgi announced a repackaging of its sn system under the name origin  it quadrupled the processor area density of the snmips system from  up to  processors per rack while moving to a fat tree interconnect topology in january  sgi announced a variant of the sn platform called the altix  internally called snia it used intel itanium  processors and ran the linux operating system kernel at the time it was released it was the worlds most scalable linuxbased computer supporting up to  processors in a single system node nodes could be connected using the same numalink technology to form what sgi predictably termed superclusters in february  sgi announced general support for  processor nodes to be followed by  and  processor versions that year in april  sgi announced the sale of its alias

clark kurt akeley ed mccracken thomas jermoluk products highperformance computing visualization and storage website wwwsgicom silicon graphics inc later rebranded sgi historically known as silicon graphics computer systems or sgcs was an american highperformance computing manufacturer producing computer hardware and software founded in mountain view california in november  by jim clark its initial market was d graphics computer workstations but its products strategies and market positions developed significantly over time early systems were based on the geometry engine that clark and marc hannah had developed at stanford university and were derived from clarks broader background in computer graphics the geometry engine was the first verylargescale integration vlsi implementation of a geometry pipeline specialized hardware that accelerated the innerloop geometric computations needed to display threedimensional images for much of its history the company focused on d imaging and were a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market they reincorporated as a delaware corporation in january  through the mid to lates the rapidly improving performance of commodity wintel machines began to erode sgis stronghold in the d market the porting of maya to other platforms is a major event in this process sgi made several attempts to address this including a disastrous move from their existing mips platforms to the intel itanium as well as introducing their own linuxbased intel ia based workstations and servers that failed in the market in the mids the company repositioned itself as a supercomputer vendor a move that also failed on april   sgi filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to

clusters of linux and bsdbased pcs to take on many of the tasks of larger sgi servers ate into sgis core markets the porting of maya to linux mac os x and microsoft windows further eroded the low end of sgis product line in response to challenges faced in the marketplace and a falling share price ed mccracken was fired and sgi brought in richard belluzzo to replace him under belluzzos leadership a number of initiatives were taken which are considered to have accelerated the corporate decline one such initiative was trying to sell workstations running windows nt called visual workstations instead of just ones which ran irix the companys version of unix this put the company in even more direct competition with the likes of dell making it more difficult to justify a price premium the product line was unsuccessful and abandoned a few years later sgis premature announcement of its migration from mips to itanium and its abortive ventures into ia architecture systems the visual workstation line the exintergraph zx range and the sgi series linux servers damaged sgis credibility in the market in  in an attempt to clarify their current market position as more than a graphics company silicon graphics inc changed its corporate identity to sgi although its legal name was unchanged at the same time sgi announced a new logo consisting of only the letters sgi in a proprietary font called sgi created by branding and design consulting firm landor associates in collaboration with designer joe stitzlein the new logo drew criticism for wasting the professional goodwill associated with the previous cube logo or bugcitation needed sgi continued to use the silicon graphics name for its workstation product line and later readopted the cube logo for some workstation models in november  sgi announced that it had been delisted from the new york stock exchange because its common stock had fallen below the minimum share price for listing on the exchange sgis market capitalization dwindled from a peak of over seven billion dollars in  to just  million at the time of delisting in february  sgi noted that it could run out of cash by the end of the year reemergenceedit in mid sgi hired alix partners to advise it on returning to profitability and received a new line of credit sgi announced it was postponing its scheduled annual december stockholders meeting until march  it proposed a reverse stock split to deal with the delisting from the new york stock exchange in january  sgi hired dennis mckenna as its new ceo and chairman of the board of directors mr mckenna succeeded robert bishop who remained vice chairman of the board of directors on may   sgi announced that it had filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection for itself and us subsidiaries as part of a plan to reduce debt by  million two days later the us bankruptcy court approved its first day motions and its use of a  million financing facility provided by a group of its bondholders foreign subsidiaries were unaffected on september   sgi announced the end of development for the mipsirix line and the irix operating system production would end on  december and the last orders would be fulfilled by march  support for these products would end after december  sgi emerged from bankruptcy protection on october   its stock symbol at that point sgidpk was canceled and new stock was issued on the nasdaq exchange under the symbol sgic this new stock was distributed to the companys creditors and the sgid common stockholders were left with worthless shares at the end of that year the company moved its headquarters from mountain view to sunnyvale its earlier north shoreline headquarters is now occupied by the computer history museum the newer amphitheater parkway headquarters was sold to google both of these locations were awardwinning designs by studios architecturecitation needed in april  sgi reentered the visualization market with the sgi virtu range of visualization servers and workstations which were rebadged systems from boxx technologies based on intel xeon or amd opteron processors and nvidia quadro graphics chipsets running red hat enterprise linux suse linux enterprise server or windows compute cluster server final bankruptcy and acquisition by rackable systemsedit in december  sgi received a delisting notification from nasdaq as its market value had been below the minimum  million requirement for  consecutive trading days and also did not meet nasdaqs alternative requirements of a minimum stockholders equity of  million or annual net income from continuing operations of  or more on april   sgi filed for chapter  again and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to rackable systems for  million the sale ultimately for  million was finalized on may   at the same time rackable announced their adoption of silicon graphics international as their global name and brand the bankruptcy court scheduled continuing proceedings and hearings for june  and   and july  needs update after the rackable acquisition vizworld magazine published a series of six articles that chronicle the downfall of sgi graphics properties holdings inc eraedit during the silicon graphics incs second bankruptcy phase it was renamed to graphics properties holdings incgphi in june  in  gphi announced it had won a

over the validity of us patent   and silicon graphics incs voluntary dismissal of the us patent   patent from the lawsuit the federal circuit upheld the jury verdict on the validity of gphis us patent no  and furthermore found that amd had lost its right to challenge patent validity in future proceedings on january   the district court entered an order that permits amd to pursue its invalidity affirmative defense at trial and does not permit sgi to accuse amds radeon r series of graphics products of infringement in this case on april   gphi and amd had entered into a confidential settlement

starting with the iris integrated raster imaging system  series of highperformance graphics terminals were based on the motorola  family of microprocessors the later iris  and  models developed into full unix workstations iris  seriesedit the first entries in the  series models  and  introduced in  were graphics terminals peripherals to be connected to a generalpurpose computer such as a digital equipment corporation vax to provide graphical raster display abilities they used  mhz motorola  cpus with  kb of ram and had no disk drives they booted over the network via an excelan exos ethernet card from their controlling computer they used the pm cpu board which was a variant of the board that was used in stanford universitys sun workstation and later in the sun workstation from sun microsystems the graphics system was composed of the gf frame buffer the uc update controller dc display controller and the bp bitplane the series machines were designed around the multibus standard later series machines the  and  ran at  mhz and had  mb of ram the  had a  mb st disk drive while the  had a  mb smdbased disk drive with a xylogics  disk controller they may have used the pm cpu and pmm ram board from the  series the usual monitor for the  series ran at  hz interlaced six betatest units of the  workstation were produced and the first production unit sgis first commercial computer was shipped to carnegiemellon universitys electronic imaging laboratory in  iris  and  seriesedit geometry engine chip from an iris  sgi rapidly developed its machines into workstations with its second product line — the iris  series first released in august  sgi began using the unix system v operating system there were five models in two product ranges the  range which used  cpus the pm cpu module and the later turbo systems the t t and t which had s the ip cpu module all used the excelan exos ethernet card the same graphics hardware gf frame buffer uc update controller dc display controller bp bitplane their main differences were the cpu ram and weitek floating point accelerator boards disk controllers and disk drives both st and smd were available these could be upgraded for example from a  to a t the  and t had a larger chassis a standard   eia rack with space at the bottom for two smd disk drives weighing approximately  kg each the nonturbo models used the multibus for the cpu to communicate with the floating point accelerator while the turbos added a ribbon cable dedicated for this  hz monitors were used for the  series the height of the machines using motorola cpus was reached with the iris  series models  and  the s both being fullsize rack machines they used the same graphics subsystem and ethernet as the s but could also use up to  geometry engines the first widespread use of hardware graphics accelerators the standard monitor was a   hz noninterlaced unit with a tiltswivel base   hz interlaced and a   hz noninterlaced with tiltswivel base were also available the iris  and its smaller siblings were impressive for the time being complete unix workstations the  was powerful enough to support a complete d animation and rendering package without mainframe support with large capacity hard drives by standards of the day two  mb drives streaming tape and ethernet it could be the centerpiece of an animation operation the line was formally discontinued in november  with about  systems shipped of all  and  models combined risc eraedit with the introduction of the iris d series sgi switched to mips microprocessors these machines were more powerful and came with powerful onboard floatingpoint capability as d graphics became more popular in television and film during this time these systems were responsible for establishing much of sgis reputation sgi produced a broad range of mipsbased workstations and servers during the s running sgis version of unix system v now called irix these included the massive onyx visualization systems the size of refrigerators and capable of supporting up to  processors while managing up to three streams of high resolution fully realized d graphics in october  mips announced the first commercially available bit microprocessor the r sgi used the r in its crimson workstation irix  was the first fully bit irix release including bit pointers to secure the supply of future generations of mips microprocessors the bit r sgi acquired the company in  for  million and renamed it as mips technologies inc a wholly owned subsidiary of sgi in  silicon graphics sgi signed a deal with nintendo to develop the cpu used in the nintendo  a derivative of the ri microprocessor though the deal was signed in early  it was not made public until august of that year and the console itself would not be released until  in  relinquished mips technologies inc in a reipo in the late s when much of the industry expected the itanium to replace both cisc and risc architectures in nonembedded computers sgi announced their intent to phase out mips in their systems development of new mips microprocessors stopped and the existing r design was extended multiple times until  to provide existing customers more time to migrate to itanium in august  sgi announced the end of production for mipsirix systems and by the end of the year mipsirix products were no longer generally available from sgi iris gl and opengledit until the second generation onyx reality engine machines sgi offered access to its high performance d graphics subsystems through a proprietary api known as iris graphics language iris gl as more features were added over the years iris gl became harder to maintain and more cumbersome to use in  sgi decided to clean up and reform iris gl and made the bold move of allowing the resulting opengl api to be cheaply licensed by sgis competitors and set up an industrywide consortium to maintain the opengl standard the opengl architecture review board this meant that for the first time fast

nominated for an academy award for distinguished achievement in visual effects were created on silicon graphics computer systems once inexpensive pcs began to have graphics performance close to the more expensive specialized graphical workstations which were sgis core business sgi shifted its focus to high performance servers for digital video and the web many sgi graphics engineers left to work

purchased alias research and wavefront technologies in a deal totaling approximately  million and merged the companies into aliaswavefront in june  sgi sold the business later renamed to alias systems corporation to the private equity investment firm accelkkr for  million in october  autodesk announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire alias for  million in cash in february  sgi purchased the wellknown supercomputer manufacturer cray research for  million and began to use marketing names such as craylink for sgideveloped technology integrated into the sgi server line three months later it sold crays business systems division responsible for the cs sparcsolaris server to sun microsystems for an undisclosed amount widely believed to be  million many of the cray te engineers designed and developed the sgi altix and numalink technology sgi sold the cray brand and product lines to tera computer company on march   for  million plus one million shares sgi also distributed its remaining interest in mips technologies through a spinoff effective june   in september  sgi acquired the zx series of windows workstations and servers from intergraph computer systems

workstations running windows nt or red hat linux see also sgi visual workstation proved to be a financial disaster and shook customer confidence in sgi’s commitment to its own mipsbased line switch to itaniumedit in  sgi announced that future generations of its machines would be based not on their own mips processors but the upcoming superchip from intel codenamed merced and later called itanium funding for its own highend processors was reduced and it was planned that the r would be the last mips mainstream processor mips technologies would focus entirely on the embedded market where it was having some success and sgi would no longer have to fund development of a cpu that since the failure of arc found use only in their own machines this plan quickly went awry as early as  it was clear the itanium was going to be delivered very late and would have nowhere near the performance originally expected as the production delays increased mips existing rbased machines grew increasingly uncompetitive eventually it was forced to introduce faster mips processors the r r and r which were used in a series of models from  through  sgis first itaniumbased system was the shortlived sgi  workstation launched in  sgis mipsbased systems were not to be superseded until the launch of the itanium based altix servers and prism workstations some time later unlike the mips systems which ran irix the itanium systems used suse linux enterprise server with sgi enhancements as their operating system sgi used transitive corporations quicktransit software to allow their old mipsirix applications to run in emulation on the new itaniumlinux platform in the server market the itanium based altix eventually replaced the mipsbased origin product line in the workstation market the switch to itanium was not completed before sgi exited the market the altix was the most powerful computer in the world in  assuming that a computer is defined as a collection of hardware running under a single instance of an operating system the altix had  itanium processors running under a single instance of linux a cluster of  machines was then the eighthfastest supercomputer all faster supercomputers were clusters but none have as many flops per machine however more recent supercomputers are very large clusters of machines that are individually less capable sgi acknowledged this and in  moved away from the massive numa model to clusters switch to xeonedit although sgi continued to market itaniumbased machines its more recent machines were based on the intel xeon processor the first altix xe systems were relatively lowend machines but by december  the xe systems were more capable than the itanium machines by some measures eg power consumption in flopsw density in flopsm costflops the xe and xe servers used a cluster architecture this was a departure from the pure numa architectures of the earlier itanium and mips servers in june  sgi announced the altix ice  a

government and defense applications energy and scientific and technical computing the rise of cheap yet powerful commodity workstations running linux windows and mac os x and the availability of diverse professional software for them effectively pushed sgi out of the visual effects industry in all but the most niche markets highend server marketedit sgi continued to enhance its line of servers including some supercomputers based on the sn architecture sn for scalable node is a technology developed by sgi in the mids that uses cachecoherent nonuniform memory access ccnuma in an sn system processors memory and a bus and memorycontroller are coupled together into an entity called a node usually on a single circuit board nodes are connected by a highspeed interconnect called numalink originally marketed as craylink there is no internal bus and instead access between processors memory and io devices is done through a switched fabric of links and routers thanks to the cache coherence of the distributed shared memory sn systems scale along several axes at once as cpu count increases so does memory capacity io capacity and system bisection bandwidth this allows the combined memory of all the nodes to be accessed under a single os image using standard sharedmemory synchronization methods this makes an sn system far easier to program and able to achieve higher sustainedtopeak performance than noncachecoherent systems like conventional clusters or massively parallel computers which require applications code to be written or rewritten to do explicit messagepassing communication between their nodes the first sn system known as sn was released in  under the product name origin  based on the mips r processor it scaled from  to  processors and a smaller version the origin  sn scaled from  to  later enhancements enabled systems of as large as  processors the second generation system originally called sn but later snmips was released in july  as the origin  it scaled from  to  processors and processor configurations were delivered by special order to some customers a smaller less scalable implementation followed called origin  in november  sgi announced a repackaging of its sn system under the name origin  it quadrupled the processor area density of the snmips system from  up to  processors per rack while moving to a fat tree interconnect topology in january  sgi announced a variant of the sn platform called the altix  internally called snia it used intel itanium  processors and ran the linux operating system kernel at the time it was released it was the worlds most scalable linuxbased computer supporting up to  processors in a single system node nodes could be connected using the same numalink technology to form what sgi predictably termed superclusters in february  sgi announced general support for  processor nodes to be followed by  and  processor versions that year in april  sgi announced the sale of its alias

clark kurt akeley ed mccracken thomas jermoluk products highperformance computing visualization and storage website wwwsgicom silicon graphics inc later rebranded sgi historically known as silicon graphics computer systems or sgcs was an american highperformance computing manufacturer producing computer hardware and software founded in mountain view california in november  by jim clark its initial market was d graphics computer workstations but its products strategies and market positions developed significantly over time early systems were based on the geometry engine that clark and marc hannah had developed at stanford university and were derived from clarks broader background in computer graphics the geometry engine was the first verylargescale integration vlsi implementation of a geometry pipeline specialized hardware that accelerated the innerloop geometric computations needed to display threedimensional images for much of its history the company focused on d imaging and were a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market they reincorporated as a delaware corporation in january  through the mid to lates the rapidly improving performance of commodity wintel machines began to erode sgis stronghold in the d market the porting of maya to other platforms is a major event in this process sgi made several attempts to address this including a disastrous move from their existing mips platforms to the intel itanium as well as introducing their own linuxbased intel ia based workstations and servers that failed in the market in the mids the company repositioned itself as a supercomputer vendor a move that also failed on april   sgi filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to

clusters of linux and bsdbased pcs to take on many of the tasks of larger sgi servers ate into sgis core markets the porting of maya to linux mac os x and microsoft windows further eroded the low end of sgis product line in response to challenges faced in the marketplace and a falling share price ed mccracken was fired and sgi brought in richard belluzzo to replace him under belluzzos leadership a number of initiatives were taken which are considered to have accelerated the corporate decline one such initiative was trying to sell workstations running windows nt called visual workstations instead of just ones which ran irix the companys version of unix this put the company in even more direct competition with the likes of dell making it more difficult to justify a price premium the product line was unsuccessful and abandoned a few years later sgis premature announcement of its migration from mips to itanium and its abortive ventures into ia architecture systems the visual workstation line the exintergraph zx range and the sgi series linux servers damaged sgis credibility in the market in  in an attempt to clarify their current market position as more than a graphics company silicon graphics inc changed its corporate identity to sgi although its legal name was unchanged at the same time sgi announced a new logo consisting of only the letters sgi in a proprietary font called sgi created by branding and design consulting firm landor associates in collaboration with designer joe stitzlein the new logo drew criticism for wasting the professional goodwill associated with the previous cube logo or bugcitation needed sgi continued to use the silicon graphics name for its workstation product line and later readopted the cube logo for some workstation models in november  sgi announced that it had been delisted from the new york stock exchange because its common stock had fallen below the minimum share price for listing on the exchange sgis market capitalization dwindled from a peak of over seven billion dollars in  to just  million at the time of delisting in february  sgi noted that it could run out of cash by the end of the year reemergenceedit in mid sgi hired alix partners to advise it on returning to profitability and received a new line of credit sgi announced it was postponing its scheduled annual december stockholders meeting until march  it proposed a reverse stock split to deal with the delisting from the new york stock exchange in january  sgi hired dennis mckenna as its new ceo and chairman of the board of directors mr mckenna succeeded robert bishop who remained vice chairman of the board of directors on may   sgi announced that it had filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection for itself and us subsidiaries as part of a plan to reduce debt by  million two days later the us bankruptcy court approved its first day motions and its use of a  million financing facility provided by a group of its bondholders foreign subsidiaries were unaffected on september   sgi announced the end of development for the mipsirix line and the irix operating system production would end on  december and the last orders would be fulfilled by march  support for these products would end after december  sgi emerged from bankruptcy protection on october   its stock symbol at that point sgidpk was canceled and new stock was issued on the nasdaq exchange under the symbol sgic this new stock was distributed to the companys creditors and the sgid common stockholders were left with worthless shares at the end of that year the company moved its headquarters from mountain view to sunnyvale its earlier north shoreline headquarters is now occupied by the computer history museum the newer amphitheater parkway headquarters was sold to google both of these locations were awardwinning designs by studios architecturecitation needed in april  sgi reentered the visualization market with the sgi virtu range of visualization servers and workstations which were rebadged systems from boxx technologies based on intel xeon or amd opteron processors and nvidia quadro graphics chipsets running red hat enterprise linux suse linux enterprise server or windows compute cluster server final bankruptcy and acquisition by rackable systemsedit in december  sgi received a delisting notification from nasdaq as its market value had been below the minimum  million requirement for  consecutive trading days and also did not meet nasdaqs alternative requirements of a minimum stockholders equity of  million or annual net income from continuing operations of  or more on april   sgi filed for chapter  again and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to rackable systems for  million the sale ultimately for  million was finalized on may   at the same time rackable announced their adoption of silicon graphics international as their global name and brand the bankruptcy court scheduled continuing proceedings and hearings for june  and   and july  needs update after the rackable acquisition vizworld magazine published a series of six articles that chronicle the downfall of sgi graphics properties holdings inc eraedit during the silicon graphics incs second bankruptcy phase it was renamed to graphics properties holdings incgphi in june  in  gphi announced it had won a

over the validity of us patent   and silicon graphics incs voluntary dismissal of the us patent   patent from the lawsuit the federal circuit upheld the jury verdict on the validity of gphis us patent no  and furthermore found that amd had lost its right to challenge patent validity in future proceedings on january   the district court entered an order that permits amd to pursue its invalidity affirmative defense at trial and does not permit sgi to accuse amds radeon r series of graphics products of infringement in this case on april   gphi and amd had entered into a confidential settlement

starting with the iris integrated raster imaging system  series of highperformance graphics terminals were based on the motorola  family of microprocessors the later iris  and  models developed into full unix workstations iris  seriesedit the first entries in the  series models  and  introduced in  were graphics terminals peripherals to be connected to a generalpurpose computer such as a digital equipment corporation vax to provide graphical raster display abilities they used  mhz motorola  cpus with  kb of ram and had no disk drives they booted over the network via an excelan exos ethernet card from their controlling computer they used the pm cpu board which was a variant of the board that was used in stanford universitys sun workstation and later in the sun workstation from sun microsystems the graphics system was composed of the gf frame buffer the uc update controller dc display controller and the bp bitplane the series machines were designed around the multibus standard later series machines the  and  ran at  mhz and had  mb of ram the  had a  mb st disk drive while the  had a  mb smdbased disk drive with a xylogics  disk controller they may have used the pm cpu and pmm ram board from the  series the usual monitor for the  series ran at  hz interlaced six betatest units of the  workstation were produced and the first production unit sgis first commercial computer was shipped to carnegiemellon universitys electronic imaging laboratory in  iris  and  seriesedit geometry engine chip from an iris  sgi rapidly developed its machines into workstations with its second product line — the iris  series first released in august  sgi began using the unix system v operating system there were five models in two product ranges the  range which used  cpus the pm cpu module and the later turbo systems the t t and t which had s the ip cpu module all used the excelan exos ethernet card the same graphics hardware gf frame buffer uc update controller dc display controller bp bitplane their main differences were the cpu ram and weitek floating point accelerator boards disk controllers and disk drives both st and smd were available these could be upgraded for example from a  to a t the  and t had a larger chassis a standard   eia rack with space at the bottom for two smd disk drives weighing approximately  kg each the nonturbo models used the multibus for the cpu to communicate with the floating point accelerator while the turbos added a ribbon cable dedicated for this  hz monitors were used for the  series the height of the machines using motorola cpus was reached with the iris  series models  and  the s both being fullsize rack machines they used the same graphics subsystem and ethernet as the s but could also use up to  geometry engines the first widespread use of hardware graphics accelerators the standard monitor was a   hz noninterlaced unit with a tiltswivel base   hz interlaced and a   hz noninterlaced with tiltswivel base were also available the iris  and its smaller siblings were impressive for the time being complete unix workstations the  was powerful enough to support a complete d animation and rendering package without mainframe support with large capacity hard drives by standards of the day two  mb drives streaming tape and ethernet it could be the centerpiece of an animation operation the line was formally discontinued in november  with about  systems shipped of all  and  models combined risc eraedit with the introduction of the iris d series sgi switched to mips microprocessors these machines were more powerful and came with powerful onboard floatingpoint capability as d graphics became more popular in television and film during this time these systems were responsible for establishing much of sgis reputation sgi produced a broad range of mipsbased workstations and servers during the s running sgis version of unix system v now called irix these included the massive onyx visualization systems the size of refrigerators and capable of supporting up to  processors while managing up to three streams of high resolution fully realized d graphics in october  mips announced the first commercially available bit microprocessor the r sgi used the r in its crimson workstation irix  was the first fully bit irix release including bit pointers to secure the supply of future generations of mips microprocessors the bit r sgi acquired the company in  for  million and renamed it as mips technologies inc a wholly owned subsidiary of sgi in  silicon graphics sgi signed a deal with nintendo to develop the cpu used in the nintendo  a derivative of the ri microprocessor though the deal was signed in early  it was not made public until august of that year and the console itself would not be released until  in  relinquished mips technologies inc in a reipo in the late s when much of the industry expected the itanium to replace both cisc and risc architectures in nonembedded computers sgi announced their intent to phase out mips in their systems development of new mips microprocessors stopped and the existing r design was extended multiple times until  to provide existing customers more time to migrate to itanium in august  sgi announced the end of production for mipsirix systems and by the end of the year mipsirix products were no longer generally available from sgi iris gl and opengledit until the second generation onyx reality engine machines sgi offered access to its high performance d graphics subsystems through a proprietary api known as iris graphics language iris gl as more features were added over the years iris gl became harder to maintain and more cumbersome to use in  sgi decided to clean up and reform iris gl and made the bold move of allowing the resulting opengl api to be cheaply licensed by sgis competitors and set up an industrywide consortium to maintain the opengl standard the opengl architecture review board this meant that for the first time fast

nominated for an academy award for distinguished achievement in visual effects were created on silicon graphics computer systems once inexpensive pcs began to have graphics performance close to the more expensive specialized graphical workstations which were sgis core business sgi shifted its focus to high performance servers for digital video and the web many sgi graphics engineers left to work

purchased alias research and wavefront technologies in a deal totaling approximately  million and merged the companies into aliaswavefront in june  sgi sold the business later renamed to alias systems corporation to the private equity investment firm accelkkr for  million in october  autodesk announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire alias for  million in cash in february  sgi purchased the wellknown supercomputer manufacturer cray research for  million and began to use marketing names such as craylink for sgideveloped technology integrated into the sgi server line three months later it sold crays business systems division responsible for the cs sparcsolaris server to sun microsystems for an undisclosed amount widely believed to be  million many of the cray te engineers designed and developed the sgi altix and numalink technology sgi sold the cray brand and product lines to tera computer company on march   for  million plus one million shares sgi also distributed its remaining interest in mips technologies through a spinoff effective june   in september  sgi acquired the zx series of windows workstations and servers from intergraph computer systems

workstations running windows nt or red hat linux see also sgi visual workstation proved to be a financial disaster and shook customer confidence in sgi’s commitment to its own mipsbased line switch to itaniumedit in  sgi announced that future generations of its machines would be based not on their own mips processors but the upcoming superchip from intel codenamed merced and later called itanium funding for its own highend processors was reduced and it was planned that the r would be the last mips mainstream processor mips technologies would focus entirely on the embedded market where it was having some success and sgi would no longer have to fund development of a cpu that since the failure of arc found use only in their own machines this plan quickly went awry as early as  it was clear the itanium was going to be delivered very late and would have nowhere near the performance originally expected as the production delays increased mips existing rbased machines grew increasingly uncompetitive eventually it was forced to introduce faster mips processors the r r and r which were used in a series of models from  through  sgis first itaniumbased system was the shortlived sgi  workstation launched in  sgis mipsbased systems were not to be superseded until the launch of the itanium based altix servers and prism workstations some time later unlike the mips systems which ran irix the itanium systems used suse linux enterprise server with sgi enhancements as their operating system sgi used transitive corporations quicktransit software to allow their old mipsirix applications to run in emulation on the new itaniumlinux platform in the server market the itanium based altix eventually replaced the mipsbased origin product line in the workstation market the switch to itanium was not completed before sgi exited the market the altix was the most powerful computer in the world in  assuming that a computer is defined as a collection of hardware running under a single instance of an operating system the altix had  itanium processors running under a single instance of linux a cluster of  machines was then the eighthfastest supercomputer all faster supercomputers were clusters but none have as many flops per machine however more recent supercomputers are very large clusters of machines that are individually less capable sgi acknowledged this and in  moved away from the massive numa model to clusters switch to xeonedit although sgi continued to market itaniumbased machines its more recent machines were based on the intel xeon processor the first altix xe systems were relatively lowend machines but by december  the xe systems were more capable than the itanium machines by some measures eg power consumption in flopsw density in flopsm costflops the xe and xe servers used a cluster architecture this was a departure from the pure numa architectures of the earlier itanium and mips servers in june  sgi announced the altix ice  a

government and defense applications energy and scientific and technical computing the rise of cheap yet powerful commodity workstations running linux windows and mac os x and the availability of diverse professional software for them effectively pushed sgi out of the visual effects industry in all but the most niche markets highend server marketedit sgi continued to enhance its line of servers including some supercomputers based on the sn architecture sn for scalable node is a technology developed by sgi in the mids that uses cachecoherent nonuniform memory access ccnuma in an sn system processors memory and a bus and memorycontroller are coupled together into an entity called a node usually on a single circuit board nodes are connected by a highspeed interconnect called numalink originally marketed as craylink there is no internal bus and instead access between processors memory and io devices is done through a switched fabric of links and routers thanks to the cache coherence of the distributed shared memory sn systems scale along several axes at once as cpu count increases so does memory capacity io capacity and system bisection bandwidth this allows the combined memory of all the nodes to be accessed under a single os image using standard sharedmemory synchronization methods this makes an sn system far easier to program and able to achieve higher sustainedtopeak performance than noncachecoherent systems like conventional clusters or massively parallel computers which require applications code to be written or rewritten to do explicit messagepassing communication between their nodes the first sn system known as sn was released in  under the product name origin  based on the mips r processor it scaled from  to  processors and a smaller version the origin  sn scaled from  to  later enhancements enabled systems of as large as  processors the second generation system originally called sn but later snmips was released in july  as the origin  it scaled from  to  processors and processor configurations were delivered by special order to some customers a smaller less scalable implementation followed called origin  in november  sgi announced a repackaging of its sn system under the name origin  it quadrupled the processor area density of the snmips system from  up to  processors per rack while moving to a fat tree interconnect topology in january  sgi announced a variant of the sn platform called the altix  internally called snia it used intel itanium  processors and ran the linux operating system kernel at the time it was released it was the worlds most scalable linuxbased computer supporting up to  processors in a single system node nodes could be connected using the same numalink technology to form what sgi predictably termed superclusters in february  sgi announced general support for  processor nodes to be followed by  and  processor versions that year in april  sgi announced the sale of its alias

clark kurt akeley ed mccracken thomas jermoluk products highperformance computing visualization and storage website wwwsgicom silicon graphics inc later rebranded sgi historically known as silicon graphics computer systems or sgcs was an american highperformance computing manufacturer producing computer hardware and software founded in mountain view california in november  by jim clark its initial market was d graphics computer workstations but its products strategies and market positions developed significantly over time early systems were based on the geometry engine that clark and marc hannah had developed at stanford university and were derived from clarks broader background in computer graphics the geometry engine was the first verylargescale integration vlsi implementation of a geometry pipeline specialized hardware that accelerated the innerloop geometric computations needed to display threedimensional images for much of its history the company focused on d imaging and were a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market they reincorporated as a delaware corporation in january  through the mid to lates the rapidly improving performance of commodity wintel machines began to erode sgis stronghold in the d market the porting of maya to other platforms is a major event in this process sgi made several attempts to address this including a disastrous move from their existing mips platforms to the intel itanium as well as introducing their own linuxbased intel ia based workstations and servers that failed in the market in the mids the company repositioned itself as a supercomputer vendor a move that also failed on april   sgi filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to

clusters of linux and bsdbased pcs to take on many of the tasks of larger sgi servers ate into sgis core markets the porting of maya to linux mac os x and microsoft windows further eroded the low end of sgis product line in response to challenges faced in the marketplace and a falling share price ed mccracken was fired and sgi brought in richard belluzzo to replace him under belluzzos leadership a number of initiatives were taken which are considered to have accelerated the corporate decline one such initiative was trying to sell workstations running windows nt called visual workstations instead of just ones which ran irix the companys version of unix this put the company in even more direct competition with the likes of dell making it more difficult to justify a price premium the product line was unsuccessful and abandoned a few years later sgis premature announcement of its migration from mips to itanium and its abortive ventures into ia architecture systems the visual workstation line the exintergraph zx range and the sgi series linux servers damaged sgis credibility in the market in  in an attempt to clarify their current market position as more than a graphics company silicon graphics inc changed its corporate identity to sgi although its legal name was unchanged at the same time sgi announced a new logo consisting of only the letters sgi in a proprietary font called sgi created by branding and design consulting firm landor associates in collaboration with designer joe stitzlein the new logo drew criticism for wasting the professional goodwill associated with the previous cube logo or bugcitation needed sgi continued to use the silicon graphics name for its workstation product line and later readopted the cube logo for some workstation models in november  sgi announced that it had been delisted from the new york stock exchange because its common stock had fallen below the minimum share price for listing on the exchange sgis market capitalization dwindled from a peak of over seven billion dollars in  to just  million at the time of delisting in february  sgi noted that it could run out of cash by the end of the year reemergenceedit in mid sgi hired alix partners to advise it on returning to profitability and received a new line of credit sgi announced it was postponing its scheduled annual december stockholders meeting until march  it proposed a reverse stock split to deal with the delisting from the new york stock exchange in january  sgi hired dennis mckenna as its new ceo and chairman of the board of directors mr mckenna succeeded robert bishop who remained vice chairman of the board of directors on may   sgi announced that it had filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection for itself and us subsidiaries as part of a plan to reduce debt by  million two days later the us bankruptcy court approved its first day motions and its use of a  million financing facility provided by a group of its bondholders foreign subsidiaries were unaffected on september   sgi announced the end of development for the mipsirix line and the irix operating system production would end on  december and the last orders would be fulfilled by march  support for these products would end after december  sgi emerged from bankruptcy protection on october   its stock symbol at that point sgidpk was canceled and new stock was issued on the nasdaq exchange under the symbol sgic this new stock was distributed to the companys creditors and the sgid common stockholders were left with worthless shares at the end of that year the company moved its headquarters from mountain view to sunnyvale its earlier north shoreline headquarters is now occupied by the computer history museum the newer amphitheater parkway headquarters was sold to google both of these locations were awardwinning designs by studios architecturecitation needed in april  sgi reentered the visualization market with the sgi virtu range of visualization servers and workstations which were rebadged systems from boxx technologies based on intel xeon or amd opteron processors and nvidia quadro graphics chipsets running red hat enterprise linux suse linux enterprise server or windows compute cluster server final bankruptcy and acquisition by rackable systemsedit in december  sgi received a delisting notification from nasdaq as its market value had been below the minimum  million requirement for  consecutive trading days and also did not meet nasdaqs alternative requirements of a minimum stockholders equity of  million or annual net income from continuing operations of  or more on april   sgi filed for chapter  again and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to rackable systems for  million the sale ultimately for  million was finalized on may   at the same time rackable announced their adoption of silicon graphics international as their global name and brand the bankruptcy court scheduled continuing proceedings and hearings for june  and   and july  needs update after the rackable acquisition vizworld magazine published a series of six articles that chronicle the downfall of sgi graphics properties holdings inc eraedit during the silicon graphics incs second bankruptcy phase it was renamed to graphics properties holdings incgphi in june  in  gphi announced it had won a

over the validity of us patent   and silicon graphics incs voluntary dismissal of the us patent   patent from the lawsuit the federal circuit upheld the jury verdict on the validity of gphis us patent no  and furthermore found that amd had lost its right to challenge patent validity in future proceedings on january   the district court entered an order that permits amd to pursue its invalidity affirmative defense at trial and does not permit sgi to accuse amds radeon r series of graphics products of infringement in this case on april   gphi and amd had entered into a confidential settlement

starting with the iris integrated raster imaging system  series of highperformance graphics terminals were based on the motorola  family of microprocessors the later iris  and  models developed into full unix workstations iris  seriesedit the first entries in the  series models  and  introduced in  were graphics terminals peripherals to be connected to a generalpurpose computer such as a digital equipment corporation vax to provide graphical raster display abilities they used  mhz motorola  cpus with  kb of ram and had no disk drives they booted over the network via an excelan exos ethernet card from their controlling computer they used the pm cpu board which was a variant of the board that was used in stanford universitys sun workstation and later in the sun workstation from sun microsystems the graphics system was composed of the gf frame buffer the uc update controller dc display controller and the bp bitplane the series machines were designed around the multibus standard later series machines the  and  ran at  mhz and had  mb of ram the  had a  mb st disk drive while the  had a  mb smdbased disk drive with a xylogics  disk controller they may have used the pm cpu and pmm ram board from the  series the usual monitor for the  series ran at  hz interlaced six betatest units of the  workstation were produced and the first production unit sgis first commercial computer was shipped to carnegiemellon universitys electronic imaging laboratory in  iris  and  seriesedit geometry engine chip from an iris  sgi rapidly developed its machines into workstations with its second product line — the iris  series first released in august  sgi began using the unix system v operating system there were five models in two product ranges the  range which used  cpus the pm cpu module and the later turbo systems the t t and t which had s the ip cpu module all used the excelan exos ethernet card the same graphics hardware gf frame buffer uc update controller dc display controller bp bitplane their main differences were the cpu ram and weitek floating point accelerator boards disk controllers and disk drives both st and smd were available these could be upgraded for example from a  to a t the  and t had a larger chassis a standard   eia rack with space at the bottom for two smd disk drives weighing approximately  kg each the nonturbo models used the multibus for the cpu to communicate with the floating point accelerator while the turbos added a ribbon cable dedicated for this  hz monitors were used for the  series the height of the machines using motorola cpus was reached with the iris  series models  and  the s both being fullsize rack machines they used the same graphics subsystem and ethernet as the s but could also use up to  geometry engines the first widespread use of hardware graphics accelerators the standard monitor was a   hz noninterlaced unit with a tiltswivel base   hz interlaced and a   hz noninterlaced with tiltswivel base were also available the iris  and its smaller siblings were impressive for the time being complete unix workstations the  was powerful enough to support a complete d animation and rendering package without mainframe support with large capacity hard drives by standards of the day two  mb drives streaming tape and ethernet it could be the centerpiece of an animation operation the line was formally discontinued in november  with about  systems shipped of all  and  models combined risc eraedit with the introduction of the iris d series sgi switched to mips microprocessors these machines were more powerful and came with powerful onboard floatingpoint capability as d graphics became more popular in television and film during this time these systems were responsible for establishing much of sgis reputation sgi produced a broad range of mipsbased workstations and servers during the s running sgis version of unix system v now called irix these included the massive onyx visualization systems the size of refrigerators and capable of supporting up to  processors while managing up to three streams of high resolution fully realized d graphics in october  mips announced the first commercially available bit microprocessor the r sgi used the r in its crimson workstation irix  was the first fully bit irix release including bit pointers to secure the supply of future generations of mips microprocessors the bit r sgi acquired the company in  for  million and renamed it as mips technologies inc a wholly owned subsidiary of sgi in  silicon graphics sgi signed a deal with nintendo to develop the cpu used in the nintendo  a derivative of the ri microprocessor though the deal was signed in early  it was not made public until august of that year and the console itself would not be released until  in  relinquished mips technologies inc in a reipo in the late s when much of the industry expected the itanium to replace both cisc and risc architectures in nonembedded computers sgi announced their intent to phase out mips in their systems development of new mips microprocessors stopped and the existing r design was extended multiple times until  to provide existing customers more time to migrate to itanium in august  sgi announced the end of production for mipsirix systems and by the end of the year mipsirix products were no longer generally available from sgi iris gl and opengledit until the second generation onyx reality engine machines sgi offered access to its high performance d graphics subsystems through a proprietary api known as iris graphics language iris gl as more features were added over the years iris gl became harder to maintain and more cumbersome to use in  sgi decided to clean up and reform iris gl and made the bold move of allowing the resulting opengl api to be cheaply licensed by sgis competitors and set up an industrywide consortium to maintain the opengl standard the opengl architecture review board this meant that for the first time fast

nominated for an academy award for distinguished achievement in visual effects were created on silicon graphics computer systems once inexpensive pcs began to have graphics performance close to the more expensive specialized graphical workstations which were sgis core business sgi shifted its focus to high performance servers for digital video and the web many sgi graphics engineers left to work

purchased alias research and wavefront technologies in a deal totaling approximately  million and merged the companies into aliaswavefront in june  sgi sold the business later renamed to alias systems corporation to the private equity investment firm accelkkr for  million in october  autodesk announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire alias for  million in cash in february  sgi purchased the wellknown supercomputer manufacturer cray research for  million and began to use marketing names such as craylink for sgideveloped technology integrated into the sgi server line three months later it sold crays business systems division responsible for the cs sparcsolaris server to sun microsystems for an undisclosed amount widely believed to be  million many of the cray te engineers designed and developed the sgi altix and numalink technology sgi sold the cray brand and product lines to tera computer company on march   for  million plus one million shares sgi also distributed its remaining interest in mips technologies through a spinoff effective june   in september  sgi acquired the zx series of windows workstations and servers from intergraph computer systems

workstations running windows nt or red hat linux see also sgi visual workstation proved to be a financial disaster and shook customer confidence in sgi’s commitment to its own mipsbased line switch to itaniumedit in  sgi announced that future generations of its machines would be based not on their own mips processors but the upcoming superchip from intel codenamed merced and later called itanium funding for its own highend processors was reduced and it was planned that the r would be the last mips mainstream processor mips technologies would focus entirely on the embedded market where it was having some success and sgi would no longer have to fund development of a cpu that since the failure of arc found use only in their own machines this plan quickly went awry as early as  it was clear the itanium was going to be delivered very late and would have nowhere near the performance originally expected as the production delays increased mips existing rbased machines grew increasingly uncompetitive eventually it was forced to introduce faster mips processors the r r and r which were used in a series of models from  through  sgis first itaniumbased system was the shortlived sgi  workstation launched in  sgis mipsbased systems were not to be superseded until the launch of the itanium based altix servers and prism workstations some time later unlike the mips systems which ran irix the itanium systems used suse linux enterprise server with sgi enhancements as their operating system sgi used transitive corporations quicktransit software to allow their old mipsirix applications to run in emulation on the new itaniumlinux platform in the server market the itanium based altix eventually replaced the mipsbased origin product line in the workstation market the switch to itanium was not completed before sgi exited the market the altix was the most powerful computer in the world in  assuming that a computer is defined as a collection of hardware running under a single instance of an operating system the altix had  itanium processors running under a single instance of linux a cluster of  machines was then the eighthfastest supercomputer all faster supercomputers were clusters but none have as many flops per machine however more recent supercomputers are very large clusters of machines that are individually less capable sgi acknowledged this and in  moved away from the massive numa model to clusters switch to xeonedit although sgi continued to market itaniumbased machines its more recent machines were based on the intel xeon processor the first altix xe systems were relatively lowend machines but by december  the xe systems were more capable than the itanium machines by some measures eg power consumption in flopsw density in flopsm costflops the xe and xe servers used a cluster architecture this was a departure from the pure numa architectures of the earlier itanium and mips servers in june  sgi announced the altix ice  a

government and defense applications energy and scientific and technical computing the rise of cheap yet powerful commodity workstations running linux windows and mac os x and the availability of diverse professional software for them effectively pushed sgi out of the visual effects industry in all but the most niche markets highend server marketedit sgi continued to enhance its line of servers including some supercomputers based on the sn architecture sn for scalable node is a technology developed by sgi in the mids that uses cachecoherent nonuniform memory access ccnuma in an sn system processors memory and a bus and memorycontroller are coupled together into an entity called a node usually on a single circuit board nodes are connected by a highspeed interconnect called numalink originally marketed as craylink there is no internal bus and instead access between processors memory and io devices is done through a switched fabric of links and routers thanks to the cache coherence of the distributed shared memory sn systems scale along several axes at once as cpu count increases so does memory capacity io capacity and system bisection bandwidth this allows the combined memory of all the nodes to be accessed under a single os image using standard sharedmemory synchronization methods this makes an sn system far easier to program and able to achieve higher sustainedtopeak performance than noncachecoherent systems like conventional clusters or massively parallel computers which require applications code to be written or rewritten to do explicit messagepassing communication between their nodes the first sn system known as sn was released in  under the product name origin  based on the mips r processor it scaled from  to  processors and a smaller version the origin  sn scaled from  to  later enhancements enabled systems of as large as  processors the second generation system originally called sn but later snmips was released in july  as the origin  it scaled from  to  processors and processor configurations were delivered by special order to some customers a smaller less scalable implementation followed called origin  in november  sgi announced a repackaging of its sn system under the name origin  it quadrupled the processor area density of the snmips system from  up to  processors per rack while moving to a fat tree interconnect topology in january  sgi announced a variant of the sn platform called the altix  internally called snia it used intel itanium  processors and ran the linux operating system kernel at the time it was released it was the worlds most scalable linuxbased computer supporting up to  processors in a single system node nodes could be connected using the same numalink technology to form what sgi predictably termed superclusters in february  sgi announced general support for  processor nodes to be followed by  and  processor versions that year in april  sgi announced the sale of its alias

clark kurt akeley ed mccracken thomas jermoluk products highperformance computing visualization and storage website wwwsgicom silicon graphics inc later rebranded sgi historically known as silicon graphics computer systems or sgcs was an american highperformance computing manufacturer producing computer hardware and software founded in mountain view california in november  by jim clark its initial market was d graphics computer workstations but its products strategies and market positions developed significantly over time early systems were based on the geometry engine that clark and marc hannah had developed at stanford university and were derived from clarks broader background in computer graphics the geometry engine was the first verylargescale integration vlsi implementation of a geometry pipeline specialized hardware that accelerated the innerloop geometric computations needed to display threedimensional images for much of its history the company focused on d imaging and were a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market they reincorporated as a delaware corporation in january  through the mid to lates the rapidly improving performance of commodity wintel machines began to erode sgis stronghold in the d market the porting of maya to other platforms is a major event in this process sgi made several attempts to address this including a disastrous move from their existing mips platforms to the intel itanium as well as introducing their own linuxbased intel ia based workstations and servers that failed in the market in the mids the company repositioned itself as a supercomputer vendor a move that also failed on april   sgi filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to

clusters of linux and bsdbased pcs to take on many of the tasks of larger sgi servers ate into sgis core markets the porting of maya to linux mac os x and microsoft windows further eroded the low end of sgis product line in response to challenges faced in the marketplace and a falling share price ed mccracken was fired and sgi brought in richard belluzzo to replace him under belluzzos leadership a number of initiatives were taken which are considered to have accelerated the corporate decline one such initiative was trying to sell workstations running windows nt called visual workstations instead of just ones which ran irix the companys version of unix this put the company in even more direct competition with the likes of dell making it more difficult to justify a price premium the product line was unsuccessful and abandoned a few years later sgis premature announcement of its migration from mips to itanium and its abortive ventures into ia architecture systems the visual workstation line the exintergraph zx range and the sgi series linux servers damaged sgis credibility in the market in  in an attempt to clarify their current market position as more than a graphics company silicon graphics inc changed its corporate identity to sgi although its legal name was unchanged at the same time sgi announced a new logo consisting of only the letters sgi in a proprietary font called sgi created by branding and design consulting firm landor associates in collaboration with designer joe stitzlein the new logo drew criticism for wasting the professional goodwill associated with the previous cube logo or bugcitation needed sgi continued to use the silicon graphics name for its workstation product line and later readopted the cube logo for some workstation models in november  sgi announced that it had been delisted from the new york stock exchange because its common stock had fallen below the minimum share price for listing on the exchange sgis market capitalization dwindled from a peak of over seven billion dollars in  to just  million at the time of delisting in february  sgi noted that it could run out of cash by the end of the year reemergenceedit in mid sgi hired alix partners to advise it on returning to profitability and received a new line of credit sgi announced it was postponing its scheduled annual december stockholders meeting until march  it proposed a reverse stock split to deal with the delisting from the new york stock exchange in january  sgi hired dennis mckenna as its new ceo and chairman of the board of directors mr mckenna succeeded robert bishop who remained vice chairman of the board of directors on may   sgi announced that it had filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection for itself and us subsidiaries as part of a plan to reduce debt by  million two days later the us bankruptcy court approved its first day motions and its use of a  million financing facility provided by a group of its bondholders foreign subsidiaries were unaffected on september   sgi announced the end of development for the mipsirix line and the irix operating system production would end on  december and the last orders would be fulfilled by march  support for these products would end after december  sgi emerged from bankruptcy protection on october   its stock symbol at that point sgidpk was canceled and new stock was issued on the nasdaq exchange under the symbol sgic this new stock was distributed to the companys creditors and the sgid common stockholders were left with worthless shares at the end of that year the company moved its headquarters from mountain view to sunnyvale its earlier north shoreline headquarters is now occupied by the computer history museum the newer amphitheater parkway headquarters was sold to google both of these locations were awardwinning designs by studios architecturecitation needed in april  sgi reentered the visualization market with the sgi virtu range of visualization servers and workstations which were rebadged systems from boxx technologies based on intel xeon or amd opteron processors and nvidia quadro graphics chipsets running red hat enterprise linux suse linux enterprise server or windows compute cluster server final bankruptcy and acquisition by rackable systemsedit in december  sgi received a delisting notification from nasdaq as its market value had been below the minimum  million requirement for  consecutive trading days and also did not meet nasdaqs alternative requirements of a minimum stockholders equity of  million or annual net income from continuing operations of  or more on april   sgi filed for chapter  again and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to rackable systems for  million the sale ultimately for  million was finalized on may   at the same time rackable announced their adoption of silicon graphics international as their global name and brand the bankruptcy court scheduled continuing proceedings and hearings for june  and   and july  needs update after the rackable acquisition vizworld magazine published a series of six articles that chronicle the downfall of sgi graphics properties holdings inc eraedit during the silicon graphics incs second bankruptcy phase it was renamed to graphics properties holdings incgphi in june  in  gphi announced it had won a

over the validity of us patent   and silicon graphics incs voluntary dismissal of the us patent   patent from the lawsuit the federal circuit upheld the jury verdict on the validity of gphis us patent no  and furthermore found that amd had lost its right to challenge patent validity in future proceedings on january   the district court entered an order that permits amd to pursue its invalidity affirmative defense at trial and does not permit sgi to accuse amds radeon r series of graphics products of infringement in this case on april   gphi and amd had entered into a confidential settlement

starting with the iris integrated raster imaging system  series of highperformance graphics terminals were based on the motorola  family of microprocessors the later iris  and  models developed into full unix workstations iris  seriesedit the first entries in the  series models  and  introduced in  were graphics terminals peripherals to be connected to a generalpurpose computer such as a digital equipment corporation vax to provide graphical raster display abilities they used  mhz motorola  cpus with  kb of ram and had no disk drives they booted over the network via an excelan exos ethernet card from their controlling computer they used the pm cpu board which was a variant of the board that was used in stanford universitys sun workstation and later in the sun workstation from sun microsystems the graphics system was composed of the gf frame buffer the uc update controller dc display controller and the bp bitplane the series machines were designed around the multibus standard later series machines the  and  ran at  mhz and had  mb of ram the  had a  mb st disk drive while the  had a  mb smdbased disk drive with a xylogics  disk controller they may have used the pm cpu and pmm ram board from the  series the usual monitor for the  series ran at  hz interlaced six betatest units of the  workstation were produced and the first production unit sgis first commercial computer was shipped to carnegiemellon universitys electronic imaging laboratory in  iris  and  seriesedit geometry engine chip from an iris  sgi rapidly developed its machines into workstations with its second product line — the iris  series first released in august  sgi began using the unix system v operating system there were five models in two product ranges the  range which used  cpus the pm cpu module and the later turbo systems the t t and t which had s the ip cpu module all used the excelan exos ethernet card the same graphics hardware gf frame buffer uc update controller dc display controller bp bitplane their main differences were the cpu ram and weitek floating point accelerator boards disk controllers and disk drives both st and smd were available these could be upgraded for example from a  to a t the  and t had a larger chassis a standard   eia rack with space at the bottom for two smd disk drives weighing approximately  kg each the nonturbo models used the multibus for the cpu to communicate with the floating point accelerator while the turbos added a ribbon cable dedicated for this  hz monitors were used for the  series the height of the machines using motorola cpus was reached with the iris  series models  and  the s both being fullsize rack machines they used the same graphics subsystem and ethernet as the s but could also use up to  geometry engines the first widespread use of hardware graphics accelerators the standard monitor was a   hz noninterlaced unit with a tiltswivel base   hz interlaced and a   hz noninterlaced with tiltswivel base were also available the iris  and its smaller siblings were impressive for the time being complete unix workstations the  was powerful enough to support a complete d animation and rendering package without mainframe support with large capacity hard drives by standards of the day two  mb drives streaming tape and ethernet it could be the centerpiece of an animation operation the line was formally discontinued in november  with about  systems shipped of all  and  models combined risc eraedit with the introduction of the iris d series sgi switched to mips microprocessors these machines were more powerful and came with powerful onboard floatingpoint capability as d graphics became more popular in television and film during this time these systems were responsible for establishing much of sgis reputation sgi produced a broad range of mipsbased workstations and servers during the s running sgis version of unix system v now called irix these included the massive onyx visualization systems the size of refrigerators and capable of supporting up to  processors while managing up to three streams of high resolution fully realized d graphics in october  mips announced the first commercially available bit microprocessor the r sgi used the r in its crimson workstation irix  was the first fully bit irix release including bit pointers to secure the supply of future generations of mips microprocessors the bit r sgi acquired the company in  for  million and renamed it as mips technologies inc a wholly owned subsidiary of sgi in  silicon graphics sgi signed a deal with nintendo to develop the cpu used in the nintendo  a derivative of the ri microprocessor though the deal was signed in early  it was not made public until august of that year and the console itself would not be released until  in  relinquished mips technologies inc in a reipo in the late s when much of the industry expected the itanium to replace both cisc and risc architectures in nonembedded computers sgi announced their intent to phase out mips in their systems development of new mips microprocessors stopped and the existing r design was extended multiple times until  to provide existing customers more time to migrate to itanium in august  sgi announced the end of production for mipsirix systems and by the end of the year mipsirix products were no longer generally available from sgi iris gl and opengledit until the second generation onyx reality engine machines sgi offered access to its high performance d graphics subsystems through a proprietary api known as iris graphics language iris gl as more features were added over the years iris gl became harder to maintain and more cumbersome to use in  sgi decided to clean up and reform iris gl and made the bold move of allowing the resulting opengl api to be cheaply licensed by sgis competitors and set up an industrywide consortium to maintain the opengl standard the opengl architecture review board this meant that for the first time fast

was part of the advanced computing environment initiative formed in the early s with  other companies including compaq digital equipment corporation mips computer systems groupe bull siemens nec netpower microsoft and santa cruz operation its intent was to introduce workstations based on the mips architecture and able to run windows nt and sco unix the group produced the advanced risc computing arc specification but began to unravel little more than a year after its formation entertainment industryedit an sgi crimson system with the fsn threedimensional file system navigator appeared in the  movie jurassic park in the movie twister protagonists can be seen using an sgi laptop computer however the unit shown was not an actual working computer but rather a fake laptop shell built around an sgi corona lcd flat screen display the  film congo also features an sgi laptop computer being used by dr ross laura linney to communicate via satellite to travicom hq the purple lowercased sgi logo can be seen at the beginning of the opening credits of the hbo series silicon valley before being taken down and replaced by the google logo as the intro graphics progress google leased the former sgi buildings in  for their headquarters in mountain view ca until they purchased the buildings outright in  other onscreen credits include johnny mnemonic disclosure first kid jerry maguire how to make a monster the lawnmower man lost in space mission to mars men in black the peacemaker the relic sliver sphere swordfish viper tv series for eight consecutive years – all films nominated for an academy award for distinguished achievement in visual effects were created on silicon graphics computer systems once inexpensive pcs began to have graphics performance close to the more expensive specialized graphical workstations which were sgis core business sgi shifted its focus to high performance servers for digital video and the web many sgi graphics engineers left to work at other computer graphics companies such as ati and nvidia contributing to the pc d graphics revolution free softwareedit sgi was a promoter of free softwarecitation needed supporting several projects such as linux and samba and opening some of its own previously proprietary code such as the xfs filesystem and the open compiler acquisition of alias wavefront cray and intergraphedit in  sgi purchased alias research and wavefront technologies in a deal totaling approximately  million and merged the companies into aliaswavefront in june  sgi sold the business later renamed to alias systems corporation to the private equity investment firm accelkkr for  million in october  autodesk announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire alias for  million in cash in february  sgi purchased the wellknown supercomputer manufacturer cray research for  million and began to use marketing names such as craylink for sgideveloped technology integrated into the sgi server line three months later it sold crays business systems division responsible for the cs sparcsolaris server to sun microsystems for an undisclosed amount widely believed to be  million many of the cray te engineers designed and developed the sgi altix and numalink technology sgi sold the cray brand and product lines to tera computer company on march   for  million plus one million shares sgi also distributed its remaining interest in mips technologies through a spinoff effective june   in september  sgi acquired the zx series of windows workstations and servers from intergraph computer systems for a rumored  million these models were rebadged as sgi systems but discontinued in june  sgi visual workstationsedit another attempt by sgi in the late s to introduce its own family of intelbased workstations running windows nt or red hat linux see also sgi visual workstation proved to be a financial disaster and shook customer confidence in sgi’s commitment to its own mipsbased line switch to itaniumedit in  sgi announced that future generations of its machines would be based not on their own mips processors but the upcoming superchip from intel codenamed merced and later called itanium funding for its own highend processors was reduced and it was planned that the r would be the last mips mainstream processor mips technologies would focus entirely on the embedded market where it was having some success and sgi would no longer have to fund development of a cpu that since the failure of arc found use only in their own machines this plan quickly went awry as early as  it was clear the itanium was going to be delivered very late and would have nowhere near the performance originally expected as the production delays increased mips existing rbased machines grew increasingly uncompetitive eventually it was forced to introduce faster mips processors the r r and r which were used in a series of models from  through  sgis first itaniumbased system was the shortlived sgi  workstation launched in  sgis mipsbased systems were not to be superseded until the launch of the itanium based altix servers and prism workstations some time later unlike the mips systems which ran irix the itanium systems used suse linux enterprise server with sgi enhancements as their operating system sgi used transitive corporations quicktransit software to allow their old mipsirix applications to run in emulation on the new itaniumlinux platform in the server market the itanium based altix eventually replaced the mipsbased origin product line in the workstation market the switch to itanium was not completed before sgi exited the market the altix was the most powerful computer in the world in  assuming that a computer is defined as a collection of hardware running under a single instance of an operating system the altix had  itanium processors running under a single instance of linux a cluster of  machines was then the eighthfastest supercomputer all faster supercomputers were clusters but none have as many flops per machine however more recent supercomputers are very large clusters of machines that are individually less capable sgi acknowledged this and in  moved away from the massive numa model to clusters switch to xeonedit although sgi continued to market itaniumbased machines its more recent machines were based on the intel xeon processor the first altix xe systems were relatively lowend machines but by december  the xe systems were more capable than the itanium machines by some measures eg power consumption in flopsw density in flopsm costflops the xe and xe servers used a cluster architecture this was a departure from the pure numa architectures of the earlier itanium and mips servers in june  sgi announced the altix ice  a bladebased xeon system with up to  xeon cores per rack an altix ice  installed at new mexico computing applications center with  processors ranked at number  on the top list of november  user base and

when to remove this template message conventional wisdom holds that sgis core market has traditionally been hollywood visual effects studios in fact sgis largest revenue has always been generated by government and defense applications energy and scientific and technical computing the rise of cheap yet powerful commodity workstations running linux windows and mac os x and the availability of diverse professional software for them effectively pushed sgi out of the visual effects industry in all but the most niche markets highend server marketedit sgi continued to enhance its line of servers including some supercomputers based on the sn architecture sn for scalable node is a technology developed by sgi in the mids that uses cachecoherent nonuniform memory access ccnuma in an sn system processors memory and a bus and memorycontroller are coupled together into an entity called a node usually on a single circuit board nodes are connected by a highspeed interconnect called numalink originally marketed as craylink there is no internal bus and instead access between processors memory and io devices is done through a switched fabric of links and routers thanks to the cache coherence of the distributed shared memory sn systems scale along several axes at once as cpu count increases so does memory capacity io capacity and system bisection bandwidth this allows the combined memory of all the nodes to be accessed under a single os image using standard sharedmemory synchronization methods this makes an sn system far easier to program and able to achieve higher sustainedtopeak performance than noncachecoherent systems like conventional clusters or massively parallel computers which require applications code to be written or rewritten to do explicit messagepassing communication between their nodes the first sn system known as sn was released in  under the product name origin  based on the mips r processor it scaled from  to  processors and a smaller version the origin  sn scaled from  to  later enhancements enabled systems of as large as  processors the second generation system originally called sn but later snmips was released in july  as the origin  it scaled from  to  processors and processor configurations were delivered by special order to some customers a smaller less scalable implementation followed called origin  in november  sgi announced a repackaging of its sn system under the name origin  it quadrupled the processor area density of the snmips system from  up to  processors per rack while moving to a fat tree interconnect topology in january  sgi announced a variant of the sn platform called the altix  internally called snia it used intel itanium  processors and ran the linux operating system kernel at the time it was released it was the worlds most scalable linuxbased computer supporting up to  processors in a single system node nodes could be connected using the same numalink technology to form what sgi predictably termed superclusters in february  sgi announced general support for  processor nodes to be followed by  and  processor versions that year in april  sgi announced the sale of its alias software business for approximately  million in october  sgi built the supercomputer columbia which broke the world record for computer speed for the nasa ames research center it was a cluster of  altix supercomputers each with  intel itanium  processors running linux and achieved sustained speed of  trillion floatingpoint operations per second teraflops easily topping japans famed earth simulators record of  teraflops a week later ibms upgraded blue genel clocked in at  teraflops in july  sgi announced an sgi altix  system with  processors and  tb of memory running a single linux

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
