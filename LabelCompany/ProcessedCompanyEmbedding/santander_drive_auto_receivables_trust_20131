complaints against other rmbs trustees including deutsche bank citibank hsbc bank of new york mellon and wells fargo the complaints against us bank allege the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these rmbs trusts and assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality the complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default currently us bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple trusts as described above with
