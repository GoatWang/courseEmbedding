through this contract  of the contracts that offer the replaced fund as an investment option only allianz vision and allianz vision new york currently are offered for sale  under the contracts the insurance company applicants reserve the right subject to regulatory approval to substitute one of the investment options with another investment option after appropriate notice moreover the contracts permit the insurance company applicants to limit allocation of purchase payments to one or more subaccounts that invest in an investment option the prospectuses for the contracts also contain disclosure of these rights  the proposed substitution is due primarily to the fact that the replacement fund which has the same investment objective and substantially similar investment strategies as the replaced fund is managed by the same portfolio managers who previously managed the replaced fund the replacement funds portfolio is jointly managed by anne gudefin and charles lahr ms gudefin and mr lahr were hired by pimco at the end of  to manage the replacement fund on its inception in april  they previously served as the colead portfolio managers of the replaced fund since  as a result the replacement fund now is managed by the same portfolio managers and with substantially the same mandate and valueoriented style as the replaced fund prior to the transition the replaced fund on the other hand now is managed by a new portfolio management team  the proposed substitution also is part of an overall business plan of the insurance company applicants to make their respective products more efficient to monitor and administer and more competitive both in terms of new sales and the retention of existing business the insurance company applicants believe that more concentrated and streamlined operations for investment options will result in increased operational and administrative efficiencies and economies of scale for the insurance company applicants having added the replacement fund as an investment option to retain the ability for contract holders to invest in a valueoriented fund managed by ms gudefin and mr lahr the insurance company applicants believe that it would enhance operational and administrative efficiency to replace the replaced fund which with the same mandate and valueoriented style as the replacement fund is a largely redundant investment option  for these reasons and the reasons discussed below the applicants believe that substituting the replacement fund for the replaced fund is appropriate and in the best interests of the contract owners  the insurance company applicants believe that the replacement fund is an appropriate replacement for the replaced fund because its investment objective is the same both funds seek capital appreciation and its principal investment strategies are substantially the same as those of the replaced fund in addition because the principal investment risks of the replaced fund and the replacement fund are substantially the same the risk expectations of those contract owners with interests in the replaced fund will continue to be met after the substitution comparisons of the investment objectives principal investment policies and principal investment risks of the funds are set forth in the application  the following chart compares the management fees and the total annual fund operating expenses before and after any waivers and reimbursements for the year ended december   expressed as an annual percentage of average daily net assets of the replaced fund and the

responsible both for providing various supervisory and administrative services and for paying the expenses of various other services such as audits transfer agent registrar custodial services shareholder meetings ordinary legal fees and fidelity bondinsurance premiums as compensation for these services pimco receives a supervisory and administrative fee of  in its prospectus the replacement fund discloses this fee together with the investment advisory fee as a combined management fee of  the expenses incurred by the replaced fund for similar administrative services are included under other expenses pimco has contractually agreed through may   to reduce its advisory fee by  of the average daily net assets of the portfolio this fee limitation agreement renews annually unless terminated by pimco upon at least  days prior notice to the end of the contract term under certain conditions pimco may recoup amounts reduced in future periods not exceeding three years  the assets and performance of the funds for the years ending december   and december   are set forth in the application  applicants hereby request the commissions approval to effect the substitution of shares of the replacement fund for shares of the replaced fund as follows institutional class shares of the pimco eqs pathfinder portfolio for class  shares of the mutual global discovery securities fund and advisor class shares of the pimco eqs pathfinder portfolio for class  shares of the mutual global discovery securities fund  at the close of business on the substitution date allianz life and allianz ny will each redeem shares of the replaced fund held by their separate accounts inkind or in cash or a combination thereof and apply the proceeds of such redemptions to the purchase of shares of the replacement fund thus after the substitution each subaccount of the separate accounts previously holding shares of the replaced fund will hold shares of the replacement fund  redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that redemption of replaced fund shares and purchase of replacement fund shares will both occur at the price for such shares computed as of the close of business on the substitution date in a manner consistent with rule c under the  act as a result the full net asset value of the replaced fund shares held by the separate account applicants will be reflected in the contract owners contract values following the substitution without reduction for brokerage or other such fees or charges all expenses incurred in connection with the substitution including legal accounting transactional and other fees and expenses including brokerage commissions will be paid by allianz life allianz ny or pimco accordingly contract value attributable to contract owners then invested in the replaced fund will remain fully invested at all times and the substitution will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the applicable separate account  affected contract owners will not incur any fees or charges in connection with the substitution so that the net asset value of redeemed shares of the replaced fund held by the separate account applicants will be reflected in the contract owners contract values following the substitution moreover neither the obligations of the respective insurance company applicants under the contracts nor the rights of contract owners will be altered in any way by the substitution the substitution will not impose any tax liability or have any adverse tax consequences on contract owners the substitution will not cause contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing owners of contracts to be greater after the substitution than they were before the substitution for a period of at least  days following the substitution neither allianz life nor allianz ny will exercise any right they may have under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers  the insurance company applicants represent that pimco and the replacement fund will enter into a written contract agreeing that during the  months following the substitution date the total annual fund operating expenses net of any acquired fund fees and expenses of the replacement fund taking into account applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements will not exceed the total annual fund operating expenses net of any acquired fund fees and expenses of the replaced fund for the fiscal year ended december   this contractual expense limitation will be set at  for institutional class shares and  for advisor class shares in addition for the  months following the substitution date the insurance company applicants will not increase separate account fees and charges for the contracts outstanding on the substitution date thereafter total annual fund operating expenses for the replacement fund will vary from year to year and may exceed those of the replaced fund  contract owners have been notified of the application by means of a notice of substitution sent on may   stating that the applicants filed the initial application and seek approval for the substitution the notice of substitution set forth the anticipated substitution date and advised affected contract owners that on the substitution date contract values allocated to subaccounts investing in shares of the replaced fund will be transferred to subaccounts investing in shares of the replacement fund without charge including sales charges or surrender charges and without being counted toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge  the notice of substitution also stated that from the date of the notice may   through the date  days after the substitution the “free transfer period” the respective insurance company applicants will allow the affected contract owners to make one transfer of contract value held in each subaccount investing in the replaced fund before the substitution or replacement fund after the substitution to one or more investment options available pursuant to the contracts subject to any investment option allocation restrictions under their contract without charge and without assessing transfer fees such a transfer will not be counted as a transfer request under any contractual provisions of the contracts that limit the number of transfers that may be made without charge further prior to the substitution all affected contract owners will receive a copy of the most recent prospectus for the replacement fund  within five days following the substitution the insurance company applicants will send a postsubstitution notice to affected contract owners stating that the substitution was carried out and reiterating the information set forth in the notice including a reminder that the free transfer period will continue through the date  days after the substitutionstart printed page  applicants legal analysis and conditions section c relief  applicants submit that the substitution does not present the type of costly forced redemption or other harms that section c of the act was intended to guard against and is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the  act the substitution is consistent with contract owners objectives and risk expectations because the investment objective principal investment strategies and risks of the replacement fund are substantially similar to those of the replaced fund in addition the total annual fund operating expenses of the replacement fund will be no higher than those of the replaced fund after applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements that will be in place for the replacement fund for a period of at least  months following the substitution  applicants represent that for a period of  months from the date of the substitution the pimco eqs pathfinder portfolio will be subject to an expense cap  for institutional class shares  for advisor class shares limiting its total annual fund operating expenses net of any acquired fund fees and expenses to an amount not to exceed the total annual fund operating expenses of the mutual global discovery securities fund net of any acquired fund fees and expenses for the fiscal year ended december   in addition for the  months following the substitution date the insurance company applicants will not increase separate account fees and charges for the contracts outstanding on the substitution date  owners of contracts who are beneficial shareholders of the replaced fund have been provided with appropriate notice of the substitution and free transfer period no b fees are assessed to class  shares of the replaced fund or the institutional class shares of the replacement fund identical b fees of  of average daily net assets are assessed to class  shares of the replaced fund and the advisor class shares of the replacement fund  applicants submit that the investment objectives are the same and the investment strategies are substantially the same for both funds both primarily invest in equity securities and securities convertible into or that the adviser expects to be exchanged for common or preferred stock of issuers that the manager believes are undervalued the risks are similar for both funds and are consistent with the risks generally applicable to the types of securities such as valueoriented equity securities arbitrage securities and distressed companies and foreign securities in which both funds invest  in addition to identical investment objectives and substantially similar principal investment strategies and risks as well as total annual fund operating expenses that are expected to be no higher after waivers the advisory services that are provided to the replacement fund by its investment adviser are comparable to the types of advisory services provided to the replaced fund by its investment adviser the investment advisory fee paid to pimco by the replacement fund  is slightly lower than the investment advisory fee paid to franklin mutual advisers by the replaced fund   the contracts contain features that provide adequate protection to contract owners in the event of a substitution moreover the substitution will be subject to the following  a contract owner may request that his or her contract value be reallocated to another investment option subject to any investment option allocation restrictions under their contract at any time during the free transfer period without charge the free transfer period provides sufficient time for contract owners to reconsider their investment options  the substitution will be at the net asset value of the respective shares without the imposition of any transfer brokerage or similar charge  neither the contract owners the replaced fund nor the replacement fund will bear any costs of the substitution and all legal accounting and transactional costs and any brokerage or other costs incurred in the substitution will be paid by the insurance company applicants or pimco and accordingly the substitution will have no impact on the contract owners contract values  the substitution will in no way alter the contractual obligations of the insurance company applicants or the rights and privileges of contract owners under the contracts and  the substitution will in no way alter the tax benefits to contract owners  the applicants on the basis of the facts and circumstances described above and in the application have determined that it is in the best interests of contract owners to substitute shares of the replaced fund with shares of the replacement fund  applicants submit that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act section b relief  the section  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from section a of the  act to the extent necessary to permit allianz life and allianz ny to carry out the substitution by redeeming shares of the replaced fund in kind and using such proceeds to purchase shares of the replacement fund  section a of the  act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of an affiliated person acting as principal from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company section a of the  act prohibits any of the persons described above acting as principal from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company  applicants may be considered affiliates of the replacement fund based upon the definition of “affiliated person” in section a of the  act shares of the replacement fund are held by the separate accounts because shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company allianz life and allianz ny and their affiliates collectively own of record shares of the replacement fund further pimco which is an affiliated person of the replacement fund by virtue of section ae of the  act is like allianz life and allianz ny a wholly owned subsidiary of allianz se for these reasons the replacement fund is arguably under the control of allianz life and allianz ny notwithstanding the fact that contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the separate accounts if the replacement fund is under the control of allianz life and allianz ny then each of allianz life and allianz ny or any person controlling allianz life and allianz ny or any person under common control with allianz life and allianz ny is an affiliated person of the replacement fund similarly if the replacement fund is under the control of allianz life and allianz ny then the replacement fund is an affiliated person of allianz life and allianz ny and of any persons that control allianz life and allianz ny or are under start printed page common control with allianz life and allianz ny  at the close of business on the substitution date the insurance company applicants will redeem shares of the replaced fund either inkind or in cash or a combination thereof and use the proceeds of such redemptions to purchase shares of the replacement fund with each subaccount of the applicable separate account investing the proceeds of its redemption from the replaced fund in the replacement fund thus the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the replaced fund to allianz life and allianz ny immediately thereafter allianz life and allianz ny would purchase shares of the replacement fund with the portfolio securities andor cash received from the replaced fund this aspect of the substitution may be deemed to involve one or more sales by allianz life or allianz ny of securities or other property to the replacement fund and could therefore be viewed as being prohibited by section a of the l act accordingly the section  applicants seek relief from section a of the  act for the inkind purchases and sales of the replacement fund shares  any inkind redemptions and purchases for purposes of the substitution will be effected in a manner consistent with the investment objectives and strategies of the replaced fund and the replacement fund pimco will review the securities holdings of the replaced fund and determine which of the replaced funds portfolio holdings would be suitable investments for the replacement fund in the overall context of the replacement funds investment objective and strategies and consistent with pimcos management of the replacement fund pimco will accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for the replacement fund in a cash transaction the section  applicants submit that these portfolio securities will be of the type and quality that the replacement fund would have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash  the section  applicants state that any securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds and subsequently contributed to the replacement fund to effect the contemplated inkind purchases of shares will be valued based on valuation procedures adopted by the board of the pimco eqs vit the redeeming and purchasing values will be the same consistent with rule ad under the  act no brokerage commissions fees or other remuneration will be paid by the replaced fund or the replacement fund in connection with the inkind transactions if pimco declines to accept particular portfolio securities of the replaced fund for purchase inkind of shares of the replacement fund those positions will be liquidated by the replaced fund and shares of the replacement fund will be purchased with cash  section b of the  act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a of the l act if the evidence establishes that  the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned  the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and records found under the  act and  the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the  act  the section  applicants submit that the terms of the substitution including the consideration to be paid and received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a under the  act the use of inkind transactions will not cause

change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the separate accounts the proposed transactions cannot be effected at a price that is disadvantageous to either the replaced fund or the replacement fund contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitution fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitution even though they may not rely on rule a under the  act the section  applicants submit that the rules conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons  the board of the pimco eqs vit has adopted procedures as required by paragraph e of rule a under the  act pursuant to which the replacement fund may purchase and sell securities to and from its affiliates the section  applicants will carry out the proposed inkind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a under the act and the replacement funds policies and procedures relating to rule a under the act except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash nevertheless the circumstances surrounding the proposed substitution will be such as to offer to the replacement fund the same degree of protection from overreaching that rule a under the act provides to the replacement fund generally in connection with

will be provided a prospectus for the replacement fund in addition contract owners will have the opportunity to make a free transfer from the replacement fund to any other available investment option offered under their contract subject to any investment option allocation start printed page restrictions under their contract during the free transfer period  the section  applicants also submit that the substitution is consistent with the policies of the replaced fund and the replacement fund as recited in the current registration statement and reports filed under the  act  in addition the section  applicants submit that the proposed substitution is consistent with the general purposes of the  act as stated in the findings and declaration of policy in section  of the  act the proposed transactions do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the  act was designed to prevent securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds from the replaced fund and subsequently contributed to the replacement fund to effect the contemplated inkind purchases of shares will be valued in accordance with the requirements of rule a under the l act therefore there will be no change in value to

company and advisersubadviser included in the investment options section of the prospectus for the above mentioned investment option will be updated as follows managed by allianz investment management

are attractively valued that currently pay dividends and have the potential for earnings and dividend growth over time may invest a significant portion of its assets in securities and instruments that are economically tied to foreign countries  azl money market fund in july  the us securities and exchange commission adopted certain amendments to the regulations governing money market mutual funds which will change significantly the way that certain money market funds will be required to operate at its meeting on june   the board of trustees of the allianz variable insurance products trust considered the likely effects of the rule changes on the azl money market fund and approved changes proposed by the fund s manager allianz investment management llc to the name and principal investment strategies of the fund as a result of these changes the fund will become a government money market fund and will be called the azl government money market fund as a government money market fund the fund will be permitted subject to the revised regulations to continue to use a stable net asset value  and the fund will not be required to impose fees on shareholder redemptions or to temporarily suspend redemptions in the event that the fund s weekly liquid assets fall below a certain threshold the board believes that this result is in the best interests of the fund and its shareholders the changes to the fund are expected to be fully implemented by may   prior to the final compliance dates for the new rules however it is anticipated that the fund s subadviser blackrock advisors llc will begin immediately to gradually implement changes to the fund s portfolio in order to provide the most efficient transition as a result it is expected that the fund gradually will allocate a larger percentage of its assets to government securities over time until it reaches its new allocation on or about may  because the yields on government securities generally may be expected to be lower than the yields on comparable nongovernment securities it should be expected that the fund s yield will decrease as more assets are invested in government securities as a result of these changes approved by the board of trustees the fund is no longer subject to the requirement that it invest at least  of its assets in the financial services industry effective on or about may   the name of the fund will be changed to azl government money market fund and the primary investments included in the investment options section of the prospectus is expected to be updated to the following

each contract will either not be decreased or in those cases where the number of investment options is being reduced continue to offer a significant number of alternative investment options specifically the number of investment options is currently expected to range in number from  to  after the substitutions versus  to  before the substitutions  at the close of business on the day of the substitution the “substitution date” insurance company applicants will each redeem shares of the replaced funds held by their separate accounts in kind and apply the proceeds of such redemptions to the purchase shares of the corresponding replacement funds thus after the substitutions each subaccount of the separate accounts previously holding shares of a replaced fund will hold shares of the corresponding replacement fund  redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that redemption of replaced fund shares and purchase of replacement fund shares will both occur at the price for such shares computed as of the close of business on the substitution date in a manner consistent with rule c under the  act as a result the full net asset value of the replaced fund shares held by the separate accounts will be reflected in the contractowners contract values following the substitutions without reduction for brokerage or other such fees or charges all expenses incurred in connection with the substitutions including legal accounting transactional and other fees and expenses including brokerage start printed page commissions will be paid by insurance company applicants or the manager of the replacement funds accordingly contract value attributable to contractowners then invested in the replaced funds will remain fully invested at all times and the substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contractowners contract value death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in the applicable separate account  affected contractowners will not incur any fees or charges in connection with the substitutions so that the net asset value of redeemed shares of the replaced funds held by the separate accounts will be reflected in the contractowners contract values following the substitutions moreover neither the obligations of the respective insurance company applicants under the contracts nor the rights of contractowners will be altered in any way by the substitutions the substitutions will not impose any tax liability or have any adverse tax consequences on contractowners the substitutions will not cause contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing owners of contracts to be greater after the substitutions than they were before the substitutions for a period of at least  days following the substitutions insurance company applicants will not exercise any right it may have under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers except pursuant to any investment option allocation restrictions under the contracts  from the date that notice of the substitutions was provided to affected contractowners by means of a prospectus supplement the “presubstitution supplement” through the date  days after the substitution the “free transfer period” the respective insurance company applicants will allow the affected contractowners to make one transfer of contract value held in each subaccount investing in the replaced funds before the substitutions or replacement fund after the substitutions to one or more investment options available pursuant to the contracts without charge and without assessing transfer fees such a transfer also will not be counted as a transfer request under any contractual provisions of the contracts that limit the number of transfers that may be made without charge  under the manager of managers order subject to the approval of the board of trustees of the vip trust azim may retain one or more subadvisers for any fund of the vip trust without the approval of shareholders of the fund however after the substitution date insurance company applicants represent that azim will not retain any new subadviser for the azl sp  index fund and the azl small cap stock index fund or otherwise rely on the manager of managers order in connection with azl sp  index fund and the azl small cap stock index fund without first obtaining shareholder approval of either  the new subadviser or  the funds ability to rely on the manager of managers order  notice of the substitutions and free transfer period has been given to all affected contractowners by means of the presubstitution supplement for each of the contracts stating that applicants have filed the application and seek approval of the substitutions the presubstitution supplement sets forth the anticipated substitution date and advises affected contractowners that contract values allocated to subaccounts investing in shares of the replaced funds will be transferred to subaccounts investing in shares of the replacement funds without charge including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge on the substitution date the presubstitution supplement states that during the free transfer period affected contractowners may make one transfer of contract value from each subaccount investing in a replaced fund before the substitutions or a replacement fund after the substitutions to one or more other subaccounts subject to any investment option allocation restrictions under their contract without charge and without the transfer counting against any limitations on transfers further prior to the substitutions all affected contractowners will receive a copy of the most recent prospectus for the replacement funds  within five days following the substitutions insurance company applicants will send a written notice to affected contractowners stating that the substitutions were carried out and reiterating the information set forth in the presubstitution supplement  for those who were contractowners on the date of the proposed substitutions insurance company applicants will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the  months following the substitution date those contractowners whose subaccount invests in any replacement fund such that the sum of such replacement funds a operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements net of any acquired fund fees and expenses and b assetbased fees and charges for the contracts for such period will not exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the corresponding replaced funds operating expenses taking into account any fee waiver or expense reimbursement and subaccount expenses for the fiscal year ended december   thereafter expenses for the replacement funds will vary from year to year and may exceed those of the corresponding replaced funds applicants legal analysis  applicants represent that section c of the  act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the commission approves the substitution applicants note that the commission will approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act  applicants note the legislative history makes clear that congress intended section c of the  act to provide the commission scrutiny of proposed substitutions that could otherwise in effect force shareholders dissatisfied with the substituted security to redeem their shares thereby possibly incurring either a loss of the sales load deducted from initial purchase payments an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption or both  applicants assert that section c of the  act would not appear to have been designed to prohibit transactions like the substitutions in which a number of customer protections are provided including the fact that the applicable unit investment trusts the separate accounts offer in excess of  different investment options  applicants claim that the purposes terms and conditions of the substitutions are consistent with the principles and purposes of section c of the  act and do not entail any of the abuses that section c of the  act is designed to prevent contractowners will not be assessed charges in connection with the substitutions and their annual fund net total operating expenses are expected to remain the same or decrease in addition to the extent a contractowner does not wish to participate in the start printed page substitutions he or she is free to make one transfer to any other option available under the relevant contract at any time prior to the date of the substitutions or during the day period following the date of the substitutions without any transfer fee and without that transfer counting as a transfer request under any contractual provisions of the contracts that limit the number of transfers that may be made without charge moreover the contracts have features that applicants believe provide adequate protection to contractowners these features include  a significant number of different investment options  investment options that are reasonably diversified  investment options that are reasonably seasoned  reasonable transferability between investment options  investment choices that include an option that is intended to reduce or eliminate fluctuation of principal and  reasonable liquidity in the form of free partial withdrawal rights  in addition contractowners will be substituted into replacement funds whose investment objectives principal investment policies and risks applicants believe will be substantially similar or virtually identical to those of the corresponding replaced funds with net total operating expenses that are anticipated to be equal to or less than those of their corresponding replaced funds like the replaced funds which are not assessed a b fee their corresponding replacement funds will not be assessed a b fee  in addition to substantially similar or virtually identical investment objectives principal investment policies and risks as well as anticipated equal or lower net total operating expenses applicants maintain that the types of investment advisory and administrative services that will be provided to the replacement funds by their subadvisers will be comparable to the types of investment advisory and administrative services currently provided to the replaced funds by their respective investment advisers contractowners who become beneficial owners of the replacement funds as a result of the proposed substitutions will enjoy continuity of their asset manager these replacement funds will be managed by azim but the asset management activity will be handled by the subadviser that currently manages the corresponding replaced fund  moreover because the replacement funds operate pursuant to the manager of managers order applicants believe that the proposed substitutions will provide protection to contractowners by giving azim the flexibility to change the subadvisers of the replacement funds should such a change become warranted or advisable thus applicants will provide contractowners with investment vehicles following the substitutions that will be substantially similar to those offered prior to the substitutions  in further support of their contention that the substitutions do not present the type of costly forced redemption or other harms that section c of the  act was intended to guard against and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the  act applicants note that the substitutions will be subject to the following terms and conditions  a contractowner may request that his or her contract value be reallocated to another investment option subject to any investment option allocation restrictions under their contract at any time during the free transfer period without charge the free transfer period provides sufficient time for contractowners to reconsider their investment options  the substitutions will be at net asset value of the respective shares without the imposition of any transfer brokerage or similar charge  neither the contractowners the replaced funds nor the replacement funds will bear any costs of the substitutions and all legal accounting and transactional costs and any brokerage or other costs incurred in the substitutions will be paid by insurance company applicants or the managers to the replacement funds and accordingly the substitutions will have no impact on the contractowners contract values  the substitutions will in no way alter the contractual obligations of insurance company applicants or the rights and privileges of contractowners under the contracts and  the substitutions will in no way alter the tax benefits to contractowners  applicants request an order of the commission pursuant to section c of the  act approving the substitutions on the terms set forth in this application applicants believe for all of the reasons stated above that each substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act  section  applicants also request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from section a of the  act to the extent necessary to permit insurance company applicants to carry out the substitutions by redeeming shares of the replaced funds in kind and using the proceeds to purchase shares of the replacement funds  section a of the  act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of an affiliated person acting as principal from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company section a of the  act prohibits any of the persons described above acting as principal from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company section a of the  act defines the term “affiliated person” of another person in relevant part as a any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote five per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of such other person b any person five per centum or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned controlled or held with power to vote by such other person c any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person d any officer director partner copartner or employee of such other person e if such other person is an investment company any investment adviser thereof or any member of an advisory board thereof and f if such other person is an unincorporated investment company not having a board of directors the depositor thereof  applicants may be considered affiliates of each of the replacement funds based upon the definition of “affiliated person” in section a of the  act shares of the funds of the vip trust are held solely by separate accounts because shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company insurance company applicants and their affiliates collectively own of record all of the shares of the funds of the vip trust including the replacement funds further azim an affiliated person of the vip trust by virtue of section a e of the  act is a wholly owned subsidiary of allianz life for these reasons the vip trust and the replacement funds are arguably under the control of insurance company applicants notwithstanding the fact that contractowners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the separate accounts if the vip trust and the replacement funds are under the control of insurance company applicants then insurance company applicants or any person controlling start printed page insurance company applicants or any person under common control with insurance company applicants is an affiliated person of the vip trust and the replacement funds similarly if the vip trust and the replacement funds are under the control of insurance company applicants then the vip trust and the replacement funds are affiliated persons of insurance company applicants and of any persons that control insurance company applicants or are under common control with insurance company applicants at the close of business on the substitution date insurance company applicants will redeem shares of the replaced funds either in kind or in cash and use the proceeds of such redemptions to purchase shares of the corresponding replacement funds with each subaccount of the applicable separate account investing the proceeds of its redemption from the replaced funds in the applicable replacement funds thus the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the replaced funds to insurance company applicants immediately thereafter insurance company applicants would purchase shares of the replacement funds with the portfolio securities received from the replaced funds this aspect of the substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more sales by insurance company applicants of securities or other property to the replacement funds accordingly this aspect of the substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by section a of the  act accordingly section  applicants seek relief from section a of the  act for the inkind purchases and sales of the replacement fund shares  section  applicants assert that any inkind redemptions and purchases for purposes of the substitutions will be effected in a manner consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the replacement funds subject to the oversight of azim the subadvisers of each of the replacement funds will review the securities holdings of their corresponding replaced fund and determine which of the replaced fund holdings would be suitable investments for the corresponding replacement fund in the overall context of that replacement funds investment objective and policies and consistent with their management of the replacement fund and will accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction section  applicants submit that these portfolio securities will be of the type and quality that the replacement funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash  section  applicants state that any securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds and subsequently contributed to the replacement funds to effect the contemplated inkind purchases of shares will be valued in accordance with the normal valuation procedures of the redeeming and purchasing portfolios the redeeming and purchasing values will be the same consistent with rule ad under the  act no brokerage commissions fees or other remuneration will be paid by the replaced funds or the replacement funds in connection with the inkind transactions if azim declines to accept particular portfolio securities of any of the replaced funds for purchase of inkind shares of any of the replacement funds those positions will be liquidated by the applicable replaced fund and shares of the corresponding replacement fund will be purchased with cash  section b of the  act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a of the  act if the evidence establishes that  the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned  the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and records found under the  act and  the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the  act  section  applicants submit that the terms of the substitutions including the consideration to be paid and received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a under the  act the use of inkind transactions will not cause contractowner interests to be diluted the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the  act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contractowners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the separate accounts contractowners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions even though they may not rely on rule a under the  act section  applicants submit that the rules conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons  the board of the vip trust has adopted procedures as required by paragraph e of rule a under the  act the “a procedures” pursuant to which the replacement funds may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates section  applicants will carry out the proposed inkind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a and the a procedures except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash nevertheless the circumstances surrounding the proposed substitutions will be such as to offer to each replacement fund the same degree of protection from overreaching that rule a provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of their business in particular insurance company applicants or any of their affiliates cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the replacement funds although the transactions may not be entirely for cash each will be effected based upon  the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph b of rule a and  the net asset value per share of each fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective registration statement and as required by rule c under the  act no brokerage commission fee or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed transactions the transactions will be reviewed by the chief compliance officer of the vip trust or his agents and will be reported to the vip trusts board of trustees in the same manner as any other a transaction by any of the replacement funds would be reported  section  applicants also submit that the inkind portfolio security transactions are consistent with the policies of the replacement funds and the vip trust as recited in the current registration statements and reports filed by each under the  act start printed page   in addition section  applicants submit that the proposed inkind portfolio security transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act as stated in the findings and declaration of policy in section  of the  act the proposed transactions do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the  act was designed to prevent further section  applicants note that securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds and subsequently contributed to the replacement funds to effect the contemplated inkind purchases of shares will be valued based on the normal valuation procedures of the redeeming replaced funds and purchasing replacement funds therefore there will be no change in value to any contractowner as a result of the substitutions conclusion applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above that the proposed substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of section c of the act and are consistent with the standards of section b of the act and that the requested orders should be granted start signature for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated authority

and exchange commission adopted certain amendments to the regulations governing money market mutual funds which will change significantly the way that certain money market funds will be required to operate at its meeting on june   the board of trustees of the allianz variable insurance products trust considered the likely effects of the rule changes on the azl money market fund and approved changes proposed by the fund s manager allianz investment management llc to the name and principal investment strategies of the fund as a result of these changes the fund will become a government money market fund and will be called the azl government money market fund as a government money market fund the fund will be permitted subject to the revised regulations to continue to use a stable net asset value  and the fund will not be required to impose fees on shareholder redemptions or to temporarily suspend redemptions in the event that the fund s weekly liquid assets fall below a certain threshold the board believes that this result is in the best interests of the fund and its shareholders the changes to the fund are expected to be fully implemented by may   prior to the final compliance dates for the new rules however it is anticipated that the fund s subadviser blackrock advisors llc will begin immediately to gradually implement changes to the fund s portfolio in order to provide the most efficient transition as a result it is expected that the fund gradually will allocate a larger percentage of its assets to government securities over time until it reaches its new allocation on or about may  because the yields on government securities generally may be expected to be lower than the yields on comparable nongovernment securities it should be expected that the fund s yield will decrease as more assets are invested in government securities as a result of these changes approved by the board of trustees the fund is no longer subject to the requirement that it invest at least  of its assets in the financial services industry effective on or about may   the name of the fund will be changed to azl government money market fund and the primary investments included in the investment options section of the prospectus is expected to be updated to the following invests at least  of its total assets in cash government securities or repurchase agreements that are collateralized fully investments include us treasury bills notes and other obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities and repurchase agreements secured by such obligations in addition the fund may invest in variable and floating rate instruments  allianz life insurance company of new york address the address for

is possible that some portions of the contract are in the accumulation phase and other portions are in the annuity phase at the same time the annuity phase begins on the income date or the first income date if you take any partial annuitizations and ends when all portions of the contract that you apply to annuity payments have ended as indicated in section  the annuity phase  gmib partial annuitizations are based on the gmib value and are not available until the fifth contract anniversary and they are not available if the gmib value is less than the contract value your investment choices include the investment options and any available general account investment choice you cannot invest in more than  investment options at any one time depending upon market conditions you can gain or lose value in the contract based on the investment performance of the investment options the investment options are designed to offer the opportunity for a better return than any available general account investment choice however this is not guaranteed the amount of contract value you are able to accumulate in your contract during the accumulation phase and the amount of any variable traditional annuity payments we make during the annuity phase depend in large part upon the investment performance of any investment options you select  the only general account investment choices available during the accumulation phase are the fixed period accounts fpas you can allocate up to  of any purchase payment to the fpas during the accumulation phase however in some states the fpas may only be available for gav transfers we make if your contract includes the living guarantees in addition we may transfer more than  of the total purchase payments to the fpas beginning on the second contract anniversary in order to support the living guarantees the fpas have account periods ranging from one to ten years only one fpa is available for purchase payments or transfers in each contract year amounts allocated to the fpas earn interest that we declare periodically if you have money invested in the fpas the amount of contract value you are able to accumulate in your contract during the

section  our general account market value adjustment mva we do not make any changes to your contract without your permission except as may be required by law the contract ends when the accumulation phase ends the annuity phase if any ends andor if we received a valid claim all applicable death benefit payments have been made for example if you purchased a contract and later take a full withdrawal of the entire contract value both the accumulation phase and the contract end although the annuity phase never began and we did not make any death benefit payments state specific contract restrictions the contract is subject to the law of the state in which it was issued some of the terms of your contract may differ from the terms of a contract delivered in another state because of statespecific legal requirements areas in which there may be statespecific contract provisions may include but are not limited to the following the withdrawal charge schedule availability of

restrict transfer rights all material state variations in the contract are disclosed in this prospectus if you would like more information regarding statespecific contract provisions you should contact your financial professional or contact our service center at the toll free number listed at the back of this prospectus ownership owner you as the owner have all the rights under the contract the owner was designated at contract issue the owner may be a nonindividual which is anything other than an individual person which could be a trust qualified plan or corporation qualified contracts can only have one owner you can change owners at any time subject to our approval upon our approval any ownership change becomes effective as of the date you sign the request changing ownership may be a taxable event you should consult with your tax adviser before doing this joint owner nonqualified contracts can be owned by up to two owners upon the death of either joint owner the surviving joint owner becomes the sole primary beneficiary we then treat any other beneficiary designation on record at the time of death as a contingent beneficiary you can change joint owners under the same conditions as described for an owner if a contract has joint owners we generally require the signature of both owners on any forms that are submitted to our service center note partial annuitizations are not available to joint owners there can be only one owner the owner must be the annuitant and we do not allow the owner to add a joint annuitant  annuitant the annuitant is the individual on whose life we base annuity payments you designated an annuitant when you purchased a contract for qualified contracts before the income date the owner must be the annuitant unless the contract is owned by a qualified plan or is part of a custodial arrangement you can change the annuitant on an individually owned nonqualified contract at any time before the income date but you cannot change the annuitant if the owner is a nonindividual for example a qualified plan or trust subject to our approval you can add a joint annuitant on the income date if you take a full annuitization for qualified contracts the ability to add a joint annuitant is subject to any plan requirements associated with the contract and the joint annuitants must be spouses for jointly owned contracts if the annuitant dies before the annuity date the younger owner automatically becomes the new annuitant but the owner can subsequently name another annuitant designating different persons as owners and annuitants can have important impacts on whether a death benefit is paid and on who would receive it for example if a sole owner dies during the accumulation phase of the contract we pay a death benefit to the beneficiarys if the annuitant is not an owner and heshe dies during the accumulation phase of the contract the owner can name a new annuitant subject to our approval and we do not pay a death benefit if a sole owner who is not an annuitant dies during the annuity phase the beneficiary becomes the owner annuity payments continue and we do not pay a death benefit if an annuitant dies after a full annuitization under an annuity option with a guaranteed period annuity payments to the payee continue until the contract ends and are paid at least as rapidly as they were being paid at the time of the annuitant s death use care when designating owners and annuitants and consult your financial professional if you have questions payee the payee is the person or entity who receives annuity payments during the annuity phase the owner receives tax reporting on those payments generally we require the payee to be an owner however we may allow you to name a charitable trust financial

death unless you name an irrevocable beneficiary if a beneficiary predeceases you or you and a beneficiary die simultaneously as defined by applicable state law or regulation that beneficiary s interest in this contract ends unless your beneficiary designation specifies otherwise if there are no surviving beneficiaries or if there is no named beneficiary we pay the death benefit to your estate or the owner if the owner is a nonindividual note for jointly owned contracts the sole primary beneficiary is the surviving joint owner regardless of any other named beneficiaries spousal joint owners may also appoint contingent beneficiaries however joint owners who are not spouses may not appoint contingent beneficiaries if both joint owners who were never spouses die before we pay the death benefit we pay the death benefit to the estate of the joint owner who died last if both spousal joint owners die simultaneously as defined by applicable state law or regulation we pay the death

instructions we allocate any additional purchase payments according to your future purchase payment allocation instructions you can only allocate up to  of any purchase payment to the fpas during the

investment options that you can invest in at any one time currently you can invest in up to  of the investment options at any one time we may change this in the future however we always allow you to invest in at least five investment options if you make additional purchase payments we add this money to your contract on the business day we receive it in good order our business day closes when regular trading on the new york stock exchange closes if you submit a purchase payment to your financial professional we do not begin processing the payment until we receive it a purchase payment is received when it arrives at the address for mailing checks listed at the back of this prospectus regardless of how or when you submitted the payment we forward purchase payments we receive at the wrong address to the last address listed at the back of this prospectus  energy lane suite  which may delay processing taxfree section  exchanges subject to certain restrictions you can make a taxfree exchange under section  of the internal revenue code for all or a portion of one annuity contract for another or all of a life insurance policy for an annuity contract before making an exchange you should compare both contracts carefully remember that if you exchange a life insurance policy or annuity contract for the contract described in this prospectus you might have to pay a withdrawal charge on your previous contract there is a new withdrawal charge period for this contract other charges under this contract may be higher or lower the benefits may be different and you no longer have access to any benefits from your previous contract if the exchange does not qualify for section  treatment you also may have to pay federal income tax including a possible additional federal tax on the exchange you should not exchange an existing life insurance policy or another annuity contract for this contract unless you determine the exchange is in your best interest and not just better for the person selling you the contract who generally earns a commission on each sale you should consult a tax adviser to discuss the potential tax effects before making a  exchange  accumulation unitscomputing the contract value your contract value in the subaccounts separate account value increase and decrease based upon the investment performance of the investment options you choose your contract value is also affected by the charges of the contract any interest you earn on any general account investment choices and any mvas made due to amounts removed from the fpas in order to keep track of your separate account value we use a measurement called an accumulation unit if you request variable traditional annuity payments during the annuity phase of the contract we call this measurement an annuity unit when we receive a purchase payment we credit your contract with accumulation units for any portion of your purchase payment allocated to an investment option at the daily price next determined after receipt of the purchase payment at our service center the daily purchase price is normally determined at the end of each business day and any purchase payment received at or after the end of the current business day receives the next business day s price the purchase payments you allocate to the investment options are actually placed into subaccounts each subaccount invests exclusively in one investment option we determine the number of accumulation units we credit to your contract by dividing the amount of the purchase payment allocated to a subaccount by the value of the corresponding accumulation unit every business day we determine the value of an accumulation unit for each subaccount by multiplying the accumulation unit value for the previous business day by the net investment factor for the current business day we determine the net investment factor by adding declared distributions daily interest dividends long term gains and short term gains for an investment option to its net asset value nav that result is then divided by the nav the end of the prior business day to determine the overall daily performance in the investment option that calculation is then multiplied by one minus the current business day s mortality and expense risk charge and any additional calendar days since the prior business day we calculate the value of each accumulation unit after regular trading on the new york stock exchange closes each business day the value of an accumulation unit may go up or down from business day to business day we calculate your separate account value by multiplying the accumulation unit value in each subaccount by the number of accumulation units for each subaccount and then adding those results together for example the contract value on any contract anniversary reflects the number and value of the accumulation units at the end of the previous business day example on wednesday we receive at our service center an additional purchase payment of  from you before the end of the business day when the new york stock exchange closes on that wednesday we determine that the value of an accumulation unit for the investment option you chose is  we then divide  by  and credit your contract on wednesday night with subaccount accumulation units for the investment option you chose if the  payment had been received at or after the end of the current business day it would have received the next business day s price   the annuity phase you can apply your contract value to regular periodic payments annuity payments a full annuitization occurs when you apply the entire contract value to annuity payments a partial annuitization occurs when you apply only part of your contract value to annuity payments the payee receives the annuity payments you receive tax reporting on the payments whether or not you are the payee we may require proof of the annuitants age before we make any life contingent annuity payment if you misstate the annuitants age or gender the amount payable is the amount that would have been provided at the true age or gender  gmib partial annuitizations are based on the gmib value and are not available until the fifth contract anniversary and they are not available if the gmib value is less than the contract value income date the income date is the date annuity payments gmib payments or traditional annuity payments begin your scheduled income date in your contract is the maximum permitted income date allowed for your contract which is the first day of the calendar month following the later of a the annuitant s th birthday or b the tenth contract anniversary your scheduled income date may be different if the contract is issued to a charitable remainder trust an earlier income date or a withdrawal may be required to satisfy minimum required distribution rules under certain qualified contracts you can make an authorized request for a different income date but any such request is subject to applicable law and our approval the extension available to you may vary depending on the financial professional you purchased your contract through and your state of residence your income date must be the first day of a calendar month and must be at least two years after the issue date some states may require us to allow you to select an earlier income date the income date cannot be later than what is permitted under applicable law to receive the annuity income protection of the gmib your income date must be within  days following a contract anniversary beginning with the fifth contract anniversary and certain other conditions must also be met your election to start annuity payments may involve an mva if any of your contract value is in a fpa on the income date note you must take a full annuitization of your total contract value on the maximum permitted income date if at that time your contract value is greater than zero we base your annuity payments on your contract value if you have not selected an annuity option we make payments under the default option described in the annuity payments discussion of this section upon full annuitization you no longer have a contract value any periodic withdrawal or payments other than annuity payments stop and the death benefit ends in addition if your contract includes the living guarantees the fpas and the guaranteed withdrawal benefit are no longer available to you and you no longer receive any true ups traditional annuity payments annuity payments offer a guaranteed income stream with certain tax advantages and are designed for owners who are not concerned with continued access to contract value you can request traditional annuity payments under annuity options  as a variable payout a fixed payout or a combination of both we base annuity payments on your contract value under a fixed payout all of the annuity payments are the same dollar amount equal installments except as provided under annuity option  guaranteed fixed traditional annuity payments are based on an interest rate and mortality table specified in your contract the payout rates for fixed traditional annuity payments provided by your contract are guaranteed and in no event do we use lower fixed payout rates to calculate your fixed traditional annuity payments however we may use higher fixed payout rates to calculate fixed traditional annuity payments than the guaranteed rates provided by your contract  view more similar documents variable annuity allianz rewards prospectus sign up to view your
