trust in fidelity and look forward to helping you achieve your financial goals what proposals am i being asked to vote on you are being asked to vote on the following proposals      to elect a board of trustees   a   to approve an amended and restated management contract between each fund and fmr co inc fmrc   b   to terminate the expense contract between each fund and fmrc  to elect a board of trustees what role does the board play the trustees serve as the fund shareholders representatives members of the board are fiduciaries and have an obligation to serve the best interests of shareholders including consideration of policy changes in addition the trustees review fund performance oversee fund activities and review contractual arrangements with companies that provide services to the funds what is the affiliation of the board and fidelity the proposed board consists of  individuals the purpose of the board is to ensure that shareholders best interests are protected in the operation of a mutual fund there is one interested trustee and  independent trustees trustees are determined to be interested by virtue of among other things their affiliation with the funds trust or various other entities under common control with fidelity management  research company fmr interested trustees are compensated by fidelity independent trustees have no affiliation with fmr and are compensated by each individual fund are board members paid each independent trustee receives a fee for his or her service on the board you can find the compensation table which details these fees in the proxy statement   a   to approve an amended and restated management contract between each fund and fmrc   b   to terminate the expense contract between each fund and fmrc why is fidelity proposing that shareholders approve an amended and restated management contract and terminate the expense contract for each fund fidelity is proposing each fund adopt an allinclusive management contract which would provide shareholders with stable and predictable expenses at lower levels than shareholders pay today we believe reducing fee levels and moving to a more simplified expense structure will provide an immediate benefit to existing shareholders increase each funds appeal to potential investors and better position the funds for future growth   if approved fidelity will replace the twopart expense structure management contract and expense contract that limits total expenses to a specified rate for each fund with an allinclusive fee management contract how will shareholders of the funds benefit from the new pricing structure under the proposal each funds allinclusive fee rate will be lower than the rate currently specified in the funds expense contract as a result overall expenses for each fund will decrease by    per year depending on the fund compared to expenses as of september   these changes would result in an estimated  million aggregate expense reduction for fund shareholders compared to the prior fiscal year has the funds board of trustees approved each proposal yes the board of trustees has unanimously approved each of the proposals and recommends that you vote to approve them who is df king  co inc df king is a third party proxy vendor that fidelity hires to call shareholders and record proxy votes in order to hold a shareholder meeting quorum must be reached if quorum is not attained the meeting may adjourn to a future date fidelity attempts to reach shareholders via multiple mailings to remind them to cast their vote as the

collectively the expense contracts which obliges fmrc to pay all classlevel expenses of each funds current share class to limit the total annual operating expenses with certain exceptions to a specified rate for each fund in an effort to increase each funds appeal to potential investors and to better position the funds for future growth fidelity is proposing to replace the twopart expense limitation structure with a more simplified allinclusive fee management contract pursuant to which fmrc will be responsible for all fundlevel and classlevel expenses of each fund with certain exceptions under the proposal each funds allinclusive fee rate will be lower than the rate currently specified in the funds expense contract which is    expected to provide an immediate benefit to existing shareholders as a result overall expenses for each fund are expected to decrease by at least  per year compared to the funds total annual operating expenses as of september   these changes would result in an estimated  million aggregate expense reduction for fund shareholders compared to the prior fiscal year to implement this new structure fidelity has proposed that each funds shareholders a adopt an amended and restated management contract with fmrc each a new advisory contract and collectively the new advisory contracts and b terminate the funds expense contract the

of the first month following approval or at a later time as fmrc may deem appropriate under the circumstances and the new advisory contracts will remain in effect through september   and thereafter but only as long as their continuance is approved at least annually by i the vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of a majority of the independent trustees and ii the vote of either a majority of the trustees or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of each fund if the new advisory contracts and termination of the expense contracts are not approved by the funds shareholders i the current advisory contracts will continue in effect through september   and thereafter only as long as their continuance is approved at least annually as above and ii the expense contracts will continue in effect so long as the current advisory contracts remain in effect approval of the new pricing structure for the funds requires that shareholders of each fund approve that funds new advisory contract and termination of that funds expense contract proposals a and b must be approved by each funds shareholders for the new advisory contracts and termination of the expense contracts to take effect for the funds if shareholders of one of the funds do not approve its new advisory contract or termination of its expense contract the current advisory contracts and expense contracts for all of the funds will remain in effect matters considered by the board at its november  meeting the current board for purposes of this section the board including the independent trustees voted to approve the new advisory contracts between fmrc and each fund to amend the management fee payable by each fund the board considered that each funds new advisory contract will not take effect unless the new advisory contracts for all of the funds are approved by the funds respective shareholders the board noted that under each funds current advisory contract the funds pay a management fee to fmrc the board considered that under each funds new advisory contract each fund will pay a monthly allinclusive management fee to fmrc at an annual rate for the fund the allinclusive fee will provide shareholders with stable and fixed expenses at a lower level than shareholders currently pay and moving to a more simplified expense structure will provide an immediate benefit to existing shareholders increase each funds appeal to potential investors and better position the funds for future growth the board considered that each funds management fee under the new advisory contract will continue to result in the funds management fee rate ranking below median of the management fee rates of its competitor funds based on the competitive mapped group data provided to the board in connection with the annual renewal of advisory contracts in september  as a result of the allinclusive management fee rates the    board noted that total expenses incurred by shareholders of each fund will decrease by at least one basis point and in some cases by up to six basis points the board considered that the approval of the new advisory contracts will not result in any changes to i the investment process or strategies employed in the management of the funds assets ii the nature extent and quality of services provided to each fund or iii the daytoday management of each fund and the personnel primarily responsible for such management the board noted that under the current advisory contracts fmrc or an affiliate undertakes to pay all operating expenses of the funds except transfer agent fees independent trustee expenses interest taxes brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses additionally each fund has entered into an expense contract that limits the total expenses of each fund the board considered that the new advisory contracts provide that fmrc or an affiliate undertakes to pay all operating expenses of the funds including transfer agent fees but excluding independent trustee expenses interest taxes brokerage commissions proxy expenses and extraordinary expenses if the new advisory contracts are approved each funds expense contract will be removed given the allinclusive structure of the new contract the board considered that under the proposal the new advisory contracts will cover all fund and classlevel expenses currently covered by the current advisory contracts and the expense contracts collectively with the exception of proxy expenses which would no longer be a contractual obligation of fmrc but would rather be evaluated on a casebycase basis in connection with its consideration of future renewals of each funds new advisory contract the funds board will consider i the nature extent and quality of services provided to the fund including shareholder and administrative services and investment performance ii the competitiveness of the funds management fee and total expenses iii the costs of the services and profitability including the revenues earned and the expenses incurred in conducting the business of developing marketing distributing managing administering and servicing the fund and its shareholders to the extent applicable and iv whether there have been economies of scale in respect of the fidelity funds whether the fidelity funds including the fund have appropriately benefited from any such economies of scale and whether there is the potential for realization of any further economies based on its evaluation of all of the conclusions noted above and after considering all factors it believed relevant the board ultimately concluded that the management fee structures are fair and reasonable and that each funds new advisory contract should be approved the board unanimously recommends that shareholders vote for each of proposals a and b if each proposal is not approved by shareholders of each fund each funds current advisory contract and expense contract will remain in effect other business the board knows of no other business to be brought before the meeting however if any other matters properly come before the meeting it is the intention that proxies that    do not contain specific instructions to the contrary will be voted on such matters in accordance with the judgment of the persons therein designated current trustees and officers of the funds abigail p

of the individual trustee or to the board of trustees at fidelity investments  summer street boston massachusetts  the current process for collecting and organizing shareholder communications requires that    the board of trustees receive copies of all communications addressed to it all communications addressed to the board of trustees or any individual trustee are logged and sent to the board or individual trustee respectively the funds do not hold annual shareholder meetings and therefore do not have a policy with regard to trustees attendance at such meetings however as a matter of practice at least one trustee attends special meetings abigail p johnson is an interested person and currently serves as chairman the trustees have determined that an interested chairman is appropriate and benefits shareholders because an interested chairman has a personal and professional stake in the quality and continuity of services provided to the funds independent trustees exercise their informed business judgment to appoint an individual of their choosing to serve as chairman regardless of whether the trustee happens to be independent or a member of management the independent trustees have determined that they can act independently and effectively without having an independent trustee serve as chairman and that a key structural component for assuring that they are in a position to do so is for the independent trustees to constitute a substantial majority for the current board the independent trustees also regularly meet in executive session marie l knowles serves as chairman of the independent trustees and as such i acts as a liaison between the independent trustees and management with respect to matters important to the independent trustees and ii with management prepares agendas for board meetings fidelity funds are overseen by different boards of trustees the funds current board oversees fidelitys investmentgrade bond money market asset allocation and certain equity funds and other boards oversee fidelitys high income sector and other equity funds the asset allocation funds may invest in fidelity funds that are overseen by such other boards the use of separate boards each with its own committee structure allows the trustees of each group of fidelity funds to focus on the unique issues of the funds they oversee including common research investment and operational issues on occasion the separate boards establish joint committees to address issues of overlapping consequences for the fidelity funds overseen by each board

security types equity securities represent an ownership interest or the right to acquire an ownership interest in an issuer different types of equity securities provide different voting and dividend rights and priority in the event of the bankruptcy of the issuer equity securities include common stocks preferred stocks convertible securities and warrants principal investment risks many factors affect each fund’s performance a fund’s share price changes daily based on changes in market conditions and interest rates and in response to other economic political or financial developments a fund’s reaction to these developments will be affected by the types of securities in which the fund invests the financial condition industry and economic sector and geographic location of an issuer and the fund’s level of investment in the securities of that issuer when a shareholder sells shares they may be worth more or less than what the shareholder paid for them which means that the shareholder could lose money the following factors can significantly affect a fund’s performance stock market volatility the value of equity securities fluctuates in response to issuer political market and economic developments in the short term equity prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to these developments different parts of the market and different types of equity securities can react differently to these developments for example large cap stocks can react differently from small cap stocks and “growth” stocks can react differently from “value” stocks issuer political or economic developments can affect a single issuer issuers within an industry or economic sector or geographic region or the market as a whole  terrorism and related geopolitical risks have led and may

exposure foreign securities foreign currencies and securities issued by us entities with substantial foreign operations can involve additional risks relating to political economic or regulatory conditions in foreign countries these risks include fluctuations in foreign currencies withholding or other taxes trading settlement custodial and other operational risks and the less stringent

us investments in addition foreign markets can perform differently from the us market issuerspecific changes changes in the financial condition of an issuer or counterparty changes in specific

shareholders by increasing costs to a fund such as brokerage commissions disrupting portfolio management strategies and diluting the value of the shares of longterm shareholders in cases in which fluctuations in markets are not fully priced into a fund’s nav accordingly the board of trustees has adopted policies and procedures designed to discourage excessive or shortterm trading of fund shares however there is the risk that the funds’ policies and procedures will prove ineffective in whole or in part to detect or prevent frequent trading a fund may alter its policies at any time without prior notice to shareholders there is no minimum holding period and shareholders can sell their shares at any time shareholders will ordinarily comply with the funds’ policies regarding excessive trading by allowing  days to pass after each investment before they sell or exchange from a fund a fund may take action if shares are held longer than  days if the trading is disruptive for other reasons such as unusually large trade size each fund reserves the right but does not have the obligation to reject any purchase or exchange transaction at any time in addition each fund reserves the right to impose restrictions on purchases or exchanges at any time or conditions that are more restrictive on disruptive excessive or shortterm trading than those that are otherwise stated in this prospectus excessive trading activity is measured by the number of roundtrip transactions in a shareholder’s account a roundtrip transaction occurs when a shareholder buys and then sells shares of a fund within  days shareholders are limited to two roundup transactions per fund within any rolling day period subject to an overall limit of four roundtrip transactions across all fidelity funds over a rolling month period transactions of  or less systematic withdrawal andor contribution programs mandatory retirement distributions and transactions initiated by a plan sponsor will not count toward the roundtrip limits for employersponsored retirement plans only participant directed exchanges will count toward the roundtrip limits shareholders with two or more roundtrip transactions in a single fund within a rolling day period will be blocked from making additional purchases or exchange purchases of the fund for  days shareholders with four or more roundtrip transactions across all fidelity funds within any rolling month period will be blocked for  days from additional purchases or exchange purchases across all fidelity funds any roundtrip within  months of the expiration of a multifund

shares to determine if the adviser’s orders comply with the fund’s frequent trading policies additions to and withdrawals from a qualified wrap program by the adviser’s clients will not be matched with transactions initiated by the adviser therefore if the adviser buys shares of a fund and an individual client subsequently sells shares of the same fund within  days the client’s transaction is not matched with the adviser’s and therefore does not count as a roundtrip however client initiated transactions are subject to a fund’s policies on frequent trading and individual clients will be subject to restrictions due to their frequent trading in a wrap account excessive trading by an adviser will lead to fund blocks and the wrap program will cease to be a qualified wrap program if the

price may be subject to greater fluctuation until the borrowing is paid off if a fund makes additional investments while borrowings are outstanding this may be considered a form of leverage           cash management a fund can hold uninvested cash or can invest it in cash equivalents such as money market securities repurchase agreements or shares of money market or shortterm bond funds generally these securities offer less potential for gains than other types of securities           central funds are special types of investment vehicles created by fidelity for use by the fidelity funds and other advisory clients central funds are used to invest in particular security types or investment disciplines or for cash management  central funds incur certain costs related to their investment activity such as custodial fees and expenses but do not pay additional management fees to fidelity the investment results of the portions of a fund’s assets invested in the central funds will be based upon the investment results of those funds            common stock represents an equity or ownership interest in an issuer in the event an issuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy the claims of owners of bonds and preferred stock take precedence over the claims of those who own common stock           convertible securities are bonds debentures notes or other securities that may be converted or exchanged by the holder or by the issuer into shares of the underlying common stock or cash or securities of equivalent value at a stated exchange ratio a convertible security may also be called for redemption or conversion by the issuer after a particular date and under certain circumstances including a specified price established upon issue if a convertible security held by a fund is called for redemption or conversion the fund could be required to tender it for redemption convert it into the underlying common stock or sell it to a third party  pnaath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th           convertible securities generally have less potential for gain or loss than common stocks convertible securities generally provide yields higher than the underlying common stocks but generally lower than comparable nonconvertible securities because of this higher yield convertible securities generally sell at prices above their “conversion value” which is the current market value of the stock to be received upon conversion the difference between this conversion value and the price of convertible securities will vary over time depending on changes in the value of the underlying common stocks and interest rates when the underlying common stocks decline in value convertible securities will tend not to decline to the same extent because of the interest or dividend payments and the repayment of principal at maturity for certain types of convertible securities however securities that are convertible other than at the option of the holder generally do not limit the potential for loss to the same extent as securities convertible at the option of the holder when the underlying common stocks rise in value the value of convertible securities may also be expected to increase at the same time however the difference between the market value of convertible securities and their conversion value will narrow which means that the value of convertible securities will generally not increase to the same extent as the value of the underlying common stocks because convertible securities may also be interestrate sensitive their value may increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise convertible securities are also subject to credit risk and are often lowerquality securities           debt securities are used by issuers to borrow money the issuer usually pays a fixed variable or floating rate of interest and must repay the amount borrowed usually at the maturity of the security some debt securities such as zero coupon bonds do not pay interest but are sold at a deep discount from their face values debt securities include corporate bonds government securities repurchase agreements and mortgage and other assetbacked securities           exposure to foreign markets foreign securities foreign currencies and securities issued by us entities with substantial foreign operations may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in us investments           foreign investments involve risks relating to local political economic regulatory or social instability military action or unrest or adverse diplomatic developments and may be affected by actions of foreign governments adverse to the interests of us investors such actions may include expropriation or nationalization of assets confiscatory taxation restrictions on us investment or on the ability to repatriate assets or convert currency into us dollars or other government intervention there is no assurance that geode will be able to anticipate these potential events or counter their effects in addition the value of securities denominated in foreign currencies and of dividends and interest paid with respect to such securities will fluctuate based on the relative strength of the us dollar           it is anticipated that in most cases the best available market for foreign securities will be on an exchange or in overthecounter otc markets located outside of the united states foreign stock markets while growing in volume and sophistication are generally not as developed as those in the united states and securities of some foreign issuers may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable us issuers foreign security trading settlement and custodial practices including those involving securities settlement where fund assets may be released prior to receipt of payment are often less developed than those in us markets and may result in increased risk or substantial delays in the event of a failed trade or the insolvency of or breach of duty by a foreign brokerdealer securities depository or foreign subcustodian in addition the costs associated with foreign investments including withholding taxes brokerage commissions and custodial costs are generally higher than with us investments           foreign markets may offer less protection to investors than us markets foreign issuers are generally not bound by uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting requirements and standards of practice comparable to those applicable to us issuers adequate public information on foreign issuers may not be available and it may be difficult to secure dividends and information regarding corporate actions on a timely basis in general there is less overall governmental supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and listed companies than in the united states otc markets tend to be less regulated than stock exchange markets and in certain countries may be totally unregulated regulatory enforcement may be influenced by economic or political concerns and investors may have difficulty enforcing their legal rights in foreign countries           some foreign securities impose restrictions on transfer within the united states or to us persons although securities subject to such transfer restrictions may be marketable abroad they may be less liquid than foreign securities of the same class that are not subject to such restrictions  pnaath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th           american depositary receipts adrs as well as other “hybrid” forms of adrs including european depositary receipts edrs and global depositary receipts gdrs are certificates evidencing ownership of shares of a foreign issuer these certificates are issued by depository banks and generally trade on an established market in the united states or elsewhere the underlying shares are held in trust by a custodian bank or similar financial institution in the issuer’s home country the depository bank may not have physical custody of the underlying securities at all times and may charge fees for various services including forwarding dividends and interest and corporate actions adrs are alternatives to directly purchasing the underlying foreign securities in their national markets and currencies however adrs continue to be subject to many of the risks associated with investing directly in foreign securities these risks include foreign exchange risk as well as the political and economic risks of the underlying issuer’s country           the risks of foreign investing may be magnified for investments in emerging markets security prices in emerging markets can be significantly more volatile than those in more developed markets reflecting the greater uncertainties of investing in less established markets and economies in particular countries with emerging markets may have relatively unstable governments may present the risks of nationalization of businesses restrictions on foreign ownership and prohibitions on the repatriation of assets and may have less protection of property rights than more developed countries the economies of countries with emerging markets may be based on only a few industries may be highly vulnerable to changes in local or global trade conditions and may suffer from extreme and volatile debt burdens or inflation rates local securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to increases in trading volume potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times           foreign currency transactions a fund may conduct foreign currency transactions on a spot ie cash or forward basis ie by entering into forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies although foreign exchange dealers generally do not charge a fee for such conversions they do realize a profit based on the difference between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the counterparty desire to resell that currency to the dealer forward contracts are customized transactions that require a specific amount of a currency to be delivered at a specific exchange rate on a specific date or range of dates in the future forward contracts are generally traded in an interbank market directly between currency traders usually large commercial banks and their customers the parties to a forward contract may agree to offset or terminate the contract before its maturity or may hold the contract to maturity and complete the contemplated currency exchange           the following discussion summarizes the principal currency management strategies involving forward contracts that could be used by a fund a fund may also use swap agreements indexed securities and options and futures contracts relating to foreign currencies for the same purposes           a “settlement hedge” or “transaction hedge” is designed to protect a fund against an adverse change in foreign currency values between the date a security is purchased or sold and the date on which payment is made or received entering into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of the amount of foreign currency involved in an underlying security transaction for a fixed amount of us dollars “locks in” the us dollar price of the security forward contracts to purchase or sell a foreign currency may also be used by a fund in anticipation of future purchases or sales of securities denominated in foreign currency even if the specific investments have not yet been selected by geode           a fund may also use forward contracts to hedge against a decline in the value of existing investments denominated in foreign currency for example if a fund owned securities denominated in pounds sterling it could enter into a forward contract to sell pounds sterling in return for us dollars to hedge against possible declines in the pound’s value such a hedge sometimes referred to as a “position hedge” would tend to offset both positive and negative currency fluctuations but would not offset changes in security values caused by other factors a fund could also hedge the position by selling another currency expected to perform similarly to the pound sterling this type of hedge sometimes referred to as a “proxy hedge” could offer advantages in terms of cost yield or efficiency but generally would not hedge currency exposure as effectively as a direct hedge into us dollars proxy hedges may result in losses if the currency used to hedge does not perform similarly to the currency in which the hedged securities are denominated           a fund may enter into forward contracts to shift its investment exposure from one currency into another this may include shifting exposure from us dollars to a foreign currency or from one foreign currency to another foreign currency this type of strategy sometimes known as a “crosshedge” will tend to reduce or eliminate  pnaath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th exposure to the currency that is sold and increase exposure to the currency that is purchased much as if a fund had sold a security denominated in one currency and purchased an equivalent security denominated in another crosshedges protect against losses resulting from a decline in the hedged currency but will cause a fund to assume the risk of fluctuations in the value of the currency it purchases           successful use of currency management strategies will depend on geode’s skill in analyzing currency values currency management strategies may substantially change a fund’s investment exposure to changes in currency exchange rates and could result in losses to a fund if currencies do not perform as geode anticipates for example if a currency’s value rose at a time when geode had hedged a fund by selling that currency in exchange for dollars a fund would not participate in the currency’s appreciation if geode hedges currency exposure through proxy hedges a fund could realize currency losses from both the hedge and the security position if the two currencies do not move in tandem similarly if geode increases a fund’s exposure to a foreign currency and that currency’s value declines a fund will realize a loss there is no assurance that geode’s use of currency management strategies will be advantageous to a fund or that it will hedge at appropriate times           funds’ rights as an investor the funds do not intend to direct or administer the daytoday operations of any company a fund however may exercise its rights as a shareholder or lender and may communicate its views on important matters of policy to management the board of directors shareholders of a company and holders of other securities of the company when geode determines that such matters could have a significant effect on the value of the fund’s investment in the company the activities in which a fund may engage either individually or in conjunction with others may include among others supporting or opposing proposed changes in a company’s corporate structure or business activities seeking changes in a company’s directors or management seeking changes in a company’s direction or policies seeking the sale or reorganization of the company or a portion of its assets supporting or opposing thirdparty takeover efforts supporting the filing of a bankruptcy petition or foreclosing on collateral securing a security this area of corporate activity is increasingly prone to litigation and it is possible that a fund could be involved in lawsuits related to such activities geode will monitor such activities with a view to mitigating to the extent possible the risk of litigation against a fund and the risk of actual liability if a fund is involved in litigation no guarantee can be made however that litigation against a fund will not be undertaken or liabilities incurred the funds’ proxy voting guidelines are included in this sai           futures options and swaps the following paragraphs pertain to futures options and swaps combined positions correlation of price changes futures contracts futures margin payments limitations on futures options and swap transactions liquidity of options and futures contracts options and futures on foreign currencies otc options purchasing put and call options writing put and call options and swap agreements           combined positions involve purchasing and writing options in combination with each other or in combination with futures or forward contracts to adjust the risk and return characteristics of the overall position for example purchasing a put option and writing a call option on the same underlying instrument would construct a combined position whose risk and return characteristics are similar to selling a futures contract another possible combined position would involve writing a call option at one strike price and buying a call option at a lower price to reduce the risk of the written call option in the event of a substantial price increase because combined options positions involve multiple trades they result in higher transaction costs and may be more difficult to open and close out           correlation of price changes because there are a limited number of types of exchangetraded options and futures contracts it is likely that the standardized contracts available will not match a fund’s current or anticipated investments exactly a fund may invest in options and futures contracts based on securities with different issuers maturities or other characteristics from the securities in which the fund typically invests which involves a risk that the options or futures position will not track the performance of the fund’s other investments           options and futures prices can also diverge from the prices of their underlying instruments even if the underlying instruments match a fund’s investments well options and futures prices are affected by such factors as current and anticipated shortterm interest rates changes in volatility of the underlying instrument and the time remaining until expiration of the contract which may not affect security prices the same way imperfect correlation may also result from differing levels of demand in the options and futures markets and the securities markets from structural differences in how options and futures and securities are traded or from imposition of daily price fluctuation limits or trading halts a fund may purchase or sell options and futures contracts with a greater or lesser value than the securities it wishes to hedge or intends to purchase in order to attempt to compensate for differences in volatility between the contract and the securities although this may not be successful in all cases if price changes in a fund’s options or futures positions are poorly correlated with its other investments the positions may fail to produce anticipated gains or result in losses that are not offset by gains in other investments  pnaath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th           futures contracts in purchasing a futures contract the buyer agrees to purchase a specified underlying instrument at a specified future date in selling a futures contract the seller agrees to sell a specified underlying instrument at a specified future date the price at which the purchase and sale will take place is fixed when the buyer and seller enter into the contract some currently available futures contracts are based on specific securities such as us treasury bonds or notes and some are based on indices of securities prices such as the sp  futures can be held until their delivery dates or can be closed out before then if a liquid secondary market is available           futures may be based on foreign indexes such as the compagnie des agents de change  index cac  in france the deutscher aktienindex dax  in germany the financial times stock exchange eurotop  index ftse eurotop  in europe the ibex  index ibex  in spain the financial times stock exchange  index ftse  in the united kingdom the australian stock exchange all ordinaries index asx all ordinaries in australia the hang seng index in hong kong and the nikkei stock average nikkei  the nikkei stock index  nikkei  and the tokyo stock exchange stock price index topix in japan           the value of a futures contract tends to increase and decrease in tandem with the value of its underlying instrument therefore purchasing futures contracts will tend to increase a fund’s exposure to positive and negative price fluctuations in the underlying instrument much as if it had purchased the underlying instrument directly when a fund sells a futures contract by contrast the value of its futures position will tend to move in a direction contrary to the market selling futures contracts therefore will tend to offset both positive and negative market price changes much as if the underlying instrument had been sold           futures margin payments the purchaser or seller of a futures contract is not required to deliver or pay for the underlying instrument unless the contract is held until the delivery date however both the purchaser and seller are required to deposit “initial margin” with a futures broker known as a futures commission merchant fcm when the contract is entered into initial margin deposits are typically equal to a percentage of the contract’s value if the value of either party’s position declines that party will be required to make additional “variation margin” payments to settle the change in value on a daily basis the party that has a gain may be entitled to receive all or a portion of this amount initial and variation margin payments do not constitute purchasing securities on margin for purposes of a fund’s investment limitations in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of an fcm that holds margin on behalf of a fund the fund may be entitled to return of margin owed to it only in proportion to the amount received by the fcm’s other customers potentially resulting in losses to the fund a fund is required to segregate liquid assets equivalent to the fund’s outstanding obligations under the contract in excess of the initial margin and variation margin if any           limitations on futures options and swap transactions the trust on behalf of each fund has filed with the national futures association a notice claiming an exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” cpo under the commodity exchange act as amended and the rules of the commodity futures trading commission promulgated thereunder with respect to the fund’s operation accordingly the fund is not subject to registration or regulation as a cpo           geode also intends to follow certain other limitations on each fund’s futures and option activities each fund will not purchase any option if as a result more than  of its total assets would be invested in option premiums under normal conditions each fund will not enter into any futures contract option or swap agreement if as a result the sum of i the current value of assets hedged in the case of strategies involving the sale of securities and ii the current value of the indices or other instruments underlying the fund’s other futures options or swaps positions would exceed  of the fund’s total assets these limitations do not apply to options attached to or acquired or traded together with their underlying securities and do not apply to securities that incorporate features similar to futures options or swaps           the above limitations on the funds’ investments in futures contracts options and swaps and the funds’ policies regarding futures contracts options and swaps discussed elsewhere in this sai may be changed as regulatory agencies permit           liquidity of options and futures contracts there is no assurance a liquid secondary market will exist for any particular options or futures contract at any particular time options may have relatively low trading volume and liquidity if their strike prices are not close to the underlying instrument’s current price in addition exchanges may  pnaath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th establish daily price fluctuation limits for options and futures contracts and may halt trading if a contract’s price moves upward or downward more than the limit in a given day on volatile trading days when the price fluctuation limit is reached or a trading halt is imposed it may be impossible to enter into new positions or close out existing positions if the secondary market for a contract is not liquid because of price fluctuation limits or otherwise it could prevent prompt liquidation of unfavorable positions and potentially could require a fund to continue to hold a position until delivery or expiration regardless of changes in its value as a result a fund’s access to other assets held to cover its options or futures positions could also be impaired           options and futures relating to foreign currencies currency futures contracts are similar to forward currency exchange contracts except that they are traded on exchanges and have margin requirements and are standardized as to contract size and delivery date most currency futures contracts call for payment or delivery in us dollars the underlying instrument of a currency option may be a foreign currency which generally is purchased or delivered in exchange for us dollars or may be a futures contract the purchaser of a currency call obtains the right to purchase the underlying currency and the purchaser of a currency put obtains the right to sell the underlying currency           the uses and risks of currency options and futures are similar to options and futures relating to securities or indices as discussed above a fund may purchase and sell currency futures and may purchase and write currency options to increase or decrease its exposure to different foreign currencies currency options may also be purchased or written in conjunction with each other or with currency futures or forward contracts currency futures and options values can be expected to correlate with exchange rates but may not reflect other factors that affect the value of a fund’s investments a currency hedge for example should protect a yendenominated security from a decline in the yen but will not protect a fund against a price decline resulting from deterioration in the issuer’s creditworthiness because the value of a fund’s foreigndenominated investments changes in response to many factors other than exchange rates it may not be possible to match the amount of currency options and futures to the value of the fund’s investments exactly over time           otc options unlike exchangetraded options which are standardized with respect to the underlying instrument expiration date contract size and strike price the terms of otc options options not traded on exchanges generally are established through negotiation with the other party to the option contract while this type of arrangement allows the purchaser or writer greater flexibility to tailor an option to its needs otc options generally are less liquid and involve greater credit risk than exchangetraded options which are guaranteed by the clearing organization of the exchanges where they are traded           purchasing put and call options by purchasing a put option the purchaser obtains the right but not the obligation to sell the option’s underlying instrument at a fixed strike price in return for this right the purchaser pays the current market price for the option known as the option premium options have various types of underlying instruments including specific securities indices of securities prices and futures contracts the purchaser may terminate its position in a put option by allowing it to expire or by exercising the option if the option is allowed to expire the purchaser will lose the entire premium if the option is exercised the purchaser completes the sale of the underlying instrument at the strike price a purchaser may also terminate a put option position by closing it out in the secondary market at its current price if a liquid secondary market exists           the buyer of a typical put option can expect to realize a gain if security prices fall substantially however if the underlying instrument’s price does not fall enough to offset the cost of purchasing the option a put buyer can expect to suffer a loss limited to the amount of the premium plus related transaction costs           the features of call options are essentially the same as those of put options except that the purchaser of a call option obtains the right to purchase rather than sell the underlying instrument at the option’s strike price a call buyer typically attempts to participate in potential price increases of the underlying instrument with risk limited to the cost of the option if security prices fall at the same time the buyer can expect to suffer a loss if security prices do not rise sufficiently to offset the cost of the option           writing put and call options the writer of a put or call option takes the opposite side of the transaction from the option’s purchaser in return for receipt of the premium the writer assumes the obligation to pay the strike price for the option’s underlying instrument if the other party to the option chooses to exercise it the writer may seek to terminate a position in a put option before exercise by closing out the option in the secondary market at its current price if the secondary market is not liquid for a put option however the writer must continue to be prepared to pay the strike price while the option is outstanding regardless of price changes when writing an option on a futures contract a fund will be required to make margin payments to an fcm as described above for futures contracts  pnaast page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st           if security prices rise a put writer would generally expect to profit although its gain would be limited to the amount of the premium it received if security prices remain the same over time it is likely that the writer will also profit because it should be able to close out the option at a lower price if security prices fall the put writer would expect to suffer a loss this loss should be less than the loss from purchasing the underlying instrument directly however because the premium received for writing the option should mitigate the effects of the decline           writing a call option obligates the writer to sell or deliver the option’s underlying instrument in return for the strike price upon exercise of the option the characteristics of writing call options are similar to those of writing put options except that writing calls generally is a profitable strategy if prices remain the same or fall through receipt of the option premium a call writer mitigates the effects of a price decline at the same time because a call writer must be prepared to deliver the underlying instrument in return for the strike price even if its current value is greater a call writer gives up some ability to participate in security price increases           swap agreements can be individually negotiated and structured to include exposure to a variety of different types of investments or market factors depending on their structure swap agreements may increase or decrease a fund’s exposure to long or shortterm interest rates in the united states or abroad foreign currency values mortgage securities corporate borrowing rates or other factors such as security prices or inflation rates swap agreements can take many different forms and are known by a variety of names           in a typical cap or floor agreement one party agrees to make payments only under specified circumstances usually in return for payment of a fee by the other party for example the buyer of an interest rate cap obtains the right to receive payments to the extent that a specified interest rate exceeds an agreedupon level while the seller of an interest rate floor is obligated to make payments to the extent that a specified interest rate falls below an agreedupon level an interest rate collar combines elements of buying a cap and selling a floor           swap agreements will tend to shift a fund’s investment exposure from one type of investment to another for example if the fund agreed to exchange payments in dollars for payments in foreign currency the swap agreement would tend to decrease the fund’s exposure to us interest rates and increase its exposure to foreign currency and interest rates caps and floors have an effect similar to buying or writing options depending on how they are used swap agreements may increase or decrease the overall volatility of a fund’s investments and its share price           swap agreements also may allow a fund to acquire or reduce credit exposure to a particular issuer the most significant factor in the performance of swap agreements is the change in the factors that determine the amounts of payments due to and from a fund if a swap agreement calls for payments by the fund the fund must be prepared to make such payments when due if a swap counterparty’s creditworthiness declines the risk that they may not perform may increase potentially resulting in a loss to the fund although there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to do so the fund may be able to reduce or eliminate its exposure under a swap agreement either by assignment or other disposition or by entering into an offsetting swap agreement with the same party or a similarly creditworthy party           illiquid securities cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at

determining the liquidity of a fund’s investments various factors may be considered including  the frequency and volume of trades and quotations  the number of dealers and prospective purchasers in the marketplace  dealer undertakings to make a market and  the nature of the security and the market in which it trades including any demand put or tender features the mechanics and other requirements

other financial indicators indexed securities typically but not always are debt securities or deposits whose value at maturity or coupon rate is determined by reference to a specific instrument or

maturity value may decline when foreign currencies increase resulting in a security whose price characteristics are similar to a put on the underlying currency currencyindexed securities may also have prices that depend on the values of a number of different foreign currencies relative to each other           the performance of indexed securities depends to a great extent on the performance of the security currency or other instrument to which they are indexed and may also be influenced by interest rate changes in the united states and abroad indexed securities may be more volatile than the

borrower’s obligation or that the collateral could be liquidated indebtedness of borrowers whose creditworthiness is poor involves substantially greater risks and may be highly speculative borrowers

          investments in loans through direct assignment of a financial institution’s interests with respect to a loan may involve additional risks for example if a loan is foreclosed the purchaser could become part owner of any collateral and would bear the costs and liabilities associated with owning and disposing of the collateral in addition it is conceivable that under emerging legal theories of lender liability a purchaser could be held liable as a colender direct debt instruments may also involve a risk of insolvency of the lending bank or other intermediary           a loan is often administered by a bank or other financial institution that acts as agent for all holders the agent administers the terms of the loan as specified in the loan agreement unless under the terms of the loan or other indebtedness the purchaser has direct recourse against the borrower the purchaser may have to rely on the agent to apply appropriate credit remedies against a borrower if assets held by the agent for the benefit of a purchaser were determined to be subject to the claims of the agent’s general creditors the purchaser might incur certain costs and delays in realizing payment on the loan or loan participation and could suffer a loss of principal or interest           direct indebtedness may include letters of credit revolving credit facilities or other standby financing commitments that obligate purchasers to make additional cash payments on demand these commitments may have the effect of requiring a purchaser to increase its investment in a borrower at a time when it would not otherwise have done so even if the borrower’s condition makes it unlikely that the amount will ever be repaid           each fund limits the amount of total assets that it will invest in any one issuer or in issuers within the same industry see each fund’s investment limitations for purposes of these limitations a fund generally will treat the borrower as the “issuer” of indebtedness held by the fund in the case of loan participations where a bank or other lending institution serves as financial intermediary between a fund and the borrower if the participation does not shift to the fund the direct debtorcreditor relationship with the borrower sec interpretations require a fund in appropriate circumstances to treat both the lending bank or other lending institution and the borrower as “issuers” for these purposes treating a financial intermediary as an issuer of indebtedness may restrict a fund’s ability to invest in indebtedness related to a single financial intermediary or a group of intermediaries engaged in the same industry even if the underlying borrowers represent many different companies and industries           lowerquality debt securities lowerquality debt securities include all types of debt instruments that have poor protection with respect to the payment of interest and repayment of principal or may be in default these securities are often considered to be speculative and involve greater risk of loss or price changes due to changes in the issuer’s capacity to pay the market prices of lowerquality debt securities may fluctuate more than those of higherquality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty which may follow periods of rising interest rates           the market for lowerquality debt securities may be thinner and less active than that for higherquality debt securities which can adversely affect the prices at which the former are sold adverse publicity and changing investor perceptions may affect the liquidity of lowerquality debt securities and the ability of outside pricing services to value lowerquality debt securities           a fund may choose at

selfliquidation and the possibility of failing to qualify for taxfree status of income under the internal revenue code and failing to maintain exemption from the  act           repurchase agreements involve an agreement to purchase a security and to sell that security back to the original seller at an agreedupon price the resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreedupon incremental

agreement defaults or becomes insolvent the funds will engage in repurchase agreement transactions with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by geode or under certain circumstances by strategic advisers or a strategic advisers affiliate           restricted securities are subject to legal restrictions on their sale difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or be costly to a fund restricted securities generally can be sold in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of   act or in a registered public offering where registration is required the holder of a registered security may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expense and a considerable period may elapse between the time it decides to seek registration and the time it may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement if during such a period adverse market conditions were to develop the holder might obtain a less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to seek registration of the security           reverse repurchase agreements in a reverse repurchase agreement a fund sells a security to another party such as a bank or brokerdealer in return for cash and agrees to repurchase that security at an agreedupon price and time the funds will enter into reverse repurchase agreements with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by geode or under certain circumstances by strategic advisers or a strategic advisers affiliate such

fund with collateral in an amount at least equal to the value of the securities loaned the fund seeks to maintain the ability to obtain the right to vote or consent on proxy proposals involving material events affecting securities loaned if the borrower defaults on its obligation to return the securities loaned because of insolvency or other reasons a fund could experience delays and costs in recovering the securities loaned or in gaining access to the collateral these delays and costs could be greater for foreign securities if a fund is not able to recover the securities loaned a fund may sell the collateral and purchase a replacement investment in the market the value of the collateral could decrease below the value of the replacement investment by the time the replacement investment is purchased loans will be made only to parties deemed by strategic advisers or an affiliate to be in good standing and when in strategic advisers’ or an affiliates’ judgment the income earned would justify the risks           cash received as collateral through loan transactions may be invested in other eligible securities including shares of a money market fund investing this cash

stocks and investmentgrade debt instruments for temporary defensive purposes           warrants warrants are instruments which entitle the holder to buy an equity security at a specific price for a specific period of time changes in the value of a warrant do not necessarily correspond to changes in the value of its underlying security the price of a warrant may be more volatile than the price of its underlying security and a warrant may offer greater potential for capital appreciation as well as capital loss           warrants do not entitle a holder to dividends or voting rights with respect to the underlying security and do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuing company a warrant ceases to have value if it is not exercised prior to its expiration date these factors can make warrants more speculative than other types of investments           zero coupon bonds do not make interest payments instead they are sold at a discount from their face value and are redeemed at

managed by strategic advisers or geode or their affiliates the same security is often held in the portfolio of more than one of these funds or investment accounts simultaneous transactions are inevitable when several funds and investment accounts are managed by the same investment adviser particularly when the same security is suitable for the investment objective of more than one fund or investment account           when two or more funds or investment accounts are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of the same security including a futures contract the prices and amounts are allocated in accordance with procedures believed to be appropriate and equitable to each fund or investment account in some cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or value of the security as far as the funds are concerned in other cases however the ability of the funds to participate in volume transactions will produce better executions and prices for the funds           orders for funds and investment accounts are not typically combined or blocked however geode may when feasible and when consistent with the fair and equitable treatment of all funds and investment accounts and best execution block orders of various funds and investment accounts for order entry and execution           geode has established allocation policies for its various funds and investment accounts to ensure allocations are appropriate given its clients differing investment objectives and other considerations when the supplydemand is insufficient to satisfy all outstanding trade orders generally the amount executed is distributed among participating funds and investment accounts based on account asset size for purchases and naked short sales and security position size for sales or otherwise according to the allocation policies these policies also apply to initial public and secondary offerings generally allocations are determined by traders independent of portfolio managers in accordance with these policies allocations are determined and documented on trade date           geode’s trade allocation policies identify circumstances under which it is appropriate to deviate from the general allocation criteria and describe the alternative procedures for example if a standard allocation would result in a fund or investment account receiving a very small allocation eg because of its small asset size the fund or investment account may receive an increased allocation to achieve a more meaningful allocation or it may receive no allocation generally any exceptions to geode’s policies ie special allocations must be approved by senior investment or trading personnel reviewed by the compliance department and documented           commissions paid           a fund

contracts due to exchange rate fluctuations and days to maturity are included in the calculation of nav if an event that is expected to materially affect the value of a portfolio security occurs after the close of an exchange or market on which that security is traded then that security will be valued in good faith by a committee appointed by the board of trustees           shortterm securities

foreign governments may also impose taxes on other payments or gains with respect to foreign securities because each fund does not currently anticipate that securities of foreign issuers will

geode takes seriously its responsibility to monitor corporate events affecting securities in those client accounts and to exercise its voting authority with respect to those securities in the best interests of its clients including shareholders of mutual funds for which it serves as adviser or subadviser the purposes of these proxy voting policies are  to establish a framework for geode’s analysis and decisionmaking with respect to proxy voting and  to set forth operational procedures for geode’s exercise of proxy voting authority overview           geode applies the same voting decision for all accounts in which it exercises voting authority and seeks in all cases to vote in a manner that geode believes represents the best interests of its clients including shareholders of mutual funds for which it serves as adviser or subadviser geode anticipates that based on its current business model it will manage the vast majority of assets under its management using passive investment management techniques such as indexing geode manages private funds and separate accounts using active investment management techniques primarily employing quantitative investment strategies           geode has established an operations committee consisting of senior officers and investment professionals including but not limited to geode’s president chief operating officer “coo” chief compliance officer “cco” and compliance manager members of the operations committee oversee the exercise of voting authority under these proxy voting policies consulting with geode’s legal counsel with respect to controversial matters and for interpretive and other guidance geode will engage an established commercial proxy advisory service the “agent” for comprehensive analysis research and voting recommendations particularly for matters that may be controversial present potential conflicts of interest or require casebycase analysis under these guidelines geode has directed the agent to employ the policies set forth below together with more specific guidelines and instructions set forth in a detailed customized questionnaire developed jointly by geode and the agent to formulate recommended votes on each matter geode may determine to accept or reject any recommendation based on the research and analysis provided by the agent or on any independent research and analysis obtained or generated by geode however because the recommended votes are determined solely based on the customized policies established by geode geode expects that the recommendations will be followed in most cases the agent also acts as a proxy voting agent to effect the votes and maintain records of all of geode’s proxy votes in all cases the ultimate voting decision and responsibility rests with the members of the operations committee who are accountable to geode’s clients including shareholders of mutual funds for which it serves as adviser or subadviser policies           as a general matter  proxies will be voted for incumbent members of a board of directors and for routine management proposals except as otherwise addressed under these policies  shareholder and nonroutine management proposals addressed by these policies will be voted as provided in these policies  shareholder and nonroutine management proposals not addressed by these policies will be evaluated by the members of geode’s operations committee based on fundamental analysis andor research and recommendations provided by the agent and the members of the operations committee shall make the voting decision and  all proxy votes shall be considered and made in a manner consistent with the best interests of geode’s clients including shareholders of mutual fund clients without regard to any other relationship business or otherwise between the portfolio company subject to the proxy vote and geode or its affiliates           due to its focused business model and the number of investments that geode will make for its clients particularly pursuant to its indexing strategy geode does not anticipate that actual or potential conflicts of interest are likely to occur in the ordinary course of its business however geode believes it is essential to avoid having conflicts of interest affect its objective of voting in the best interests of its clients therefore in the event that members of the operations committee the agent or any other person involved in the analysis or voting of proxies has knowledge of or has reason to believe there may exist any potential relationship business or otherwise between the portfolio company subject to the proxy vote and geode and any subsidiary of geode or their respective directors officers employees or agents such person shall notify other members of the operations committee and may consult with outside counsel to geode to analyze and address such potential conflict of interest in the case of an actual conflict of interest on the advice of counsel geode expects that the independent directors of  pnaath page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th geode will consider the matter and may  determine that there is no conflict of interest or that reasonable measures have been taken to remedy or avoid any conflict of interest that would prevent geode from voting the applicable proxy  acting as independent directors using such information as is available from the agent vote the applicable proxy or  cause authority to delegated to the agent or a similar special fiduciary to vote the applicable proxy           geode has established the specific proxy voting policies that are summarized below to maximize the value of investments in its clients’ accounts which it believes will be furthered through  accountability of a company’s management and directors to its shareholders  alignment of the interests of management with those of shareholders including through compensation benefit and equity ownership programs and  increased disclosure of a company’s business and operations geode reserves the right to override any of its proxy voting policies with respect to a particular shareholder vote when such an override is in geode’s best judgment consistent with the overall principle of voting proxies in the best longterm economic interest of geode’s clients geode’s specific policies are as follows

express disclaimer of shareholder liability for the debts liabilities obligations and expenses of the trust the trust instrument provides that the trust shall not have any claim against shareholders except for the payment of the purchase price of shares and requires that each agreement obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the trust or the trustees relating to the trust shall include a provision limiting the obligations created thereby to the trust or one or more funds and its or their assets the trust instrument further provides that shareholders of a fund shall not have a claim on or right to any assets belonging to any other fund           the trust instrument provides for indemnification out of each fund’s property of any shareholder or former shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the fund solely by reason of his or her being or having been a shareholder and not because of his or her acts or omissions or for some other reason the trust instrument also provides that each fund shall upon request assume the defense of any claim made against any shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund and satisfy any judgment thereon thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which delaware law does not apply no contractual limitation of liability was in effect and a fund is unable to meet its obligations strategic advisers believes that in view of the above the risk of personal liability to shareholders is extremely remote
