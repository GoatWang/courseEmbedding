services employer securities litigation settlements investment management annuities plan administration compliance and consulting resources case studies articles  presentations company brochures contact us location services employer securities litigation settlements investment management annuities plan administration compliance and consulting annuities overview the purchase of annuities can be used to settle some or all of a defined benefit plan’s benefit obligations when a plan sponsor concludes settling the obligations is an appropriate way to address the obligations and related impacts on the plan sponsor’s balance sheet the decision to settle pension obligations is a nonfiduciary decision of the plan sponsor while the selection of the insurer or insurers and the contract structure is a fiduciary decision in a plan termination the purchase of annuities satisfies all of the plan’s benefit obligations as the insurance carrier assumes responsibility for all liabilities in other instances the purchase of annuities can be used to settle the benefits for a subset of plan participants such as current retirees in a spinoff termination assets and liabilities for the participants to be annuitized are spun off then the spunoff plan is terminated and annuities are purchased  in an annuity buyout there is no termination but the plan purchases annuities for a subset of participants and transfers all related obligations to the insurer it is also possible for a plan to invest in an annuity contract while retaining the obligation to pay participants an annuity buyin but this has been less prevalent of late since the primary driver of annuitization has been the desire of plan sponsors to settle pension liabilities in any case the selection of an annuity provider in connection with benefit distributions is a fiduciary act governed by the fiduciary standards of section a of erisa including the duty to act prudently and solely in the interest of the plan’s participants and beneficiaries the department of labor in its interpretive bulletin  “ib ” provides that plan fiduciaries must take steps calculated to obtain the safest available annuity and must conduct an objective thorough and analytical search for purposes of identifying providers from which to purchase annuities it goes on to set forth six factors that should be considered by fiduciaries in evaluating a potential provider’s claims paying ability and creditworthiness ib  emphasizes that the selection must be made in the interest of participants not the plan sponsor although some courts have said the purchase of the safest available annuity may not be necessary they still have emphasized that fiduciaries must act in the interest of participants and prevent conflicting interests from entering the decisionmaking process congress amended erisa to make clear that the safest available annuity standard does not apply to annuity purchases made available to participants in defined contribution plans the dol has issued separate guidance for those plans what we do fiduciary counselors assumes full fiduciary responsibility for the selection of an insurance carriers to provide the annuity delegating full fiduciary responsibility to an independent fiduciary is intended to remove any real or perceived conflict of interest and show the selection was indeed completed in a manner that protects the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries and is consistent with dol guidance on this matter as independent fiduciary benefit security is of paramount importance in all situations however the size of the annuity purchase will ultimately determine whether a potential insurer will entertain certain features such as a separate account and whether transaction specific documents will be negotiated a smaller transaction would most likely use a standard annuity agreement while for the larger transaction a complex definitive purchase agreement and group annuity contract would be negotiated for that single transaction in any case fiduciary counselors working with experts in the insurance industry will analyze the available options represent the interests of plan participants ensure compliance with the fiduciary standards of erisa and make a determination that the annuity selection is consistent with the dol guidance found in ib  experience we have served as the independent fiduciary for eleven annuity purchases totaling approximately  billion for plans including –        verizon  billion –        bristolmyers squibb  billion –        jcpenney –        visteon  million –        enron  million in  in addition to jcpenney we have served as independent fiduciary for three annuity purchases totaling  billion our experience covers annuity purchases smaller than those listed including purchases below  million we are highly qualified to handle annuity purchases of any size next steps fiduciary counselors has experience in ensuring that the placement of annuities is handled in a manner consistent with the applicable provisions of erisa and the guidance of the dol’s ib  we welcome the opportunity to discuss any situation in greater detail

investment management annuities plan administration compliance and consulting plan administration overview there are a number of situations where an independent plan administrator may be required to manage the ongoing operation of a plan company operations may cease as a result of bankruptcy or financial distress and can leave the benefit plans without a plan sponsor fiduciary counselors can act as the plan administrator and named fiduciary for plans in these situations we have fulfilled this role in a number of cases most recently for the enron corp savings plan and for four plans maintained by plan sponsors in the revstone industries controlled group often we have been responsible for the orderly wind up of the plan’s affairs including final distributions to plan participants and beneficiaries in addition to serving as the plan administrator for plans with troubled or absent sponsors fiduciary counselors can step into the role of independent fiduciary for nonqualified plans such as severance plans or other supplemental plans often the responsibilities of an independent third party are specified under the terms of a plan or trust what we do fiduciary counselors is capable of stepping into the role of plan administrator and assuming responsibility for overseeing the investment of plan assets manage plan service providers and oversee the administration of plan benefits including final participant distributions preparing and coordinating the plan’s final regulatory filings calculating plan benefits under supplemental retirement plans making benefit determinations under the terms of a plan handling participant or beneficiary appeals communicating with participants and beneficiaries as appropriate experience we assumed full responsibility for a defined benefit plan where the plan sponsor had entered bankruptcy we developed an investment policy consistent with the plan’s liabilities and anticipated termination and then restructured the portfolio investments accordingly this involved selling equity assets reinvesting the proceeds into a number of fixed income positions negotiating disposition of several private investment positions and actively managing the cash position to cover variable levels of lump sum distributions in this case the plan sponsor had acquired a number of plans through merger  we worked with the plan sponsor to transition plan recordkeeping operations to an outsourced provider where records were incomplete in many cases because of the acquisition activity we developed plan communications and managed the outsourced provider service agreement  we worked with the trustee to resolve distribution issues missing participants lost checks and stale checks we were responsible for assuring that all regulatory filings were made and that the plan remained in compliance during our assignment we assumed full responsibility for a defined contribution plan where the plan sponsor had entered bankruptcy under chapter  which was converted to a chapter   we worked with the plan sponsor and the investment advisor to establish a reserve account for payment of plan expenses related to distributing the assets to participants  we maintained an investment array that was appropriate for the period during which the plan assets were distributed  after an extensive search for missing participants we established rollover iras for them we were responsible for assuring that all regulatory filings were made and that the plan remained in compliance during our assignment in each of the above examples we worked cooperatively with investment managers plan consultants trustees auditors and other vendors as frequently as necessary to ensure optimal resolution for plan participants next steps the terms of any particular plan and the status of its sponsor will play a large role in determining the need for an independent plan administrator fiduciary counselors has experience stepping into the role of plan administrator in both
