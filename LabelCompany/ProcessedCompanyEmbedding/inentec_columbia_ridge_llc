washington as the first commercialscale prototype  in  this system was used in performance tests conducted by the environmental technology evaluation center “evtec”  the evtec testing data served as the technical basis for the firstever rcra  tsca mixed waste permit issued by the us environmental protection agency  in the us “mixed waste” often refers to a combination of hazardous and nuclear waste tsca waste includes pcb waste the evtec data was also the basis for an “equivalency determination” issued by us epa which contained epa’s concurrence that the destructive effectiveness of the pem exceeds the mandated requirements that apply to hazardous waste incinerators thus making the pem an “equivalent technology” for processing hazardous waste inentec llc – model g richland wa usa

inentec select page pem process details the pem® system uses heating from electrically conducting gas a plasma to convert waste feeds to valuable products  pem systems are highly effective in processing a wide variety of waste streams including hazardous medical radioactive industrial municipal and tire wastes transforming them into valuable commercial products including energy ultraclean power generation or transportation fuels production using the syngas and industrial materials chemicals from the syngas roofing tiles insulating panels sandblasting media and other constructionrelated products from the glass and recoverable metals the pem system is environmentally attractive based on its minimal environmental impact and ability to provide neartotal destruction of organic materials providing large volume and weight reduction feed systems feedstock is introduced to the pem process through a feed system designed specifically for the type of materials being processed pregasifier the pregasifier acts as a ìpreliminaryî processing zone in which a majority approximately  of the organic portion of the feedstock is converted to syngas  the remaining feedstock consisting of inorganic materials dirt glass and metal for example carbon and other unprocessed organics pass through to the outlet at the bottom of the pregasifier and into the pem process chamber pem process chamber the remaining feed materials from the pregasifier are dropped onto a molten glass surface near the plasmaarc zone within the pem process chamber  the plasma arc provides the intense energy needed to rapidly gasify the remaining organic materials converting them to syngas  the remaining inorganic components are incorporated into the molten glass bath  the syngas exits the pem process chamber and flows to the thermal residence chamber trc thermal residence chamber trc syngas streams from the pregasifier and the pem process chamber are ducted to the trc which is designed to provide additional residence time at a high enough temperature to fully process any remaining organic materials present in the syngas and allow the gasification reaction to reach equilibrium ac and dc power supplies the primary power supply system for the pem introduces both jouleheating and plasma energy into the pem process chamber by means of separate power supplies for the dc plasma and the ac joule heating system  the dc power is used to produce the plasmaarc which provides most of the energy for gasification of the feed material  the independent ac power heats and maintains the glass bath temperature allowing the plasmaarc power to be focused on the gasification process and not on maintaining the molten pool as in typical plasmabased systems drain power supplies the drain power supplies are used to operate the drains which allow molten glass and metal to be removed from the system during operation syngas cleaning the syngas leaving the trc is cleaned and conditioned in a series of standard processes to prepare it for use in any final products syngas products the syngas may be used for a variety of applications such as electric generation liquid fuels production or

conscience inentec plasma gasified waste september 9   aasupple   comments acre columbia ridge landfill in arlington oregon processes  tons of household trash weekly by train from seattle and by truck from portland  it is owned by waste management as of november  not all the trash arriving at columbia ridge got buried  some of it was destined for a special kind of treatment—one that could redefine how we think about trash “our goal is to extract as much value as possible from waste and this project will help us recover resources to generate clean fuels renewable energy and other beneficial products” said dean kattler area vice president for waste management pacific northwest there is value in trash if you can unlock it  s energy solutions and waste management combined and built the first commercial plant in the us that uses plasma gasification to convert municipal household garbage into gas products the seemingly scifi transformation occurs because the trash is blasted apart by plasma  plasma is a cloud of protons neutrons and electrons where all the electrons have come loose from their respective molecules and atoms giving the plasma the ability to act as a whole rather than as a bunch of atoms  plasma is like gas in that you can’t grip or pour it but because extreme heat ionizes some atoms adding or subtracting electrons causing conductivity it behaves differently from gas plasma until now plasma gasification has proven too energy and capital intensive for real world use on everyday trash  the value of the syngas produced was worth less than the amount of energy required to power the furnaces and melt the trash the us generates about  million tons of trash a year even with recycling and composting facilities tackling an estimated  million tons of refuse per year it would take thousands of expensive new plants to handle the nation’s municipal trash output jeff surma cofounder of s energy solutions may have finally solved that problem s refers to plasma the fourth state of matter the other three are solid liquid and gas in 9 freshly graduated from montana state university he was hired by pacific northwest national laboratory to work on nuclear waste beginning with the manhattan project the us government cooked most of the plutonium for america’s nuclear weapons arsenal with its nine nuclear reactors giant plutonium processing plants and buried tanks of radioactive sludge earning the site the distinction of being one of the most contaminated nuclear waste sites in the western hemisphere surma’s first project was to work on jouleheated melters a method for processing nuclear waste this chemical process known as vitrification immobilizes radioactive materials in an inert form of glass the team was able to convert all the nuclear waste into fourfoottall canisters of vitrified glass but the facility also had huge quantities of  lowlevel radioactive trash that couldn’t go to a landfill and wasn’t suited for vitrification so surma learned about the plasma torch that scientists at nasa were using to mimic the effect of extreme heat on manned spacecraft reentering the atmosphere and that plasma for processing waste was being used in the metal and chemical industries to dispose of their very expensive toxic sludge simultaneously ge highvoltage engineer charles titus became convinced that the current technology using metal torches didn’t work because they got damaged by the very heat they delivered  so he created plasma with an electric arc strung between two graphite electrodes also around that time mit physicist dan cohn at plasma science and fusion center was searching for plasma technology’s possible environmental applications cohn titus and surma connected and before long they were brainstorming on how to get the technology to dispose of the billions of tons of common household trash msw the challenge was the high energy costs the heterogeneity of municipal solid waste and the toxins in heavy metals busted televisions microwave ovens dead batteries broken thermometers old paints that aren’t broken down by plasma and need to be safely kept away from all water supplies the trio also knew that the massive municipal solid waste market would need a clean system with no harmful byproducts or their project could look like another form of incineration that has a bad reputation due to the air pollution it creates surma thought they could combine plasma with vitrification to handle the harmful byproducts but they needed to keep the resulting molten inert glass byproducts at the bottom of the vessel from cooling down and hardening since this molten glass needs alternating current to maintain steady temperature and the electric arc for the plasma runs on direct current titus designed a system that would enable dc and ac to cohabitate within a plasma gasification furnace with a melter  the team calculated that this approach would provide just enough energy to sustain the plasma atomize the trash and keep the glass in a molten state within a few months jeff surma dan cohn and charles titus  launched their company integrated environmental technologies inentec their first commercial units were sold to boeing and kawasaki which produce lots of hazardous waste at a great disposal cost “it was always our intent from the very first patent to go after the municipal solid waste stream” surma said “but customer pull drew us into more lucrative hazardous and medicalwaste treatment” with inentec’s chief engineer jim batdorf they tried to come up with ways to make their technology economically feasible  for the more challenging miscellaneous content of household garbage the breakthrough was to stack a conventional gasifier above the plasmaenhanced melter  the trash gets heated and treated by this preliminary gasifier then moves into the chamber with the plasma zapper and vitrification  this strategy improves efficiency because it takes less energy for the plasma to blast materials that are already heated the machine is illustrated below by jim batdorf  gasification  a conveyer belt delivers shredded trash into a chamber mixed with oxygen and steam heated to  degrees fahrenheit transforming about  percent of the waste into a mixture of gases that are piped out of the system  plasma blasting  material that doesn’t succumb to the initial heat enters a specially insulated cauldron  an degree fahrenheit electric arc runs between two electrodes creating a plasma zone in the center of the container  exposed to this intense heat almost all the remaining trash gets blasted into  atomic elements and the resulting gases are piped out  hazmat capture  at the bottom of the cauldron sits a jouleheated melter that maintains a molten glass bath to trap any hazardous material left over from the plasma process  recycling  the inert molten glass is drawn out of the system to be converted into lowvalue materials such as road aggregate  the liquified metals are recycled into steel  fuel capture the sequestered syngas mostly carbon monoxide and hydrogen is cleaned sold and converted to fuels like diesel and ethanol used to produce electricity on sight and off or used as a substitute for natural gas in heating and electricity generation  after a review that lasted more than two years waste management determined that inentec was one of the few firms in the world whose plasma gasification technology looked viable  waste management started as an equity interest in senergy solutions llc a joint venture with inentec inc and later became an equity partner in inentec the two companies are developing a plasma gasification plant in arlington oregon using inentec’s plasma enhanced melter pem technology and waste management’s columbia ridge landfill carl rush a senior vice president at waste management says “the easy answer used to be store it in a can put it in a truck and then send it to a big hole in the ground  we’re moving away from that as a society” people don’t like landfills it’s becoming costlier to transport and bury garbage and even in the spacious american west landfills are gradually butting up against more backyards and inching their way toward local water tables waste management the largest owner of landfills hopes they will help accelerate the transition to an era in which the very idea of garbage itself is garbage  and they want to be positioned to profit when that time comes  time to invest trashtofuel technology has been around since the 9s  burning waste to generate electricity produces a stew of byproducts that need to be disposed of no matter how fancy the emissions scrubbers are  so environmentalists and some in the industry have remained skeptical of trashtofuel because it doesn’t address concerns for our overconsumption it diverts resources and focus from recycling programs and msw plasma gasification technology is still too new to make any difference construction of the columbia ridge plant was recently completed and the oregon department of environmental quality has issued all the permits necessary for the facility to begin operations  the plant is still so new that it remains to be seen whether the quality and quantity of the syngas can produce fuel good enough to use  the operation will begin as a small  ton per day commercial demonstration plant that’s  tons short of the msw the landfill currently takes in so  will we get a guiltfreeenergyproducing solution to our waste problems  some things to consider httpwwwmdpubcomgasifier     for a diy home gasifier  this guy is a true engineer mind communities that have installed waste conversion facilities tend to have a more positive opinion of the technologies according to the epa realworld cost

gasification of msw saves — mmbtu per ton as compared to landfill disposal additional research that could be done in the near term to advance the understanding of conversion technologies might include  high vs low feedstock btu value  plant energy conversion efficiency  recovery of msw for recycling  beneficial uses for different end gases  distance to market for syngas  market prices for energy products market prices for recyclables and other byproducts how you can help use less—no matter how efficient we make our processes and no matter how well we deal with waste we cannot reach carbon

represents the ultimate in recycling because it actually rearranges the molecular structure of lowvalue materials waste and transforms them into highvalue products such as transportation fuels
