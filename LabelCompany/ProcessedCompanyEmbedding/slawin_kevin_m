crossreference to related applicationsthis application claims priority to us provisional application no  filed february   which is incorporated herein in its entirety statement regarding federally sponsored researchthis invention was made in part with government support under grant no pc awarded by the department of defense the united states government may have certain rights in the invention technical fieldthe present invention is drawn to compositions and methods to enhance an immune response more particularly the composition is an inducible costimulatory polypeptide and is induced by ligand oligomerization background of the inventiondendritic cells dc are unique among antigenpresenting cells apc by virtue of their potent capacity to activate immunologically naive t cells steinman  dc express constitutively or after maturation several molecules that mediate physical interaction with and deliver activation signals to responding t cells these include class i and class ii mhc molecules cdso b and cd b cd cdacd lfa and cd icam steinman  steinman et al  dc also secrete upon stimulation several t cellstimulatory cytokines including ilbeta il il macrophageinflammatory proteinalpha mipalpha and mipdelta matsue et al  kitajima et al  ariizumi et al  caux et al  heufler et al  schreiber et al  enk et al  mohamadzadeh et al  both of these properties adhesion molecule expression and cytokine production are shared by other apc eg activated macrophages and b cells which are substantially less competent in activating naive t cells t cell activation is an important step in the protective immunity against pathogenic microorganisms eg viruses bacteria and parasites foreign proteins and harmful chemicals in the environment t cells express receptors on their surfaces ie t cell receptors that recognize antigens presented on the surface of antigenpresenting cells during a normal immune response binding of these antigens to the t cell receptor initiates intracellular changes leading to t cell activation dc express several different adhesion and costimulatory molecules which mediate their interaction with t cells the combinations of receptors on dc and counterreceptors on t cells that are known to play this role include a class i mhc and cd b class ii mhc and cd c cd icam and cdacd lfa d icam and cdacd e lfa and cd f cd b and cd and ctla g cd b and cd and ctla and h cd and cdl steinman et al  importantly not only does ligation of these molecules promote physical binding between dc and t cells it also transduces activation signals the dendritic cell dc orchestrates several critical steps in the development of an adaptive immune response dcs communicate information regarding the antigenic state of the peripheral tissues to the local lymph nodes upon detection of both pathogenderived and endogenous danger signals the dc physiologically adapts to its microenvironment by undergoing a genetic program known as maturation in order to direct an effective t cell response the unique machinery of the dc allows it not only to induce the activation of naïve t cells but also to regulate their subsequent phenotype and function these impressive attributes make the dc an ideal choice for their exploitation as natural adjuvants in cancer vaccine development however the limited successes of recent clinical trials indicate that current dc therapeutic strategies are in need of further refinement if dc immunotherapy is to be included in the cancer treatment arsenal alongside the more traditional modalities of chemo and radiotherapy this translation of dc vaccine development into the clinic will rely significantly upon advancements in our understanding of basic dc biology one of the critical deficiencies of dcbased vaccines is their transient nature the activation state and the longevity of dcs are significantly limited less than  hours following exposure to bacteriaderived lipopolysaccharide lps dcs terminate synthesis of the il cytokine and become refractory to further stimuli this implies that the cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl activation potential of dcs is severely compromised a relatively short time following its activation vaccine studies indicate that the survival of antigenpulsed dcs within the draining lymph node is dramatically reduced  hours following their delivery and undetectable by  hours these findings justify the need for alternative strategies for dc vaccine design such as the development of genetically altered dcs that can circumvent physiological regulatory mechanisms and exhibit enhanced immunostimulatory properties for the treatment of cancer and other diseases brief summary of the inventionthe present invention is directed to a composition and method that induces

the expression construct contains a membranetargeting sequence one with skill in the art realizes that appropriate expression constructs may include a costimulatory polypeptide element on either side of the above fkbp ligandbinding elements the expression construct of the present invention may be inserted into a vector for example a viral vector or plasmid a costimulatory polypeptidesin the

proteins that are contemplated in the present invention include for example but are not limited to the members of tumor necrosis factor tnf family ie cd ranktrancer ox b tolllike receptors creactive protein receptors pattern recognition receptors and hsp receptors typically the cytoplasmic domains from these costimulatory polypeptides are used in the expression vector the cytoplasmic domain from one of the various costimulatory polypeptides including mutants thereof where the recognition sequence involved in initiating transcription associated with the cytoplasmic domain is known or a gene responsive to such sequence is known in specific embodiments of the present invention the costimulatory polypeptide molecule is cd the cd molecule comprises a nucleic acid molecule which  hybridizes under stringent conditions to a nucleic acid having the sequence of a known cd gene and  codes for an cd polypeptide preferably the cd polypeptide is lacking the extracellular domain it is contemplated that other normal or mutant variants of cd can be used in the present invention exemplary polynucleotide sequences that encode cd polypeptides include but are not limited to seqidno  and cd isoforms from other species in certain embodiments the present invention involves the manipulation of genetic material to produce expression constructs that encode an inducible form of cd icd such methods involve the generation of expression constructs containing for example a heterologous nucleic acid sequence encoding cd cytoplasmic domain and a means for its expression replicating the vector in an appropriate helper cell obtaining viral particles produced therefrom and infecting cells with the recombinant virus particles thus the preferable cd molecule of the present invention lacks the extracellular domain in specific embodiments the extracellular domain is truncated or removed it is also contemplated that the extracellular domain can be mutated using standard mutagenesis insertions deletions or substitutions to produce an cd molecule that does not have a functional extracellular domain the preferred cd nucleic acid has the nucleic acid sequence of seqidno  the cd nucleic acids of the invention also include homologs and alleles of a nucleic acid having the sequence of seqidno  as well as functionally equivalent fragments variants and analogs of the foregoing nucleic acids in the context of gene therapy the gene will be a heterologous polynucleotide sequence derived from a source other than the viral genome which provides the backbone of the vector the gene is derived from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic source such as a bacterium a virus yeast a parasite a plant or even an animal the heterologous dna also is derived from more than one source ie a multigene construct or a fusion protein the heterologous dna also may include a regulatory sequence which is derived from one source and the gene from a different source b ligandbinding domainsthe ligandbinding dimerization domain of the expression construct of this invention can be any convenient domain that will allow for induction using a natural or unnatural ligand preferably an unnatural synthetic ligand the ligandbinding domain can be internal or external to the cellular membrane depending upon the nature of the construct and the choice of ligand a wide variety of ligandbinding proteins including receptors are known including ligandbinding proteins associated with the cytoplasmic regions indicated above as used herein the term ligandbinding domain can be interchangeable with the term receptor of particular interest are ligandbinding proteins for which ligands preferably small organic ligands are known or may be readily produced these ligandbinding domains or receptors include the fkbps and cyclophilin receptors the steroid receptors the tetracycline receptor the other receptors indicated above and the like as well as unnatural receptors which can be obtained from antibodies particularly the heavy or light chain subunit mutated sequences thereof random amino acid sequences obtained by stochastic procedures combinatorial syntheses and the like for the most part the ligandbinding domains or receptor domains will be at least about  amino acids and fewer than about  amino acids usually fewer than  amino acids either as the natural domain or truncated active portion thereof preferably the binding domain will be small  kda to allow efficient transfection in viral vectors monomeric this rules out the avidinbiotin system nonimmunogenic and should have synthetically accessible cell permeable nontoxic ligands that can be configured for dimerization the receptor domain can be intracellular or extracellular depending upon the design of the expression construct and the availability of an appropriate ligand for hydrophobic ligands the binding domain can be on either side of the membrane but for hydrophilic ligands particularly protein ligands the binding domain will usually be external to the cell membrane unless there is a transport system for internalizing the ligand in a form in which itis available for binding for an intracellular receptor the construct can encode a signal peptide and transmembrane domain  or  of the receptor domain sequence or by having a lipid attachment signal sequence  of the receptor domain sequence where the receptor domain is between the signal peptide and the transmembrane domain the receptor domain will be extracellular the portion of the expression construct encoding the receptor can be subjected to mutagenesis for a variety of reasons the mutagenized protein can provide for higher binding affinity allow for discrimination by the ligand of the naturally occurring receptor and the mutagenized receptor provide opportunities to design a receptorligand pair or the like the change in the receptor can involve changes in amino acids known to be at the binding site random mutagenesis using combinatorial techniques where the codons for the amino acids associated with the binding site or other amino acids associated with conformational changes can be subject to mutagenesis by changing the codons for the particular amino acid either with known changes or randomly expressing the resulting proteins in an appropriate prokaryotic host and then screening the resulting proteins for binding antibodies and antibody subunits eg heavy or light chain particularly fragments more particularly all or part of the variable region or fusions of heavy and light chain to create highaffinity binding can be used as the binding domain antibodies that are contemplated in the present invention include ones that are an ectopically expressed human product such as an extracellular domain that would not trigger an immune response and generally not expressed in the periphery ie outside the cnsbrain area such examples include but are not limited to low affinity nerve growth factor receptor lngfr and embryonic surface proteins ie carcinoembryonic antigen yet further antibodies can be prepared against haptenic molecules which are physiologically acceptable and the individual antibody subunits screened for binding affinity the cdna encoding the subunits can be isolated and modified by deletion of the constant region portions of the variable region mutagenesis of the variable region or the like to obtain a binding protein domain that has the appropriate affinity for the ligand in this way almost any physiologically acceptable haptenic compound can be employed as the ligand or to provide an epitope for the ligand instead of antibody units natural receptors can be employed where the binding domain is known and there is a useful ligand for binding c oligomerizationthe transduced signal will normally result from ligandmediated oligomerization of the chimeric protein molecules ie as a result of oligomerization following ligandbinding although other binding events for example allosteric activation can be employed to initiate a signal the construct of the chimeric protein will vary as to the order of the various domains and the number of repeats of an individual domain for multimerizing the receptor the ligand for the ligandbinding domainsreceptor domains of the chimeric surface membrane proteins will usually be multimeric in the sense that it will have at least two binding sites with each of the binding sites capable of binding to the receptor domain desirably the subject ligands will be a dimer or higher order oligomer usually not greater than about tetrameric of small synthetic organic molecules the individual molecules typically being at least about  d and fewer than about  kda usually fewer than about  kda a variety of pairs of synthetic ligands and receptors can be employed for example in embodiments involving natural receptors dimeric fk can be used with an fkbp receptor dimerized cyclosporin a can be used with the cyclophilin receptor dimerized estrogen with an estrogen receptor dimerized glucocorticoids with a glucocorticoid receptor dimerized tetracycline with the tetracycline receptor dimerized vitamin d with the vitamin d receptor and the like alternatively higher orders of the ligands eg trimeric can be used for embodiments involving unnatural receptors eg antibody subunits modified antibody subunits or modified receptors and the like any of a large variety of compounds can be used a significant characteristic of these ligand units is that they bind the receptor with high affinity and are able to be dimerized chemically in certain embodiments the present invention utilizes the technique of chemically induced dimerization cid to produce a conditionally controlled protein or polypeptide in addition to this technique being inducible it also is reversible due to the degradation of the labile dimerizing agent or administration of a monomeric competitive inhibitor cid system uses synthetic bivalent ligands to rapidly crosslink signaling molecules that are fused to ligandbinding domains cid this system has been used to trigger the oligomerization and activation of cell surface spencer et al  spencer et al  blau et al  or cytosolic proteins luo et al  maccorkle et al  the recruitment of transcription factors to dna elements to modulate transcription ho et al  rivera et al  or the recruitment of signaling molecules to the plasma membrane to stimulate signaling spencer et al  holsinger et al  the cid system is based upon the notion that surface receptor aggregation effectively activates downstream signaling cascades in the simplest embodiment the cid system uses a dimeric analog of the lipid permeable immunosuppressant drug fk which loses its normal bioactivity while gaining the ability to crosslink molecules genetically fused to the fkbinding protein fkbp by fusing one or more fkbps and a myristoylation sequence to the cytoplasmic signaling domain of a target receptor one can stimulate signaling in a dimerizer drugdependent but ligand and ectodomainindependent manner this provides the system with temporal control reversibility using monomeric drug analogs and enhanced specificity the high affinity of thirdgeneration apap cids for their binding domain fkbp permits specific activation of the recombinant receptor in vivo without the induction of nonspecific side effects through endogenous fkbp in addition the synthetic ligands are resistant to protease degradation making them more efficient at activating receptors in vivo than most delivered protein agents the ligands used in the present invention are capable of binding to two or more of the ligandbinding domains one skilled in the art realizes that the chimeric proteins may be able to bind to more than one ligand when they contain more than one ligandbinding domain the ligand is typically a nonprotein or a chemical exemplary ligands include but are not limited to dimeric fk eg fk since the mechanism of cd activation is fundamentally based on trimerization this receptor is particularly amenable to the cid system cid regulation provides the system with  temporal control  reversibility by addition of a nonactive monomer upon signs of an autoimmune reaction and  limited potential for nonspecific side effects in addition inducible in vivo dc cd activation would circumvent the requirement of a second danger signal normally required for complete induction of cd signaling and would potentially promote dc survival in situ allowing for enhanced t cell priming thus engineering dc vaccines to express icd amplifies the t cellmediated killing response by upregulating dc expression of antigen presentation molecules adhesion molecules th promoting cytokines and prosurvival factors other dimerization systems contemplated include the coumermycindna gyrase b system coumermycininduced dimerization activates a modified raf protein and stimulates the map kinase cascade see farrar et al  d membranetargetinga membranetargeting sequence provides for transport of the chimeric protein to the cell surface membrane where the same or other sequences can encode binding of the chimeric protein to the cell surface membrane any membranetargeting sequence can be employed that is functional in the host and may or may not be associated with one of the other domains of the chimeric protein such sequences include but are not limited to myristoylationtargeting sequence palmitoylation targeting sequence prenylation sequences ie farnesylation geranylgeranylation caax box or transmembrane sequences utilizing signal peptides from receptors e selectable markersin certain embodiments of the invention the expression constructs of the present invention contain nucleic acid constructs whose expression is identified in vitro or in vivo by including a marker in the expression construct such markers would confer an identifiable change to the cell permitting easy identification of cells containing the expression construct usually the inclusion of a drug selection marker aids in cloning and in the selection of tiansformants for example genes that confer resistance to neomycin puromycin hygromycin dhfr gpt zeocin and histidinol are useful selectable markers alternatively enzymes such as herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase tk are employed immunologic markers also can be employed the selectable marker employed is not believed to be important so long as it is capable of being expressed simultaneously with the nucleic acid encoding a gene product further examples of selectable markers are well known to one of skill in the art and include reporters such as egfp βgal or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cat f control regions promotersthe particular promoter employed to control the expression of a polynucleotide sequence of interest is not believed to be important so long as it is capable of directing the expression of the polynucleotide in the targeted cell thus where a human cell is targeted it is preferable to position the polynucleotide sequencecoding region adjacent to and under the control of a promoter that is capable of being expressed in a human cell generally spearing such a promoter might include either a human or viral promoter in various embodiments the human cytomegalovirus cmv immediate early gene promoter the sv early promoter the rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat βactin rat insulin promoter and glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase can be used to obtain highlevel expression of the coding sequence of interest the use of other viral or mammalian cellular or bacterial phage promoters which are well known in the art to achieve expression of a coding sequence of interest is contemplated as well provided that the levels of expression are sufficient for a given purpose by employing a promoter with wellknown properties the level and pattern of expression of the protein of interest following transfection or transformation can be optimized selection of a promoter that is regulated in response to specific physiologic or synthetic signals can permit inducible expression of the gene product for example in the case where expression of a transgene or transgenes when a multicistronic vector is utilized is toxic to the cells in which the vector is produced in it is desirable to prohibit or reduce expression of one or more of the transgenes examples of transgenes that are toxic to the producer cell line are proapoptotic and cytokine genes several inducible promoter systems are available for production of viral vectors where the transgene products are toxic add in more inducible promoters the ecdysone system invitrogen carlsbad ca is one such system this system is designed to allow regulated expression of a gene of interest in mammalian cells it consists of a tightly regulated expression mechanism that allows virtually no basal level expression of the transgene but over fold inducibility the system is based on the heterodimeric ecdysone receptor of drosophila and when ecdysone or an analog such as muristerone a binds to the receptor the receptor activates a promoter to turn on expression of the downstream transgene high levels of mrna transcripts are attained in this system both monomers of the heterodimeric receptor are constitutively expressed from one vector whereas the ecdysoneresponsive promoter which drives expression of the gene of interest is on another plasmid engineering of this type of system into the gene transfer vector of interest would therefore be useful cotransfection of plasmids containing the gene of interest and the receptor monomers in the producer cell line would then allow for the production of the gene transfer vector without expression of a potentially toxic transgene at the appropriate time expression of the transgene could be activated with ecdysone or muristeron a another inducible system that would be useful is the tetoff™ or teton™ system clontech palo alto ca originally developed by gossen and bujard gossen and bujard  gossen et al  this system also allows high levels of gene expression to be regulated in response to tetracycline or tetracycline derivatives such as doxycycline in the teton™ system gene expression is turned on in the presence of doxycycline whereas in the tetoff™ system gene expression is turned on in the absence of doxycycline these systems are based on two regulatory elements derived from the tetracycline resistance operon of e coli the tetracycline operator sequence to which the tetracycline repressor binds and the tetracycline repressor protein the gene of interest is cloned into a plasmid behind a promoter that has tetracyclineresponsive elements present in it a second plasmid contains a regulatory element called the tetracyclinecontrolled transactivator which is composed in the tetoff™ system of the vp domain from the herpes simplex virus and the wildtype tertracycline repressor thus in the absence of doxycycline transcription is constitutively on in the teton™ system the tetracycline repressor is not wild type and in the presence of doxycycline activates transcription for gene therapy vector production the tetoff™ system would be preferable so that the producer cells could be grown in the presence of tetracycline or doxycycline and prevent expression of a potentially toxic transgene but when the vector is introduced to the patient the gene expression would be constitutively on in some circumstances it is desirable to regulate expression of a transgene in a gene therapy vector for example different viral promoters with varying strengths of activity are utilized depending on the level of expression desired in mammalian cells the cmv immediate early promoter if often used to provide strong transcriptional activation modified versions of the cmv promoter that are less potent have also been used when reduced levels of expression of the transgene are desired when expression of a transgene in hematopoietic cells is desired retroviral promoters such as the ltrs from mlv or mmtv are often used other viral promoters that are used depending on the desired effect include sv rsv ltr hiv and hiv ltr adenovirus promoters such as from the ea ea or mlp region aav ltr hsvtk and avian sarcoma virus similarly tissue specific promoters are used to effect transcription in specific tissues or cells so as to reduce potential toxicity or undesirable effects to nontargeted tissues for example promoters such as the psa associated promoter or prostatespecific glandular kallikrein in certain indications it is desirable to activate transcription at specific times after administration of the gene therapy vector this is done with such promoters as those that are hormone or cytokine regulatable cytokine and inflammatory protein responsive promoters that can be used include k and t kininogen kageyama et al  cfos tnfalpha creactive protein arcone et al  haptoglobin oliviero et al  serum amyloid a cebp alpha il il poli and cortese  complement c wilson et al  il alpha acid glycoprofein prowse and baumann  alpha antitrypsin lipoprotein lipase zechner et al  angiotensinogen ron et al  fibrinogen cjun inducible by phorbol esters tnfalpha uv radiation retinoic acid and hydrogen peroxide collagenase induced by phorbol esters and retinoic acid metallothionein heavy metal and glucocorticoid inducible stromelysin inducible by phorbol ester interleukin and egf alpha macroglobulin and alpha antichymotrypsin it is envisioned that any of the above promoters alone or in combination with another can be useful according to the present invention depending on the action desired in addition this list of promoters should not be construed to be exhaustive or limiting those of skill in the art will know of other promoters that are used in conjunction with the promoters and methods disclosed herein  enhancersenhancers are genetic elements that increase transcription from a promoter located at a distant position on the same molecule of dna enhancers are organized much like promoters that is they are composed of many individual elements each of which binds to one or more transcriptional proteins the basic distinction between enhancers and promoters is operational an enhancer region as a whole must be able to stimulate transcription at a distance this need not be true of a promoter region or its component elements on the other hand a promoter must have one or more elements that direct initiation of rna synthesis at a particular site and in a particular orientation whereas enhancers lack these specificities promoters and enhancers are often overlapping and contiguous often seeming to have a very similar modular organization any promoterenhancer combination as per the bukaryotic promoter data base epdb can be used to drive expression of the gene eukaryotic cells can support cytoplasmic transcription from certain bacterial promoters if the appropriate bacterial polymerase is provided either as part of the delivery complex or as an additional genetic expression construct  polyadenylation signalswhere a cdna insert is employed one will typically desire to include a polyadenylation signal to effect proper polyadenylation of the gene transcript the nature of the polyadenylation signal is not believed to be crucial to the successful practice of the invention and any such sequence is employed such as human or bovine growth hormone and sv polyadenylation signals also contemplated as an element of the expression cassette is a terminator these elements can serve to enhance message levels and to minimize read through from the cassette into other sequences  initiation signals and internal ribosome binding sitesa specific initiation signal also may be required for efficient translation of coding sequences these signals include the atg initiation codon or adjacent sequences exogenous translational control signals including the atg initiation codon may need to be provided one of ordinary skill in the art would readily be capable of determining this and providing the necessary signals it is well known that the initiation codon must be inframe with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert the exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be either natural or synthetic the efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements in certain embodiments of the invention the use of internal ribosome entry sites ires elements is used to create multigene or polycistronic messages ires elements are able to bypass the ribosomescanning model of  methylated capdependent translation and begin translation at internal sites pelletier and sonenberg  ires elements from two members of the picornavirus family polio and encephalomyocarditis have been described pelletier and sonenberg  as well an ires from a mammalian message macejak and sarnow  ires elements can be linked to heterologous open reading frames multiple open reading frames can be transcribed together each separated by an ires creating polycistronic messages by virtue of the ires element each open reading frame is accessible to ribosomes for efficient translation multiple genes can be efficiently expressed using a single promoterenhancer to transcribe a single message see us patent nos  and  each herein incorporated by reference iv methods of gene transferin order to mediate the effect of the transgene expression in a cell it will be necessary to transfer the expression constructs of the present invention into a cell such transfer may employ viral or nonviral methods of gene transfer this section provides a discussion of methods and compositions of gene transfer a transformed cell comprising an expression vector is generated by introducing into the cell the expression vector suitable methods for polynucleotide delivery for transformation of an organelle a cell a tissue or an organism for use with the current invention include virtually any method by which a polynucleotide eg dna can be introduced into an organelle a cell a tissue or an organism as described herein or as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art a host cell can and has been used as a recipient for vectors host cells may be derived from prokaryotes or eukaryotes depending upon whether the desired result is replication of the vector or expression of part or all of the vectorencoded polynucleotide sequences numerous cell lines and cultures are available for use as a host cell and they can be obtained through the american type culture collection atcc which is an organization that serves as an archive for living cultures and genetic materials in specific embodiments the host cell is a dendritic cell which is an antigenpresenting cell it is well within the knowledge and skill of a skilled artisan to determine an appropriate host generally this is based on the vector backbone and the desired result a plasmid or cosmid for example can be introduced into a prokaryote host cell for replication of many vectors bacterial cells used as host cells for vector replication andor expression include dhα jm and kc as well as a number of commercially available bacterial hosts such as sure® competent cells and solopack™ gold cells stratagene® la jolla ca alternatively bacterial cells such as e coli le could be used as host cells for phage viruses eukaryotic cells that can be used as host cells include but are not limited to yeast insects and mammals examples of mammalian eukaryotic host cells for replication andor expression of a vector include but are not limited to hela niht jurkat  cos cho saos and pc examples of yeast strains include but are not limited to yph yph and yph a nonviral transfer ex vivo transformationmethods for transfecting vascular cells and tissues removed from an organism in an ex vivo setting are known to those of skill in the art for example canine endothelial cells have been genetically altered by retroviral gene transfer in vitro and transplanted into a canine wilson et al  in another example yucatan minipig endothelial cells were transfected by retrovirus in vitro and transplanted into an artery using a doubleballoon catheter nabel et al  thus it is contemplated that cells or tissues may be removed and transfected ex vivo using the polynucleotides of the present invention in particular aspects the transplanted cells or tissues may be placed into an organism thus it is well within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to isolate dendritic cells from an animal transfect the cells with the expression vector and then administer the transfected or transformed cells back to the animal  injectionin certain embodiments a polynucleotide may be delivered to an organelle a cell a tissue or an organism via one or more injections ie a needle injection such as for example subcutaneously intradermally intramuscularly intravenously intraperitoneally etc methods of injection of vaccines are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art eg injection of a composition comprising a saline solution further embodiments of the present invention include the introduction of a polynucleotide by direct microinjection the amount of the expression vector used may vary upon the nature of the antigen as well as the organelle cell tissue or organism used intradermal intranodal or intralymphatic injections are some of the more commonly used methods of dc administration intradermal injection is characterized by a low rate of absorption into the bloodstream but rapid uptake into the lymphatic system the presence of large numbers of langerhans dendritic cells in the dermis will transport intact as well as processed antigen to draining lymph nodes proper site preparation is necessary to perform this correctly ie hair must be clipped in order to observe proper needle placement intranodal injection allows for direct delivery of antigen to lymphoid tissues intralymphatic injection allows direct administration of dcs  electroporationin certain embodiments of the present invention a polynucleotide is introduced into an organelle a cell a tissue or an organism via electroporation electroporation involves the exposure of a suspension of cells and dna to a highvoltage electric discharge in some variants of this method certain cell walldegrading enzymes such as pectindegrading enzymes are employed to render the target recipient cells more susceptible to transformation by electroporation than untreated cells us patent no  incorporated herein by reference transfection of eukaryotic cells using electroporation has been quite successful mouse preb lymphocytes have been transfected with human kappaimmunoglobulin genes potter et al  and rat hepatocytes have been transfected with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene turkaspa et al  in this manner  calcium phosphatein other embodiments of the present invention a polynucleotide is introduced to the cells using calcium phosphate precipitation human kb cells have been transfected with adenovirus  dna graham and van der eb  using this technique also in this manner mouse la mouse c cho cv bhk niht and hela cells were transfected with a neomycin marker gene chen and okayama  and rat hepatocytes were transfected with a variety of marker genes rippe et al   deaedextranin another embodiment a polynucleotide is delivered into a cell using deaedextran followed by polyethylene glycol in this manner reporter plasmids were introduced into mouse myeloma and erythroleukemia cells gopal   sonication loadingadditional embodiments of the present invention include the introduction of a polynucleotide by direct sonic loading ltk fibroblasts have been transfected with the thymidine kinase gene by sonication loading fechheimer et al   liposomemediated transfectionin a further embodiment of the invention a polynucleotide may be entrapped in a lipid complex such as for example a liposome liposomes are vesicular structures characterized by a phospholipid bilayer membrane and an inner aqueous medium multilamellar liposomes have multiple lipid layers separated by aqueous medium they form spontaneously when phospholipids are suspended in an excess of aqueous solution the lipid components undergo selfrearrangement before the formation of closed structures and entrap water and dissolved solutes between the lipid bilayers ghosh and bachhawat  also contemplated is a polynucleotide complexed with lipofectamine gibco brl or superfect qiagen  receptor mediated transfectionstill further a polynucleotide may be delivered to a target cell via receptormediated delivery vehicles these take advantage of the selective uptake of macromolecules by receptormediated endocytosis that will be occurring in a target cell in view of the cell typespecific distribution of various receptors this delivery method adds another degree of specificity to the present invention certain receptormediated gene targeting vehicles comprise a cell receptorspecific ligand and a polynucleotidebinding agent others comprise a cell receptorspecific ligand to which the polynucleotide to be delivered has been operatively attached several ligands have been used for receptormediated gene transfer wu and wu  wagner et al  perales et al  myers epo  which establishes the operability of the technique specific delivery in the context of another mammalian cell type has been described wu and wu  incorporated herein by reference in certain aspects of the present invention a ligand is chosen to correspond to a receptor specifically expressed on the target cell population in other embodiments a polynucleotide delivery vehicle component of a cellspecific polynucleotidetargeting vehicle may comprise a specific binding ligand in combination with a liposome the polynucleotides to be delivered are housed within the liposome and the specific binding ligand is functionally incorporated into the liposome membrane the liposome will thus specifically bind to the receptors of a target cell and deliver the contents to a cell such systems have been shown to be functional using systems in which for example epidermal growth factor egf is used in the receptormediated delivery of a polynucleotide to cells that exhibit upregulation of the egf receptor in still further embodiments the polynucleotide delivery vehicle component of a targeted delivery vehicle may be a liposome itself which will preferably comprise one or more lipids or glycoproteins that direct cellspecific binding for example lactosylceramide a galactoseterminal asialoganglioside have been incorporated into liposomes and observed an increase in the uptake of the insulin gene by hepatocytes nicolau et al  it is contemplated that the tissuespecific transforming constructs of the present invention can be specifically delivered into a target cell in a similar manner  microprojectile bombardmentmicroprojectile bombardment techniques can be used to introduce a polynucleotide into at least one organelle cell tissue or organism us patent no  us patent no  us patent no  and pct application wo  each of which is incorporated herein by reference this method depends on the ability to accelerate dnacoated microprojectiles to a high velocity allowing them to pierce cell membranes and enter cells without killing them klein et al  there are a wide variety of microprojectile bombardment techniques known in the art many of which are applicable to the invention in this microprojectile bombardment one or more particles may be coated with at least one polynucleotide and delivered into cells by a propelling force several devices for accelerating small particles have been developed one such device relies on a high voltage discharge to generate an electrical current which in turn provides the motive force yang et al  the microprojectiles used have consisted of biologically inert substances such as tungsten or gold particles or beads exemplary particles include those comprised of tungsten platinum and preferably gold it is contemplated that in some instances dna precipitation onto metal particles would not be necessary for dna delivery to a recipient cell using microprojectile bombardment however it is contemplated that particles may contain dna rather than be coated with dna dnacoated particles may increase the level of dna delivery via particle bombardment but are not in and of themselves necessary b viral vectormediated transferin certain embodiments transgene is incorporated into a viral particle to mediate gene transfer to a cell typically the virus simply will be exposed to the appropriate host cell under physiologic conditions permitting uptake of the virus the present methods are advantageously employed using a variety of viral vectors as discussed below  adenovirusadenovirus is particularly suitable for use as a gene transfer vector because of its midsized dna genome ease of manipulation high titer wide targetcell range and high infectivity the roughly  kb viral genome is bounded by  base pair bp inverted terminal repeats itr in which are contained cisacting elements necessary for viral dna replication and packaging the early e and late l regions of the genome that contain different transcription units are divided by the onset of viral dna replication the e region ea and eb encodes proteins responsible for the regulation of transcription of the viral genome and a few cellular genes the expression of the e region ea and eb results in the synthesis of the proteins for viral dna replication these proteins are involved in dna replication late gene expression and host cell shut off renan  the products of the late genes l l l l and l including the majority of the viral capsid proteins are expressed only after significant processing of a single primary transcript issued by the major late promoter mlp the mlp located at  map units is particularly efficient during the late phase of infection and all the mrnas issued from this promoter possess a  tripartite leader tl sequence which makes them preferred mrnas for translation in order for adenovirus to be optimized for gene therapy it is necessary to maximize the carrying capacity so that large segments of dna can be included it also is very desirable to reduce the toxicity and immunologic reaction associated with certain adenoviral products the two goals are to an extent conterminous in that elimination of adenoviral genes serves both ends by practice of the present invention it is possible achieve both these goals while retaining the ability to manipulate the therapeutic constructs with relative ease the large displacement of dna is possible because the cis elements required for viral dna replication all are localized in the inverted terminal repeats itr  bp at either end of the linear viral genome plasmids containing itrs can replicate in the presence of a nondefective adenovirus hay et al  therefore inclusion of these elements in an adenoviral vector should permit replication in addition the packaging signal for viral encapsulation is localized between  bp  map units at the left end of the viral genome hearing et al  this signal mimics the protein recognition site in bacteriophage λ dna where a specific sequence close to the left end but outside the cohesive end sequence mediates the binding to proteins that are required for insertion of the dna into the head structure e substitution vectors of ad have demonstrated that a  bp  map units fragment at the left end of the viral genome could direct packaging in  cells levrero et al  previously it has been shown that certain regions of the adenoviral genome can be incorporated into the genome of mammalian cells and the genes encoded thereby expressed these cell lines are capable of supporting the replication of an adenoviral vector that is deficient in the adenoviral function encoded by the cell line there also have been reports of complementation of replication deficient adenoviral vectors by helping vectors eg wildtype virus or conditionally defective mutants replicationdeficient adenoviral vectors can be complemented in trans by helper virus this observation alone does not permit isolation of the replicationdeficient vectors however since the presence of helper virus needed to provide replicative functions would contaminate any preparation thus an additional element was needed that would add specificity to the replication andor packaging of the replicationdeficient vector that element as provided for in the present invention derives from the packaging function of adenovirus it has been shown that a packaging signal for adenovirus exists in the left end of the conventional adenovirus map tibbetts  later studies showed that a mutant with a deletion in the ea  bp region of the genome grew poorly even in a cell line that complemented the early ea function hearing and shenk  when a compensating adenoviral dna  bp was recombined into the right end of the mutant the virus was packaged normally further mutational analysis identified a short repeated positiondependent element in the left end of the ad genome one copy of the repeat was found to be sufficient for efficient packaging if present at either end of the genome but not when moved towards the interior of the ad dna molecule hearing et al  by using mutated versions of the packaging signal it is possible to create helper viruses that are packaged with varying efficiencies typically the mutations are point mutations or deletions when helper viruses with low efficiency packaging are grown in helper cells the virus is packaged albeit at reduced rates compared to wildtype virus thereby permitting propagation of the helper when these helper viruses are grown in cells along with virus that contains wildtype packaging signals however the wildtype packaging signals are recognized preferentially over the mutated versions given a limiting amount of packaging factor the virus containing the wildtype signals is packaged selectively when compared to the helpers if the preference is great enough stocks approaching homogeneity should be achieved  retrovirusthe retroviruses are a group of singlestranded rna viruses characterized by an ability to convert their rna to doublestranded dna in infected cells by a process of reversetranscription coffin  the resulting dna then stably integrates into cellular chromosomes as a provirus and directs synthesis of viral proteins the integration results in the retention of the viral gene sequences in the recipient cell and its descendants the retroviral genome contains three genes  gag pol and env  that code for capsid proteins polymerase enzyme and envelope components respectively a sequence found upstream from the gag gene termed ψ functions as a signal for packaging of the genome into virions two long terminal repeat ltr sequences are present at the  and  ends of the viral genome these contain strong promoter and enhancer sequences and also are required for integration in the host cell genome coffin  in order to construct a retroviral vector a nucleic acid encoding a promoter is inserted into the viral genome in the place of certain viral sequences to produce a virus that is replicationdefective in order to produce virions a packaging cell line containing the gag pol and env genes but without the ltr and ψ components is constructed mann et al  when a recombinant plasmid containing a human cdna together with the retroviral ltr and ψ sequences is introduced into this cell line by calcium phosphate precipitation for example the ψ sequence allows the rna transcript of the recombinant plasmid to be packaged into viral particles which are then secreted into the culture media nicolas and rubenstein  temin  mann et al  the media containing the recombinant retroviruses is collected optionally concentrated and used for gene transfer retroviral vectors are able to infect a broad variety of cell types however integration and stable expression of many types of retroviruses require the division of host cells paskind et al  an approach designed to allow specific targeting of retrovirus vectors recently was developed based on the chemical modification of a retrovirus by the chemical addition of galactose residues to the viral envelope this modification could permit the specific infection of cells such as hepatocytes via asialoglycoprotein receptors should this be desired a different approach to targeting of recombinant retroviruses was designed in which biotinylated antibodies against a retroviral envelope protein and against a specific cell receptor were used the antibodies were coupled via the biotin components by using streptaviclin roux et al  using antibodies against major histocompatibility complex class i and class ii antigens the infection of a variety of human cells that bore those surface antigens was demonstrated with an ecotropic virus in vitro roux et al   adenoassociated virusaav utilizes a linear singlestranded dna of about  base pairs inverted terminal repeats flank the genome two genes are present within the genome giving rise to a number of distinct gene products the first the cap gene produces three different virion proteins vp designated vp vp and vp the second the rep gene encodes four nonstructural proteins ns one or more of these rep gene products is responsible for transactivating aav transcription the three promoters in aav are designated by their location in map units in the genome these are from left to right p p and p transcription gives rise to six transcripts two initiated at each of three promoters with one of each pair being spliced the splice site derived from map units  is the same for each transcript the four nonstructural proteins apparently are derived from the longer of the transcripts and three virion proteins all arise from the smallest transcript aav is not associated with any pathologic state in humans interestingly for efficient replication aav requires helping functions from viruses such as herpes simplex virus i and ii cytomegalovirus pseudorabies virus and of course adenovirus the best characterized of the helpers is adenovirus and many early functions for this virus have been shown to assist with aav replication lowlevel expression of aav rep proteins is believed to hold aav structural expression in check and helper virus infection is thought to remove this block the terminal repeats of the aav vector can be obtained by restriction endonuclease digestion of aav or a plasmid such as p which contains a modified aav genome samulski et al  or by other methods known to the skilled artisan including but not limited to chemical or enzymatic synthesis of the terminal repeats based upon the published sequence of aav the ordinarily skilled artisan can determine by wellknown methods such as deletion analysis the minimum sequence or part of the aav itrs which is required to allow function ie stable and sitespecific integration the ordinarily skilled artisan also can determine which minor modifications of the sequence can be tolerated while maintaining the ability of the terminal repeats to direct stable sitespecific integration aavbased vectors have proven to be safe and effective vehicles for gene delivery in vitro and these vectors are being developed and tested in preclinical and clinical stages for a wide range of applications in potential gene therapy both ex vivo and in vivo carter and flotte   chatterjee et al  ferrari et al  fisher et al  flotte et al  goodman et al  kaplitt et al   kessler et al  koeberl et al  mizukami et al  aavmediated efficient gene transfer and expression in the lung has led to clinical trials for the treatment of cystic fibrosis carter and flotte  flotte et al  similarly the prospects for treatment of muscular dystrophy by aavmediated gene delivery of the dystrophin gene to skeletal muscle of parkinsons disease by tyrosine hydroxylase gene delivery to the brain of hemophilia b by factor ix gene delivery to the liver and potentially of myocardial infarction by vascular endothelial growth factor gene to the heart appear promising since aavmediated transgene expression in these organs has recently been shown to be highly efficient fisher et al  flotte et al  kaplitt et al   koeberl et al  mccown et al  ping et al  xiao et al   other viral vectorsother viral vectors are employed as expression constructs in the present invention vectors derived from viruses such as vaccinia virus ridgeway  baichwal and sugden  coupar et al  canary pox virus and herpes viruses are employed these viruses offer several features for use in gene transfer into various mammalian cells once the construct has been delivered into the cell the nucleic acid encoding the transgene are positioned and expressed at different sites in certain embodiments the nucleic acid encoding the transgene is stably integrated into the genome of the cell this integration is in the cognate location and orientation via homologous recombination gene replacement or it is integrated in a random nonspecific location gene augmentation in yet further embodiments the nucleic acid is stably maintained in the cell as a separate episomal segment of dna such nucleic acid segments or episomes encode sequences sufficient to permit maintenance and replication independent of or in synchronization with the host cell cycle how the expression construct is delivered to a cell and where in the cell the nucleic acid remains is dependent on the type of expression construct employed v enhancement of an immune responsein certain embodiments the present invention contemplates a novel dc activation strategy that incorporates the manipulation of signaling costimulatory polypeptides that activate nfκb pathways akt pathways andor p pathways this dc activation system can be used in conjunction with or without standard vaccines to enhance the immune response since it replaces the requirement for cd t cell help during apc activation bennett sr et al  ridge jp et al  schoenberger sp et al  thus the dc activation system of the present invention enhances immune responses by circumventing the need for the generation of mhc class iispecific peptides in specific embodiments the dc activation is via cd activation thus dc activation via endogenous cdcdl interactions may be subject to downregulation due to negative feedback leading rapidly to the il burnout effect within  to  hours after cd activation an alternatively spliced isoform of cd type ii is produced as a secretable factor tone m et al  type ii cd may act as a dominant negative receptor downregulating signaling through cdl and potentially limiting the potency of the immune response generated therefore the present invention coopts the natural regulation of cd by creating an inducible form of cd icd lacking the extracellular domain and activated instead by synthetic dimerizing ligands spencer dm et al  through a technology termed chemically induced dimerization cid the present invention comprises a method of enhancing the immune response in an subject comprising the step of administering either the expression vector expression construct or transduced antigenpresenting cells of the present invention to the subject the expression vector of the present invention encodes a costimulatory polypeptide such as icd in certain embodiments the antigenpresenting cells are comprised in an animal such as human nonhuman primate cow horse pig sheep goat dog cat or rodent the subject is a human more preferably a patient suffering from an infectious disease andor a subject that is immunocompromised or is suffering from a hyperproliferative disease in further embodiments of the present invention the expression construct andor expression vector can be utilized as a composition or substance that activates antigenpresenting cells such a composition that activates antigenpresenting cells or enhances the activity antigenpresenting cells refers to the ability to stimulate one or more activities associated with antigenpresenting cells such activities are well known by those of skill in the art for example a composition such as the expression construct or vector of the present invention can stimulate upregulation of costimulatory molecules on antigen presenting cells induce nuclear translocation of nfκb in antigen presenting cells activate toll like receptors in antigen presenting cells or other activities involving cytokines or chemokines an amount of a composition that activates antigenpresenting cells which enhances an immune response refers to an amount in which an immune response is observed that is greater or intensified or deviated in any way with the addition of the composition when compared to the same immune response measured without the addition of the composition for example the lytic activity of cytotoxic t cells can be measured eg using a cr release assay with and without the composition the amount of the substance at which the ctl lytic activity is enhanced as compared to the ctl lytic activity without the composition is said to be an amount sufficient to enhance the immune response of the animal to the antigen in a preferred embodiment the immune response in enhanced by a factor of at least about  more preferably by a factor of about  or more the amount of cytokines secreted may also be altered the enhanced immune response may be an active or a passive immune response alternatively the response may be part of an adaptive immunotherapy approach in which antigenpresenting cells are obtained with from a subject eg a patient then transduced with a composition comprising the expression vector or construct of the present invention the antigenpresenting cells may be obtained from the blood of the subject or bone marrow of the subject in certain preferred embodiments the antigenpresenting cells are isolated from the bone marrow in a preferred embodiment the antigenpresenting cells are administered to the same or different animal eg same or different donors in a preferred embodiment the subject eg a patient has or is suspected of having a cancer such as for example prostate cancer or has or is suspected of having an infectious disease in other embodiments the method of enhancing the immune response is practiced in conjunction with a known cancer therapy or any known therapy to treat the infectious disease the expression construct expression vector andor transduced antigenpresenting cells can enhance or contribute to the effectiveness of a vaccine by for example enhancing the immunogenicity of weaker antigens such as highly purified or recombinant antigens reducing the amount of antigen required for an immune response reducing the frequency of immunization required to provide protective immunity improve the efficacy of vaccines in subjects with reduced or weakened immune responses such as newborns the aged and immunocompromised individuals and enhance the immunity at a target tissue such as mucosal immunity or promote cellmediated or humoral immunity by eliciting a particular cytokine profile yet further an immunocompromised individual or subject is a subject that has a reduced or weakened immune response such individuals may also include a subject that has undergone chemotherapy or any other therapy resulting in a weakened immune system a transplant recipient a subject currently taking immunosuppressants an aging individual or any individual that has a reduced andor impaired cd t helper cells it is contemplated that the present invention can be utilize to ehance the amount andor activty of cd t helper cells in an immunocompromised subject in specific embodiments prior to administering the transduced antigenpresenting cell the cells are challenged with antigens also referred herein as target antigens after challenge the transduced loaded antigenpresenting cells are administered to the subject parenterally intradermally intranodally or intralymphatically additional parenteral routes include but are not limited to subcutaneous intramuscular intraperitoneal intravenous intraarterial intramyocardial transendocardial transepicardial intrathecal and infusion techniques the target antigen as used herein is an antigen or immunological epitope on the antigen which is crucial in immune recognition and ultimate elimination or control of the diseasecausing agent or disease state in a mammal the immune recognition may be cellular andor humoral in the case of intracellular pathogens and cancer immune recognition is preferably a t lymphocyte response the

each for organisms that contain a dna genome a gene encoding a target antigen or immunological epitope thereof of interest is isolated from the genomic dna for organisms with rna gnomes the desired gene may be isolated from cdna copies of the genome if restriction maps of the genome are available the dna fragment that contains the gene of interest is cleaved by restriction endonuclease digestion by methods routine in the art in instances where the desired gene has been previously cloned the genes may be readily obtained from the available clones alternatively if the dna sequence of the gene is known the gene can be synthesized by any of the conventional techniques for synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acids genes encoding an antigen of interest can be amplified by cloning the gene into a bacterial host for this purpose various prokaryotic cloning vectors can be used examples are plasmids pbr puc and pembl the genes encoding at least one target antigen or immunological epitope thereof can be prepared for insertion into the plasmid vectors designed for recombination with a virus by standard techniques in general the cloned genes can be excised from the prokaryotic cloning vector by restriction enzyme digestion in most cases the excised fragment will contain the entire coding region of the gene the dna fragment carrying the cloned gene can be modified as needed for example to make the ends of the fragment compatible with the insertion sites of the dna vectors used for recombination with a virus then purified prior to insertion into the vectors at restriction endonuclease cleavage sites cloning sites antigen loading of dendritic cells with antigens may be achieved by incubating dendritic cells or progenitor cells with the polypeptide dna naked or within a plasmid vector or rna or with antigenexpressing recombinant bacterium or viruses  eg vaccinia fowlpox adenovirus or lentivirus vectors prior to loading the polypeptide may be covalently conjugated to an immunological partner that provides t cell help eg a carrier molecule alternatively a dendritic cell may be pulsed with a nonconjugated immunological partner separately or in the presence of the polypeptide antigens from cells or mhc molecules may be obtained by acidelution or other methods known in the art see zitvogel et al  one skilled in the art is fully aware that activation of the costimulatory molecule of the present invention relies upon oligomerization of ligandbinding domains for example cid to induce its activity in specific embodiments the ligand is a nonprotein more specifically the ligand is a dimeric fk or dimeric fk analogs which result in enhancement or positive regulation of the immune response the use of monomeric fk or monomeric fk analogs results in inhibition or reduction in the immune response negatively tlymphocytes are activated by contact with the antigenpresenting cell that comprises the expression vector of the present invention and has been challenged transfected pulsed or electrofused with an antigen electrofusing in the present invention is a method of generating hybrid cells there are several advantages in producing cell hybrids by electrofusion for example fusion parameters can be easily and accurately electronically controlled to conditions depending on the cells to be fused further electrofusion of cells has shown to the ability to increase fusion efficiency over that of fusion by chemical means or via biological fusogens electrofusion is performed by applying electric pulses to cells in suspension by exposing cells to an alternating electric field cells are brought close to each other in forming pearl chains in a process termed dielectrophoresis alignment subsequent higher voltage pulses cause cells to come into closer contact reversible electropores are formed in reversibly permeabilizing and mechanically breaking down cell membranes resulting in fusion t cells express a unique antigen binding receptor on their membrane tcell receptor which can only recognize antigen in association with major histocompatibility complex mhc molecules on the surface of other cells there are several populations of t cells such as t helper cells and t cytotoxic cells t helper cells and t cytotoxic cells are primarily distinguished by their display of the membrane bound glycoproteins cd and cd respectively t helper cells secret various lymphokines that are crucial for the activation of b cells t cytotoxic cells macrophages and other cells of the immune system in contrast a naïve cd t cell that recognizes an antigenmhc complex proliferates and differentiates into an effector cell called a cytotoxic cd t lymphocyte ctl ctls eliminate cells of the body displaying antigen such as virusinfected cells and tumor cells by producing substances that result in cell lysis ctl activity can be assessed by methods described herein or as would be known to one of skill in the art for example ctls may be assessed in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc in a phytohaemaglutininstimulated il expanded cell line established from pbmc bernard et al  or by t cells isolated from a previously immunized subject and restimulated for  days with dc infected with an adenovirus vector containing antigen using standard  h cr release microtoxicity assays one type of assay uses cloned tcells cloned tcells have been tested for their ability to mediate both perforin and fas liganddependent killing in redirected cytotoxicity assays simpson et al  the cloned cytotoxic t lymphocytes displayed both fas and perforindependent killing recently an in vitro dehydrogenase release assay has been developed that takes advantage of a new fluorescent amplification system page et al  this approach is sensitive rapid and reproducible and may be used advantageously for mixed lymphocyte reaction mlr it may easily be further automated for largescale cytotoxicity testing using cell membrane integrity and is thus considered in the present invention in another fluorometric assay developed for detecting cellmediated cytotoxicity the fluorophore used is the nontoxic molecule alamarblue nociari et al  the alamarblue is fluorescently quenched ie low quantum yield until mitochondrial reduction occurs which then results in a dramatic increase in the alamarblue fluorescence intensity ie increase in the quantum yield this assay is reported to be extremely sensitive specific and requires a significantly lower number of effector cells than the standard cr release assay other immune cells that are induced by the present invention include natural killer cells nk nks are lymphoid cells that lack antigenspecinc receptors and are part of the innate immune system typically infected cells are usually destroyed by t cells alerted by foreign particles bound the cell surface mhc however virusinfected cells signal infection by expressing viral proteins that are recognized by antibodies these cells can be killed by nks in tumor cells if the tumor cells lose expression of mhc i molecules then it may be susceptible to nks in further embodiments the transduced antigenpresenting cell is transfected with tumor cell mrna the transduced transfected antigenpresenting cell is administered to an animal to effect cytotoxic t lymphocytes and natural killer cell antitumor antigen immune response and regulated using dimeric fk and dimeric fk analogs the tumor cell mrna is mrna from a prostate tumor cell yet further the transduced antigenpresenting cell is pulsed with tumorcell lysates the pulsed transduced antigenpresenting cells are administered to an animal to effect cytotoxic t lymphocytes and natural killer cell antitumor antigen immune response and regulated using dimeric fk and dimeric fk analogs

azithromycin capreomycin cefotaxime cefoxitin ceftriaxone chloramphenicol clarithromycin clindamycin clofazimine cycloserine dapsone doxycyeline ethambutol ethionamide fluconazole fluoroquinolones isoniazid itraconazole kanamycin ketoconazole minocycline ofloxacin paraaminosalicylic acid pentamidine polymixin definsins prothionamide pyrazinamide pyrimethamine sulfadiazine quinolones eg ciprofloxacin rifabutin rifampin sparfloxacin streptomycin sulfonamides tetracyclines thiacetazone trimethaprimsulfamethoxazole viomycin or combinations thereof more generally such an agent would be provided in a combined amount with the expression vector effective to kill or inhibit proliferation of a cancer cell andor microorganism this process may involve contacting the cells with an agents and the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention at the same time or within a period of time wherein separate administration of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention and an agent to a cell tissue or organism produces a desired therapeutic benefit this may be achieved by contacting the cell tissue or organism with a single composition or pharmacological formulation that includes both the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention and one or more agents or by contacting the cell with two or more distinct compositions or formulations wherein one composition includes the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention and the other includes one or more agents the terms contacted and exposed when applied to a cell tissue or organism are used herein to describe the process by which the pharmaceutical composition andor another agent such as for example a chemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic agent are delivered to a target cell tissue

expression vector yet further various combination regimens of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention and one or more agents may be employed viii transgenic animalsdetailed methods for generating nonhuman transgenic animal are described herein any nonhuman animal can be used in the methods described herein preferred mammals are rodents eg rats or mice a transgenic mouse describes an mouse that has had genes from another organism inserted into its genome through recombinant dna techniques the transgenic mouse may contain material from an unrelated organism such as from a virus plant or human thus in an exemplary embodiment the transgenic nonhuman animals of the invention are produced by introducing transgenes into the germline of the nonhuman animal introduction of the transgene into the embryo can be accomplished by any means known in the art such as for example microinjection electroporation or lipofection for example the cd gene can be introduced into a mammal by microinjection of the construct into the pronuclei of the fertilized mammalian eggs to cause one or more copies of the construct to be retained in the cells of the developing mammals following introduction of the transgene construct into the fertilized egg the egg may be incubated in vitro for varying amounts of time or reimplanted into the surrogate host or both in vitro incubation to maturity is within the scope of this invention one common method is to incubate the embryos in vitro for about  days depending on the species and then reimplant them into the surrogate host embryonic target cells at various developmental stages can also be used to introduce transgenes different methods are used depending on the stage of development of the embryonic target cell the specific lines of any animal used to practice this invention are selected for general good health good embryo yields good pronuclear visibility in the embryo and good reproductive fitness in addition the haplotype is a significant factor embryonic stem cells sometimes referred to as es cells are derived from inner cell mass icm of fertilized eggs in blastocyst phase and can be cultured and maintained in vitro while being kept in an undifferentiated state embryonic stem cells are extremely useful biological materials for preparing transgenic animals for example a gene knockout mouse in which a specific gene is inactivated can be produced by replacing an active gene in an embryonic stem cell chromosome with an inactivated gene by means of a homologous recombination system the progeny of the transgenically manipulated embryos can be tested for the presence of the cd construct by southern blot analysis of the segment of tissue if one or more copies of the exogenous cloned construct remains stably integrated into the genome of such transgenic embryos it is possible to establish permanent transgenic mammal lines carrying the transgenically added construct the litters of transgenically altered mammals can be assayed after birth for the incorporation of the construct into the genome of the offspring preferably this assay is accomplished by hybridizing a probe corresponding to the dna sequence coding for the desired recombinant protein product or a segment thereof onto chromosomal material from the progeny those mammalian progeny found to contain at least one copy of the construct in their genome are grown to maturity n certain embodiments of the invention transgenic mice are produced which contain an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide promoter sequence a polynucleotide sequence encoding a cd cytoplasmic domain and a polynucleotide sequence encoding a dimeric ligandbinding region all operatively linked these mice may be used to obtain antigenpresenting cells such as dendritic cells which express the cd cytoplasmic domain ix examplesthe following examples are included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention it should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventor to function well in the practice of the invention and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice however those of skill in the art should in light of the present disclosure appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention example development of techniques for efficient isolation of dcsbone marrow from the tibias and femurs of cbl mice was cultured in rpmi supplemented with gmcsf and il inaba k et al  bone marrow cultures were maintained for a total of  days in  well plates while onehalf of each well was replenished with fresh media and cytokines on day  on the final day of culture cells were washed from the plates coincubated with anticdc microbeads miltenyi biotec bergisch gladbach germany and applied to two consecutive magnetic columns splenic dcs were subjected to microbead purification immediately following collagenase treatment of splenic tissue based on flow cytometry analysis the dc purity of the final cell suspension was consistently  for bone marrowderived dcs and  for splenic dcs example development of techniques for efficient cellular electrofusiontwo jurkat t cell populations were individually stained with distinct lipophilic dyes fluorescing at different wavelengths dii and dio these cell populations were mixed and fused using the btx electrofusion instrument at different dc voltages fusion efficiency was analyzed by flow cytometry electrofusion of jurkat tag cells using a  v dc generated viable hybrid yields of around  example construction of an inducible cd vectoran inducible cd receptor based on chemicalinduced dimerization cid and patterned after endogenous cd activation was produced to specifically target dcs figure a the recombinant cd receptor termed icd was engineered by rtpcr amplifying the  bp cd cytoplasmic signaling domain from purified murine bone marrowderived dcs   cdc and subcloning the resulting dna fragment either downstream ie mfvfvlscde or upstream mcdfvfvlse of tandem copies of the dimerizing drug binding domain fkbpv figure b membrane localization was achieved with a myristoylationtargeting domain m and an ha epitope e tag was present for facile identification to determine if the transcripts were capable of activating nfκb the constructs were transiently transfected into jurkat t cells and nfκb reporter assays were preformed in the presence of titrated dimerizer drug ap figure c figure c showed that increasing levels of ap resulted in significant upregulation of nfκb transcriptional activity compared to the control vector mfvfvlse lacking cd sequence since the membraneproximal version of icd mcdfvfvlse was less responsive to ap in this assay system the mfvfvlscde construct was used in further studies and heretofore referred to as icd this decision was reinforced by the crystallographic structure of the cd cytoplasmic tail which reveals a hairpin conformation that could be deleteriously altered by the fusion of a heterologous protein to its carboxylterminus ni  the data also showed high drug dose suppression over  nm likely due to the saturation of drug binding domains this same phenomenon has been observed in other cell types expressing limiting levels of the icd receptor these results suggested that icd was capable of inducing ciddependent nuclear translocation of the nfκb transcription factor once the adicdgfp virus was demonstrated to successfully transduce t cells and to induce the expression of both icd and gfp transgenes bone marrowderived dendritic cells were transduced with efficiencies ranging between  under serumfree conditions the results have demonstrated that icdexpressing primary dcs exhibited an upregulation in maturation markers eg cd cd and an enhanced ability to synthesize the il cytokine when treated with cid in addition cidtreated icdexpressing primary dcs survived longer in culture and were capable of inducing a more robust ctl response in vivo compared to nontransduced dc and adgfptransduced dc controls example cell fusiontrampc murine prostate cancer cell line is cultured in high glucose media with insulin and dht and with cell tracker green dye cmfda molecular probes eugene or isolated dcs that are stained with cell tracker orange dye cmtmr molecular probes eugene or are fused to girradiated trampc cells using the labs btx electrocell manipulator  instrument genetronics san diego ca which applies an alternating current to dimerize cells at the center of an electrical field a high voltage direct current pulse is then released which fuses the membranes of the dimerized cells subjecting cells to harsh fusogenic conditions for shorter periods of time and producing higher hybrid yields than the standard polyethylene glycol fusion although irradiated the hybrid cells survive for several days example ctlifnγ assaysplenocytes and  lymph nodes are incubated with mitomycin ctreated and washed x trampb cells obtained from jim allison ucb after  days expandedviable t cells are ficollpurified and stimulated with trampcb a second time after  additional days dilutions of trampc cells preincubated for  days with  ngml ifnγ to boost mhc are incubated with t cells and analyzed for de novo ifnγ production alternatively target cells will be preloaded with cr for true ctl assays example determine whether icd activation in situ can increase antitumor immunitycultured proliferating dcs are transduced with adenovirus expressing icd and then fused with irradiated trampc cells as before for h timepoints dctramp heterokaryon are maintained in culture media supplemented with the dimerizer ap for  hours prior to vaccine preparation and administration for all other cid timepoints    and h postvaccination dimerizer ap are delivered to vaccinated and control mice by ip injection an additional control group receives dcicdtramp hybrids but no cid two weeks aftera booster vaccine mice will be challenged with  x  sc trampc cells as before the efficacy of icd stimulation in situ versus in vitro is correlated with measurements of tumor incidence and size and by ctl assays after dcicdtumor vaccination in the presence or absence of cid example transfection of dcs with mrnas from tumor cellsusing the methods of gilboa and colleagues gilboa et al  boczkowski d et al  cdnas made from trampc cells are amplified and subcloned into an expression vector following transcription in a reticulocyte lysate mrna is purified using a polyt primer and magnetic bead separation a number of lipidbased transfection protocols eg fugene superfectin are currently available and the most effective method based on control transfections of freshly amplified dcs using a reporter plasmid are used example pulsing of dcs with peptides from tumor cellsto increase the likelihood of transferring relevant tumorderived peptides capable of binding to mhc molecules dcs are pulsed with peptides derived from trampc cells since mhc levels are extremely low on cultured trampderived cells mhc levels on tumor cells are boosted using  ngml murine ifnγ mhcderived peptides are purified using hplc and acidtreated mhc using previously described methods nair sk et al  finally dcs are initially treated with antisense against the tap peptide transporter to increase the density of empty mhc on the surface as previously described nair sk et al  example pulsing of dcs with other antigensactive specific immunotherapy using vaccines consisting of isolated murine tumorderived hsppc was demonstrated against murine tumors tamura y et al  the gp itself is nonpolymorphic but acts as a chaperone for tightly bound immunogenic peptides which are believed to represent the full cellular repertoire of immunogens thus gp proteins are purified using an affinity column and used to prime dcs example icd activates nfκb in dcsthe physiological response of icd was evaluated in the immature dc line dsc lutz  which maintains a stable phenotype over prolonged culture periods the use of this dc line avoided confounding maturation effects that often occur spontaneously in primary dcs during typical culturing conditions icd was subcloned into a bicistronic vector coexpressing the neor gene and the resulting vector was electoporated into dsc cells dsc dcs stably expressing the icd transgene were selected in culture by g and clonal lines were derived by limiting dilution screening by probing for the haepitope tag allowed for high hi intermediate int and low lo icdexpressing dsc dc clones icd dcs to be selected for further analysis figure a additional immunofluorescence experiments were performed to verify the membrane localization of icd figure b reporter assays were carried out in these cell lines to determine whether icd could also induce nfκb activation in dcs increasing ap concentrations resulted in consistent elevation of nfκb activity that was further reflected in the levels of transgene expression by the respective dc lines figure c several studies have identified that the relb subunit of nfκb plays a significant role in the dc maturation program pettit  martin  indeed nuclear localization of relb correlated with the mature dc state and relb dcs exhibited a constitutively immature phenotype therefore as a surrogate marker for dc activation the nuclear translocation of reib was analyzed by western blot in icd dcs exposed to log dilutions of ap figure d additional results further confirmed that icd triggered the nuclear translocation of dcexpressed relb in a ciddependent manner dc activation potency of icd was compared with other traditional dc maturation stimuli such as lps tnfα anticd mab and cdl for the most informative comparison each agent was titrated to determine the optimal concentration for relb induction in icd dcs and these concentrations were utilized to directly compare relb activation by these different factors figure e the data clearly indicated that drugdependent reib induction in icd dcs is superior to lps tnfα anticd mab and cdl pulsechase experiments further revealed that the ap dimerizer drug stimulated a more prolonged and durable relb nuclear signal than tnfα or the anticd mab figure f while tnfαmediated relb induction terminated after  hrs and anticd mab induced relb up to  hrs the icd receptor stimulated the relb maturation pathway for at least  hrs in the presence of dimerizer drug these results suggested that upon drugmediated stimulation icd dcs are capable of maintaining a hyperextended activation state example icd induces dc activationa component of the dc maturation program includes the upregulation of several surface molecules that participate in the process of t cell stimulation by direct involvement in antigen presentation and costimulation therefore icd dcs were treated with ap and the surface expression of several of maturation markers including icam cd b cd mhc class i kd mhc class ii iad and endogenous cd figure a were analyzed by flow cytometry exposure of these dcs to cid resulted in significant elevations in the expression of each of these immunostimulatory proteins over untreated icd dcs and the parental dsc line this observed increase in the fluorescence intensity of these mature dc markers was comparable to that of lps from e colitreated dcs only minimal basal signaling of the icd receptor was detectable in untreated icd dcs and drug treatment of the parental control dsc line had no observable effect moreover when icd dcs were pretreated with an excess of a monomeric form of the drug dimerizer drugdependent upregulation of these surface markers was completely abolished indicating that physical aggregation of the cd cytoplasmic domain was absolutely required for inducing the mature dc phenotype in the dsc line when dcs undergo maturation they also exhibit functional alterations these changes include a reduced capacity to uptake molecules from their microenvironment and a concomitant enhancement of their ability to stimulate t cell activation druginduced modification of dsc dc receptormediated endocytosis was investigated by measuring the uptake of a fitctagged dextran molecule in icd dcs and the parental dsc line figure b cidmediated activation of icd dcs resulted in the reduced uptake of fitcdextran to levels comparable to that of lpstreated dcs at °c performing this same series of experiments at °c resulted in minimal uptake of the fitcdextran molecule confirming that icd activation is also capable of regulating the antigen uptake function of this dc line the initial approach to the determination of the t cell stimulation capacity of icd dcs involved the coincubation of mitomycin ctreated dsc dcs with syngeneic lymph node lnderived cells in vitro this mixed lymphocyte reaction mlr assay measured the ability of icd dcs to induce a syngeneic t cell proliferative response to bovine serumderived xenogeneic antigens figure c the results indicated that cidtreated icd dcs were capable of inducing t cell proliferation to levels similar to that of lpstreated dcs in vitro in order to investigate whether this t cell activation effect was dependent on cd t cell help cd t cells from ln tissue   were purified and the hthymidinebased proliferation assay was repeated figure c the data showed that icd dcs were capable of inducing cd t cell proliferation in a cdindependent manner as opposed to lpstreated dcs that failed to circumvent the requirement for cd t cellderived helper signals these results demonstrated that icdexpressing dcs that have been preexposed to the dimerizer drug exhibited greater t cell stimulation capacity in vitro furthermore the cddepletion data inferred that the icd receptor may be capable of substituting for cd t cell help in dcbased vaccination strategies example in vivo drugmediated activation of icd dcs following vaccinationsince in vitro conditions may not necessarily mirror the more physiologically relevant conditions in vivo the ability of icd dcs to induce an antigenspecific t cell response in vivo following drugmediated activation pre or postvaccine delivery was investigated  x  parental and icdexpressing dsc dcs were pulsed with the hkdrestricted peptide antigen llo derived from the listeriolysin o protein of listeria monocytogenes ± lps or ap  and injected intraperitoneally ip into syngeneic balbc mice a subset of mice receiving llopulsed dcs were injected ip with either ap or anticd mab ∼ hours following the initial vaccination finally splenocytes were harvested from lloprimed mice  days later and cocultured with mitomycin ctreated llopulsed and nonpulsed dcs for an additional  days before being evaluated for the uptake of hthymidine figure a the results indicated that in vivo activation of icd dcs by ap injection significantly enhanced the resulting t cell response relative to in vitro icd activation prior to dc vaccine delivery figure b furthermore the combined pre and post activation of icd dcs resulted in an additive t cell proliferative effect suggesting that the in vitro activation of dcs did not confer adverse effects such as attenuation of their migrational capacity as opposed to the in vitro t cell proliferation assay discussed above icd stimulation of dcs in vivo resulted in a significantly more robust t cell response compared to lpstreated dcs moreover using an hkdllospecific tetramer it was determined that a significant fraction of the responding t cell population was specific for the kdrestricted peptide epitope originally used to load the dcbased vaccine figure cd while tetramer analysis is a powerful aid in quantitating t cell populations it does not reflect t cell effector function in order to investigate the functionality of the t cells that respond to icd dc antigen presentation a pderived tumor cell line p which ectopically expresses the βgalactosidase βgal protein as a surrogate tumor antigen was utilized after vaccinating balbc mice with βgalloaded dcs and following the aforementioned culture protocol a crrelease cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl assay was performed to assess the ability of the stimulated t cells to destroy βgalexpressing tumor cells consistent with the in vivo t cell proliferation data presented above the delivery of ap following dc administration resulted in improved tumor cell killing relative to nonactivated or preactivated dcs figure d to further study the ctl response to icdexpressing dcs an lloexpressing a lymphoma line was generated by cloning inframe two tandem llo minigenes upstream of a hyggfp fusion protein this strategy allowed for selection of lloexpressing a tumor cells in culture with hygromycin and for tracking llo expression by flow cytometry analysis of enhanced green fluorescent protein egfp figure e the lloexpressing construct also included two adjacent aay amino acid sequences after each minigene to improve proteosomal processing efficiency of mhc class irestricted peptides despite flow cytometry profiles indicating that fusion of the llo peptide upstream of hyggfp destabilized the functionality of either the hygr gene or the fluorescence intensity of egfp the allo tumor line still exhibited greatly enhanced sensitivity to ctlmediated killing following priming by lloloaded apexposed icd dcs example icd activates primary bone marrowderived dcswhile dsc cells possess many characteristics of freshly isolated dcs it was important to examine icd functionality in primary bone marrowderived dcs bmdcs by utilizing an icdexpressing adenovirus a viral region el and edeleted replicationdeficient type  adenoviral vector was engineered to express both icd and egfp under the control of the cmv earlyimmediate promoterenhancer adicdgfp successfully transduced and expressed the icd transgene as well as the egfp marker in purified bmdcs figure ab titrating adicdgfp while measuring icdinduced upregulation of b cd showed that maximum drugmediated icd activation occurred at around  moi and proceeded asymptotically to plateau at higher viral titers although the effects were modest ap induced the surface expression of mhc class i kb b as well as endogenous cd on icdexpressing bmdcs at  moi but not on nontransduced dcs figure c the effects of adicdgfp on bmdcs were studied by using intracellular cytokine staining to evaluate dc expression of the thlpolarizing cytokine il the results confirmed numerous previous reports that an empty adenoviral vector can contribute to background fluorescence readings by stimulating the production of low levels of this cytokine figure d korst  these data also revealed that the icd transgene could generate a significant level of basal signaling at these titers even in the absence of cid however ap exposure of these icdexpressing dcs managed to reproducibly overcome these cumulative effects to further increase the percentage of il dcs interestingly the stimulation of ilpp synthesis with lps and cdl peaked at  hrs and decreased thereafter while the percentage of il dcs continued to increase until at least  hrs following adenoviral transduction previous work by langenkamp et al langenkamp has demonstrated that prolonged treatment of dcs with lps exhausted their capacity for cytokine production these results imply that icd as opposed to the lps danger signal was capable of promoting and maintaining a more durable il response by bmdcs in addition to dc activation state dc longevity is another critical variable that influences the generation of t celldependent immunity in facet ctlmediated killing of dcs is considered to be a significant mechanism for modulating immune responses while protecting the host from autoimmune pathologies other work has established that cd stimulation of dcs prolongs their survival by a variety of mechanisms including upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein bclxl and the granzyme b inhibitor spi medema  miga  the effects of icd relative to cdl on dc survival were compared in an in vitro serumstarvation culture assay figure e by analyzing the membrane compromised propidium iodide pipositive cell population by flow cytometry it was determined that icd expressingbmdcs exhibited greater longevity under these conditions compared to nontransduced dcs treated with cdl this effect was icddependent since adgfptransduced dcs failed to reflect improved survival under these conditions these results also showed that exposure of icd bmdcs to the ap dimerizer drug even further enhanced this survival effect relative to untreated bmdcs despite the unintended maturation induced by the adenoviral vector and the enhanced basal signaling effects of icd in primary bmdcs enhanced dc activation in the presence of ap was consistently detected overall these data suggest that an inducible cd receptor designed to respond to a pharmacological agent was capable of maintaining primary dcs in a sustained state of activation compared to the more transient effects of cdl stimulation these data were consistent with earlier findings describing only shortterm dc modulation for stimuli that target endogenous cd example icd activation switch functions as a potent adjuvant for dna vaccinesprevious studies have demonstrated that dcs play a critical role in the processing and presentation of dna vaccines to responding t cells therefore in order to examine the effects of icd on primary dc functionality in vivo the icd activation switch was incorporated into a gene gundependent dna vaccination protocol singh  gold microparticles were coated with an ova minigene plasmid in the presence and absence of a bicistronic vector coexpressing icd with the hrgfp reporter biolistic transfection of cbl mice with the ova minigene resulted in a ∼fold enhancement in the percent of ovaspecific cd t cells while the inclusion of the icdexpressing vector dramatically increased this same cd t cell population by an additional ∼fold figure ac although ap did not further stimulate the expansion of ovaspecific cd t cells ip administration of the dimerizer drug ∼ hours postvaccination did enhance the percentage of activated cd cd t cells figure b in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the icd system in the absence of cd t helper cells wildtype cbl and cdknockout t helper cell deficient mice were vaccinated using the above gene gun dna vaccination protocol figure a shows that the enhancement of antigenspecific cdt cell population existed in mice ∼ days following vaccination figure b shows the enhancement of activated cd cd t cells ∼ days following vaccination all the data was normalized to the antigen ova alone the data further demonstrated the enhanced potency of the drugregulated icd system relative to the fulllength cd receptor and the agonistic anticd monoclonal antibody thus these results demonstrated the efficacy of the icd activation switch in vivo and showed that icd can still upregulate cd t cell responses in the absence of cdt helper cells example insulated icd receptor is resistant to ligandinduced downregulation and to negative feedback inhibition mediated by the type ii cd isoformthe data presented above implies that the drugregulated icd receptor is capable of delivering a more potent stimulatory signal to dcs than the activation of endogenous cd it was determine that the underlying cause for this difference was based on the lack of an extracellular domain making icd resistant to both ligandinduced receptor downregulation and to interference by dominant negative receptors to initially investigate the potential downregulation of surface cd upon ligand engagement flow cytometric analysis of dc surface expression of cd was monitored in the presence and absence of cdl addition of cdl promptly reduced the mean fluorescence intensity of cd on the dsc dc line with rapid kinetics inhibition studies showed this process was sensitive to both the endocytosis inhibitor cytocholasin b as well as to intracellar potassiumdepletion suggesting that the mechanisms of receptormediated endocytosis played a role in cd regulation figure a furthermore treatment of the dsc line with the endosomal hatpase inhibitor balifomycin a enhanced total cd levels based on intracellular staining assays overall these results suggested that upon ligand engagement cd was taken up by endocytosis and degraded by lysosomal proteolytic processing figure b additional work indicates that the inhibition of cd endocytosis enhances its signaling capacity figure c expression of the truncated type ii isoform of cd which lacks both a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain was upregulated in response to dc maturation figure a previous work has shown that the type ii cd isoform abrogated surface expression as well as total cellular expression of type i cd tone et al  it was hypothesized that this inhibitory mechanism involved homotypic interactions between the extracellular domains of the type i and ii cd isoforms however no direct evidence was presented to provide further insight into this regulatory pathway therefore it was posited that icd would be resistant to type ii cdmediated inhibition due to the absence of a ligandbinding ectodomain to investigate the potential regulation of endogenous type i cd and icd by this alternatively spliced gene product the type ii cd isoform was rtpcramplified from purified bone marrowderived murine dcs and subcloned into a zeorexpressing vector inframe with the cmycderived epitope tag this construct was used to generate clonal doublestable dcs that expressed both icd and type ii cd iicd by selecting cell lines in g and zeocincontaining media high hi intermediate int and low lo iicdexpressing dc lines were selected by ahtimyc western blot analysis for further study figure b an antiha blot of these same icdncd dc lines demonstrated that the total cellular expression of icd was not affected by overexpression of the iicd transgene figure b however flow cytometry analysis of type i cd surface expression demonstrated a reduction in the mean fluorescence intensity of this receptor in iicdexpressing dc lines figure c moreover the predicted inverse relationship was found to exist between the expression level of type ii cd and the expression of type i cd these data was consistent with that of previous work that demonstrated iicdmediated type icd downregulation in a macrophage cell line to expand upon these findings the effects of cdl and ap titrations on each of the iicd lines were analyzed based on the hypothesis that iicdmediated type i cd downregulation should blunt the dc response to cdl but not to ap figure d using mhc class i hkd surface expression as a reporter the result revealed that iicd shifted the doseresponse curve such that elevated amounts of cdl were required to initiate signaling through the cd axis while in contrast ap induced even higher levels of hkd than the empty vector control overall these data confirmed the findings of tone et al and supported the notion that type i cdiicd interactions occurred via the homologous extracellular domains of these receptors furthermore these results suggested that the icd receptor switch was capable of circumventing negative feedback regulatory mechanisms involving dominant negative cd isoforms example generation of a cdc construct in order to generate a dcspecific icd transgenic mouseto generate a dcspecific icdexpressing transgenic mouse icd was subcloned into a vector containing the dcspecific cdllc promoter and purified by cscl gradient ultracentrifugation after sequencing the vector was shown to induce the expression of icd in t cells dna microinjections were performed in cbl mice bone marrowderived dcs were isolated from pcrpositive offspring for antiha western blots although icd protein expression was found in all mice the levels varied from barely detectable to easily detectable these mice are currently being bred for functional experiments but early results show pronounced expansion of splenic dcs in icdexpressing mice with increased activation of t cells following cid administration referencesall patents and publications mentioned in the specification are indicative of the levels of those skilled in the art to which the
