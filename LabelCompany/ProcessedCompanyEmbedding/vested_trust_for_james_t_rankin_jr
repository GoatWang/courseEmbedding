washington dc for defendants order duffy district judge this matter is currently before the court on defendant greatbanc trust companys greatbanc motion for summary judgment of plaintiffs second amended complaint greatbancs chief argument for summary judgment is that neither larry register nor esther houlihan have standing to bring a breach of fiduciary claim against it because neither former employee is a participant in the plan at issue defendants hagemeyer north america inc hagemeyer cameron  barkley company c  b m joel bateman j randall bishop paula p greer kenneth b sands william t tamsberg james warren paula p greer debra j guest david g gundling sandra gussman deborah b holden andros neocleous christopher c nowell kim palmer raymond perlock and jeffrey s rosenberg collectively the c  b defendants have also filed a motion for summary judgment adopting the reasoning set forth in defendant greatbancs memorandum as have defendants cambar software inc csi mary lou fox david l lea steven l raber thomas a skelton cecil duffie cheryl blocker allison mahoney amy mahoney and thomas stallings collectively the csi defendants in these motions defendants raise various arguments in favor of summary judgment however because the standing challenge first raised by defendant greatbanc calls into question this courts subject matter jurisdiction it is appropriate to address this issue at the outset and because the court after careful consideration finds that plaintiffs lack standing to pursue this action defendants motions for summary judgment are granted background the facts of this case as supported by the evidence and viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs are as follows c  b was a distributor of maintenance repair and operating products to the electrical construction industry it formed c  b employee stock ownership plan c  b esop in  c  b esop was an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of  usc § a and was administered in south carolina c  b created cambar software inc csi in  csi employees were eligible to and did participate in the c  b esop as a result certain participants in the c  b esop were allocated shares of both c  b and csi stock as well as a share of the c  b esops other assets other participants were allocated shares of either c  b or csi stock but not both as well as a share of the c  b esops other assets in or around september of  c  b entered into an agreement whereby hagemeyer would acquire complete ownership of c  b but not csi merger agreement because hagemeyer was not interested in purchasing csi the merger agreement separated the c  esop into two plans the c  b esop and a new csi esop participants were classified as either c  b participants or csi participants depending on where they were currently or last employed csi participants and their accompanying assets and liabilities were to be spun off to the new csi esop c  b participants were to remain in the c  b esop which was to be incorporated into a profit sharing k plan sponsored by hagemeyer upon consummation of the merger each share of c  bs common stock was converted into  per share in cash and the contingent right to receive a pro rata share of the amount to be distributed from an indemnity escrow fund at this point the still intact c  b esop contained only csi common stock and other assets including cash from the conversion of the c  b stock c  b participants were given the option of rolling over their share of the distribution either into a k plan or into an individual retirement account ira csi participants distributions were placed into an account for other csi assets under the c  b esop using the cash from the sale of c  b stock csi then bought back common shares in itself from the c  b participants for purposes of this exchange of csi stock for cash the csi stock was severely overvalued this overvalued stock plummeted in value after the spinoff as a result csi participants retirement funds are worth less than what they were worth prior to the merger and spinoff while the merger was still pending some participants were awaiting distributions from the c  b esop on december   at the direction of the c  b esops advisory committee greatbanc made a distribution to rufus barkley an officer or member of the board of directors of c  b for the distribution c  b esop cashed out barkleys account which had been allocated a total of  shares of csi stock at the time the c  b esop fiduciaries had valued csi stock at the inflated price of  per share on december   the c  b esop advisory committee authorized the payment of benefits to other participants awaiting distributions these participants also received distributions for their allocations of csi stock at the inflated price of  per share as a result of these distributions certain current and past executives and employees of c  b received a profits windfall while csi participants were left with csi stock worth far less than it had originally been worth plaintiffs larry register and esther houlihan are former employees of defendants c  b and csi as employees plaintiffs participated in these companies esops during the spinoff both plaintiffs were classified as csi participants both individual plaintiffs voluntarily terminated their employment with c  b and csi plaintiff register requested distribution of his csi esop account and his account balance was rolled over into the ira he designated on april   he subsequently received a check for the balance of his csi esop account on september   plaintiff houlihan received her benefits on october   plaintiffs originally filed this erisa action against defendants on august   on august   plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in which they asserted the following erisabased causes of action against the fiduciaries of the c  b esop and the csi esop i breach of fiduciary and cofiduciary duties by authorizing and making exchanges of csi stock for what the fiduciaries knew or should have known was more than the fair market value in violation of erisa  usc § aad and  usc §  count i complaint ¶  ii breach of fiduciary duty to monitor the plan and duty of loyalty to the plan in violation of erisa  usc § aab count ii complaint ¶¶  iii breach of fiduciary duty with respect to offsets of accrued pension benefits with artificially inflated csi stock in violation of erisa  usc § aad count iii complaint ¶¶  iv breach of fiduciary and cofiduciary duties by failing to monitor the conduct of the investing fiduciaries and failing to disclose to the investing fiduciaries material facts concerning csis financial condition in violation of erisa  usc § aab and  usc §  count iv complaint ¶¶  and v defendant csi violated erisa § b  usc § b by failing to promptly respond to plaintiffs request for the governing summary plan descriptions as a result of the defendant fiduciaries breaches of their duties plaintiffs allege that the value of the stock the csi participants received in the merger and spinoff of the plans was wrongfully diminished as such they and the other csi participants suffered actual losses to their individual csi esop accounts complaint ¶¶     because the fiduciaries violations of erisa allegedly resulted in real losses to plaintiffs and to the other participants of the csi esop plaintiffs seek in counts i ii iii and iv both  equitable relief pursuant to erisa §§ a  usc a and  recovery for losses to the plan caused by defendants breaches of their fiduciary duties pursuant to erisa § a  usc a and § a  usc § a complaint ¶¶       further in count v of the complaint plaintiffs allege that they were prejudiced by csis failure to timely provide plan documents in violation of erisa § b  usc § b complaint ¶  accordingly plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to  per day commencing thirty days after the first request for information was made to the date of defendant csis response to the request as provided by erisa § c  usc § c complaint ¶  on december   defendant greatbanc filed a motion for summary judgment contending that plaintiffs are former employees who have received their full distribution from the erisabased plan accordingly they no longer have standing as participants to pursue a civil action under erisa §   usc §  discussion this case involves the question whether plaintiffs are participants in a csi employee benefit plan as defined under the employee retirement income security act of  erisa the civil actions asserted by plaintiffs may be brought under erisa only by a plan participant beneficiary or fiduciary  usc § a   usc § c this is both a standing and a subject matter jurisdictional requirement stanton v gulf oil corp  fd   th cir plaintiffs who are former employees and former members of the csi esop purport to bring this action as participants in order to do so plaintiffs must meet the statutory definition of participant at the time the action was brought and maintain that status throughout their lawsuit lalonde v textron inc  fsuppd   dri  citing crawford v lamantia  fd   st cir plaintiffs status at the time the injury occurred is not relevant for standing purposes erisa defines participant as any employee or former employee of an employer    who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer    or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit  usc §  the supreme court has elaborated on this definition by explaining that former employees may be participants if they have  a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment or  a colorable claim to vested benefits see firestone tire  rubber co v bruch  us    sct   ledd   thus if a plaintiff has a legitimate claim for vested benefits he has standing irrespective of having received his full distribution from the erisabased plan id see eg swinney v general motors corp  fd   th cir explaining the but for exception and noting that a plaintiff who has divested himself of his plan holdings because of actions by the defendant has standing if he can show that he will prevail in a suit for benefits or that eligibility requirements will be fulfilled in the future see also rankin v rots  frd  edmich finding that plaintiff who divested herself of her plan holdings still had a colorable claim for vested benefits in sommers drug stores co employee profit sharing trust v corrigan which is cited by both plaintiffs and defendants the fifth circuit explained that the line between vested benefits and damages is not always clear  fd   th cir the court attempted to articulate the distinction as follows an allegation that benefits were wrongly computed clearly states a claim for vested benefits on the other hand a claim for an unascertainable amount with no demonstration that recovery would directly effect payments to the plaintiff states a claim for damages id at  here plaintiffs assert that despite the fact that they have received all of their benefits under the plain terms of the esop they still have a colorable claim to vested benefits response to greatbancs mot at  specifically they assert that they are not seeking damages based on what their assets might have accrued to in the future had the fiduciaries not acted imprudently rather    they both seek the value of their vested benefits in the c  b esop at the time of the fraudulent activity accordingly plaintiffs ask the court to require defendants to compensate the esop and therefore all participants for the value their shares lost due to defendants allegedly imprudent valuation of the csi stock in the spinoff the court finds however that even if plaintiffs can definitively prove the correct valuation of the csi stock at the time of the spinoff the court can only speculate as to what the value of the assets following the spinoff would have been but for the incorrect valuation as such plaintiffs can not identify a definite ascertainable value lost due to the fiduciaries breach of duty many courts have deemed similar requests for lost value to be too speculative to amount to a legitimate claim for vested benefits see eg crawford v lamantia  fd   st cir plaintiffs request that the court use its equitable powers to allocate funds to him and other esop members who were cashed out after defendants goingprivate transaction did not establish the value the esop lost in the transaction and was deemed too speculative to amount to a legitimate claim for vested benefits kuntz v reese  fd   th cir finding plaintiffs were not plan participants because if successful the plaintiffs claim would result in a damages award not in an increase of vested benefit emphasis added yancy v am petrofina  fd   th cir the plaintiffs claim for a sum that could not have been earned cannot be considered as vested under erisa in re aep erisa litigation  fsuppd   sdohio  having divested himself of his holdings in erisa plan after he filed erisa suit asserting breach of fiduciary duty former employee lacked standing to bring suit under  usc § a because his asserted right to sum that possibly could have been earned by prudent investment decisions sought damages that were too speculative to be considered vested under erisa lalonde v textron inc  fsuppd  dri finding that where plaintiffs did not claim that certain benefits were withheld or miscalculated but rather that defendants improper investment decisions concerning defendants stock resulted in diminished plan value their claim was not a claim for vested benefits hargrave v txu corp  fsuppd  ndtex plaintiffs allegations that the plan had been undervalued was a claim for additional damages that might have accrued but for the defendants alleged misconduct these damages are too speculative to be considered vested under erisa in re guidant corporation erisa litig  wl  sdind sept   where plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew from the plan after filing suit and did not claim that their distribution was less due to an error in calculation plaintiffs had no colorable claim for benefits but see sommers  fd at  holding that where plaintiffs asserted that the amount of money received and distributed to plan participants pursuant to the stock sale did not reflect the full value of benefits due under the terms of the plan plaintiffs had essentially stated a claim for the unpaid value of vested benefits ie the value not reflected in the stocks selling price thus the court found the claim close to a simple claim that benefits were miscalculated and held that plaintiffs were participants having standing under erisa the fourth circuit court of appeals has not yet weighed in on whether a claim for value lost due to a fiduciaries breach of duty is a claim for vested benefits or for damages in a recent case from this circuit however the honorable judge frederick motz of the district of maryland was presented with the issue of whether former participants in an erisa plan had standing under circumstances similar to those presented here in re mutual funds invest litig  wl   dmd aug   in that case plaintiffs were former employees of defendants who had participated in defined contribution plans sponsored by their employees id these former employees who had received distributions from the plans after terminating their employment claimed that while they were still invested in the plans the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under erisa and caused substantial losses to the plans id as a result of these losses the plaintiffs distributions were less than they should have been id the plaintiffs thereafter brought a cause of action under erisa § a  usc § a seeking to recover from the fiduciaries the losses to the plan id judge motz noted that numerous courts have found that former participants in an erisa plan lack standing under circumstances similar to those presented here id citing graden v conexant sys inc no   wl  at   us dist lexis  at  dnj mar   in re rcn litig no src  wl  at  dnj mar   holtzscher v dynegy inc no civ a   wl  at  sdtex mar   lalonde v textron ca no s  wl  at  dri mar   in re admin comm erisa litig no c pjf  wl  at  ndcal dec   judge motz concurring with the decisions in the abovecited cases concluded that although    the question is a close one the causes of action asserted in this action were more in the nature of claims for damages than for payment of a vested benefit in re mutual funds invest litig  wl   accordingly judge motz dismissed the plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction id in the case sub judice it is uncontested that plaintiffs are former employees who received distribution of their vested benefits under the csi esop on september   and october   plaintiffs do not allege that their distributions were improperly computed rather they allege that defendants breach of their fiduciary duties caused the plans assets at the time of the distributions to have been diminished the difference between what plaintiffs accounts might have been worth had the csi stock been properly valued during the spinoff and what the accounts actually were worth at the time of distribution is not a benefit that is promised under the terms of the esop under these facts the court finds that the recovery requested is more in the nature of claims for damages than for payment of a vested benefit accordingly because plaintiffs have no reasonable expectation of returning to csi as employees and have failed to prove that they have a colorable claim to vested benefits within the meaning of erisa plaintiffs are not participants as meant by erisa and therefore lack standing to pursue their claims pursuant to erisa §   usc §  conclusion it is therefore ordered for the foregoing reasons that defendants motions for summary judgment are granted it is further ordered that all other motions currently pending before the court are dismissed as moot and it is so ordered footnotes  at all times relevant to this action m joel bateman j randall bishop paula greer kenneth b sands william t tamsberg and james warren were members of the c  b esop advisory committee paula greer debra j guest david g gundling sandra gussman deborah b holden andros neocleous christopher c nowell kim palmer raymond perlock and jeffrey rosenberg were members of the

of directors david l lea was the president andor acting chief executive officer of c  b cecil duffie is the current chief executive officer of csi cheryl blocker allison mahoney amy mahoney and thomas stallings were members of the csi esop advisory committee  for purposes of this order the court refers to greatbanc the csi defendants and the c  b defendants collectively as defendants  in describing the facts of this case the court limits its discussion to those facts relevant to deciding the issue of standing  since its inception in  csis stock was consistently valued in the range of  to   the second amended complaint also asserted causes of action for quantum meruit recovery violation of federal securities laws and violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act the court dismissed these causes of action pursuant to fedrcivp b by order dated november    in paragraph  of the complaint plaintiffs assert that c  b csi and each of the named defendants are fiduciaries under erisa  section b of erisa provides that the administrator shall upon written request of any participant or beneficiary furnish a copy of the latest updated summary plan description and the latest annual report any terminal report the bargaining agreement trust agreement contract or other instruments under which the plan is established or operated  erisa § c  usc § c provides that any administrator    b who fails or refuses to comply with a request for any information which such administrator is required by this act to furnish to a participant or beneficiary unless such failure or refusal results from matters reasonably beyond the control of the administrator by mailing the material requested to the last known address of the requesting participant or beneficiary within  days after such request may in the courts discretion be personally liable to such participant or beneficiary in the amount of up to  a day from the date of such failure or refusal and the court may in its discretion order such other relief as it deems proper for purposes of this paragraph    each violation described in subparagraph b with respect to any single participant or beneficiary shall be treated as a separate violation  the secretary of labor is also authorized to bring a civil action pursuant to  usc § a  plaintiffs do not contest that they have no reasonable expectation of returning to csi as employees  defendants assert that plaintiffs have presented no evidence of the correct valuation of the csi stock they claim that plaintiffs were required to retain their own expert witness to ascertain a value of the csi shares as of the dates they claim the stock was overvalued and may not rely on the report provided by the secretary of labors expert randolph whitt plaintiffs demur asserting that their reliance on the report of expert randolph whitt is proper due to the consolidation of the secretarys case with their own case for the reasons stated above the court reaches its

entered onmarch   in the united states district court for the western district of  new york elfvin j rejecting on summary judgment motion plaintiffs claimthat certain pension plan benefits were preserved by the terms of an exceptionto a general release executed in connection with a stock purchase agreementand rejecting after trial plaintiffs claim to reform the release exception for mutual mistake and fraud in an order entered on april    wl judge elfvin partially granted defendants crossmotion for summary judgment ruling as a matter of law that the meaning of the exception languagefound in the general release clause of the stock purchase agreement thepurchase agreement entered into between healy and defendant richproducts corp rich products was governed by the employee retirementincome security act of   usc §  et seq  erisa and   backgroundthat the language did not preserve healys right to receive certain pension plan benefits judge elfvin denied both parties crossmotions for summary judgment on the issue of reformation of the release exception and scheduled a bench trial after the bench trial on march    wl  judgeelfvin rejected the reformation claim and directed the entry of judgmentdismissing healys complaintfrom  until  healy was an employee and officer of rich products hehis wife joanne and their children held thirtysix percent of the common stock of rich products as a result of gifts of stock made over the years by joannesfather robert rich sr rich chairman and chief executive officer of rich products rich at all times held voting control of the company in the fallof  joanne healy on the advice of her counsel francis j mcconnellrefused to sign a buysell agreement and a shareholder agreement submittedto her by her father the agreement contained voting and transfer restrictions onher rich products stock that were designed to insure that the company wouldremain under the control of the rich family joanne healys refusal to signthese agreements resulted in a rift between rich and the healy familyculminating in thomas healys resignation in december at the time of his resignation and since  healy was a participant in two benefit plans provided by rich products a deferred compensation agreementthe dca and an incentive compensation plan the icp collectively theplans he also was a participant in a k pension plan which is not atissue here pursuant to the terms of the dca healy was entitled to certainannual benefits for fifteen years following his retirement disability death or other termination of employment the icp also known as the phantom stock  plan provided that healy would periodically be awarded units each of whichentitled him to future payments based on the companys book value divided by healy was to receive payments upon his retirement disability deathor other termination of employment the icp benefits were to be paid annuallyfor ten years and an administrative committee was formed to oversee thedistribution of payments both plans contained nocompetition provisionsthe violation of which could result in forfeiture or suspension of benefits under the dca participants agreed not to compete with rich products for two yearsfollowing the termination of employment the icp prohibited competition for an unlimited period of time both plans also provided that the benefits were notsubject to assignment alienation or encumbrancein the spring of  after his resignation healy received the first installment   of benefits due under the dca and the first installment due under theicp after these initial payments  under the dca and under the icp remained to be paid healy was paid  fromthe k pension plan in a lump sum upon his resignationin may  jonathan golden rich products attorney contacted mcconnellto propose an immediate buyout of the healys rich products stock and relatedinterests after extended negotiations the parties ultimately agreed that richwould pay twentyfive million dollars for the healys interests prior to thedrafting of the agreement a question arose concerning the earnings of certainsubchapters corporations in which the healys owned shares of stock theshares were scheduled to be transferred as part of the agreement the earningsof these corporations had not been distributed to any of the stockholders andthe healys share of undistributed earnings amounted to  althoughrich was adamant about paying twentyfive million dollars and not one centmore healy inquired as to whether his familys share of such earnings would be paid despite the purchase agreement rich initially refused howevergolden explained that even if rich refused to pay the healys their shares of thedistributions the healys pro rata share of the distributions would be imputed tothem as taxable income thus the healys would incur a tax liability of twentyeight percent of the earnings effectively reducing the twentyfive million dollar  purchase price considering these facts rich agreed to pay an additionalamount equal to the tax liability of the subchapters corporations attributableto the healysgolden prepared the first draft of the purchase agreement and transmitted it byfacsimile to mcconnell on august   the draft included a provision for the execution of a general release releasing rich products from any and allliabilities and claims healy testified that after he reviewed the first draft hespecifically told mcconnell that he wanted to make it very clear that he did notwant to release his benefits under the plans mcconnell testified that he advisedgolden that healy did not want to release his remaining benefits or continuing benefits under the rich products pension and profitsharing plans mcconnelltestified that when golden asked which plans mcconnell was referring to hereplied by describing in detail both plans and the specific amount of benefitsavailable to healy under each plan he told golden that healy already hadreceived the first installment under each plan mcconnells testimony issupported by the contemporaneous notes he wrote in the margin of the draftnot waiving continuing pension benefits  years and profitsharing earlyretirement mcconnell further testified that although he did not specify theplans by name when he first proposed an exception to the general release heidentified both plans by name to golden in a later conversation relating to the
