skills program provides a single resource for advanced explosive ordnance disposal and tactical operations training courses provided can be custom tailored to fulfill numerous special operations requirements courses combine advanced eod skills with tactical applications to support eod integration into all special operations communities the result of each course is to develop the skill sets needed to plan support and conduct eod operations in highly complex environments courses are designed to fulfill requirements for all special operations communities to include confirm and id intelligence collection and safe practices during assault operations all courses have been developed from the ground up by experienced explosive ordnance disposal and special forces personnel with the needs of the operator in mind the courses are taught by operators for operators with an emphasis on knowledge and skill sets that can be used downrange and in mission planning course format when possible all courses are built on a crawlwalkrun model beginning with classroom lectures followed by handson practical exercises in each topic and finishing with a culminating exercise in which the students are required to use the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course the course structures a low studenttoinstructor ratio which ensures maximum student comprehension and safety training locations courses offered by nek services are available at our training locations in colorado as well as at mobile training team mtt courses at clientselected locations our colorado facilities offer the client a choice of a more remote location with inclusive onsite messing and berthing or a more central location near colorado springs both training campuses have fully equipped

introductory level lecturebased training course designed to enable students to recognize and safely operate in an environment involving a clandestine home made explosives hme manufacturing laboratory the course is applicable for all members of the first responder community in support of health and safety objectives course overview basic explosive theory and associated chemistry overview of the worldwide ied threat with a focus on current trends precursor chemicals required in the hme manufacturing process hazards and handling precautions highthreat home made explosives hme lab recognition this course can be easily combined with other lecturebased clandestine laboratory courses to provide continuing or advanced education for first responders course duration  day hme level ii clandestine laboratory course learn more › the nek services fiveday hme level ii clandestine lab course combines instructorled demonstrations of hme synthesis and their explosive capabilities for an enhanced understanding of their associated hazards and methods needed to effectively and safely prosecute clandestine hme laboratories the course is intended to safely allow students to experience the sights and smells of an hme lab without performing actual handson synthesis the course is applicable for all special operations members and first responders who might be required to work in an environment involving a clandestine home made explosives hme manufacturing laboratory in the course of their duties course overview classroom lecture on basic principles of fires and explosions including explosive theory and associated chemistry overview of the worldwide ied threats with a focus on current trends introduction to precursor chemicals required in the hme manufacturing process introduction to hme production instructors synthesize and detonate the compounds to demonstrate their relative effective power capabilities and limitations the final module discusses how to recognize an hme lab and how to differentiate between an hme lab other nefarious activities and legitimate commercial use of precursor chemicals sensitive site exploitation the course is based on operationallyproven tactics techniques and procedures and will produce welltrained graduates who are ready to operate safely in an hme environment students do not actually synthesize energetic materials during this course the course can also be tailored to incorporate khandler training by accommodating imprinting and searching operations using synthesized hme course duration  days hme level iii learn more › the nek services fiveday hme level iii lab course provides a full sensory experience with respect to the production and use of home made explosives hme it is designed for personnel who will directly encounter hme and hme labs including military explosive ordnance disposal eod and special operations team members civilian law enforcement bomb squads and swat team members classroom instruction combined with practical handson training ensures students leave the course with a comprehensive knowledge of hme manufacture processes the students learn are regularly updated to reflect current techniques and procedures used by terrorist and insurgent organizations across the globe key skills students will gain in the course include learning the basic chemistry and hazards involved in hme manufacture knowing how to identify and safely handle hme and precursor chemicals understanding a wide range of common manufacturing processes nek services level iii hme course offers valuable features designed to enhance the learning experience low studenttoinstructor ratios to ensure safety and maximize handson learning focus on the most commonly encountered enemy hmeie compounds and mixtures and introduce some lesser known energetic materials students synthesize their own hme materials including low explosives primary and secondary high explosives and improvised detonators students conduct analytical sensitivity and livefire testing of the products they produce to reinforce understanding studentmanufactured explosives are tested in various configurations including shaped charges against multiple materials to demonstrate relative effectiveness the proper identification of hme materials and precursor chemicals is the key to operating safely within an hme environment in addition to manufacturing hme and associated components students will learn stateoftheart tools and techniques available to properly identify explosive hazards throughout the course students are encouraged to analyze the precursors and products this portion of the course entails the following proper sampling and analysis of hme materials and unknown chemical precursors utilizing raman spectroscopy fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and chemical reagent test kits field sensitivity testing of explosive compounds including friction static flame and impact to facilitate this portion of the training our course is fully supported by field forensics ahura scientific and smiths detection these companies provide instruction and furnish equipment for the students to
