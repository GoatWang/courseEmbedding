sheetmar   the fund the funds investment objective is total return the fund seeks its objective by investing in a core portfolio generally comprised of an approximately equal mix of equity securities and cash equivalents the funds equity investments will generally consi st of a diversified portfolio of common stocks that seeks to approximate the pretax total return performance of the sp ® index the funds cash equivalent investments consist primarily of us treasury securities with a maximum remaining maturity of one year the fund will write sell call options on the sp ® index on substantially the full value of the funds equity securities and write sell put options on the sp ® index on substantially the full value of the funds cash equi valent holdings the approach the fund uses a disciplined implementation process that adapts to changing market volatility without the need for market timing or forecasts by investing in a core portfolio of equity securities and cash equivalents the fund creates implicit downside pr otection and partially exchanges the future possible gains from equities for the volatility risk premium the income generated from option sales may offset the equity risk premium foregone the features the fund is designed to capitalize on the tendency for volatility priced into an option to be higher on average than the volatility actually experienced on the securities underlying the option through the systematic sale of equity index options inves tors may harvest the volatility risk premium without the use of leverage and market forecasts parametrics research has identified the volatility risk premium as a distinct and persistent return stream overviewsp  index options have traded with positive volatility risk premium vrp over  of the time
