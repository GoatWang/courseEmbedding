companies scientific researchers and energy companies exploring for natural resources employees  including roughly  in hillsboro revenue   million down  percent profits  million up from  million in  another of oregons big corporations sold friday with hillsboro electron microscope company fei co agreeing to sell its business to massachusettsbased thermo fisher scientific for  billion in cash at  per share in cash the sale represents a roughly  percent premium over feis share price thursday its the secondbiggest sale of an oregon tech company in history following last years deal for triquint semiconductor which was valued at  billion this is one that had been rumored for a couple quarters and that actually helped the stock quite a bit said thomas diffely a senior research analyst who follows fei for da davidson in lake oswego fei shares already had climbed  percent this year and jumped to  at fridays close slightly above thermo fishers offer price that suggests there could be other suitors diffely said perhaps including electronics instruments company agilent or perhaps semiconductor equipment company applied materials fei sells is microscopes to intel and other chipmakers to oil companies exploring for new resources and to life sciences researchers life sciences are a a hot market according to diffely and thermo fisher is taking advantage of a downturn in the other two segments by acquiring fei now a lot of established long term companies like this have an interest in life sciences diffely said fei has  employees worldwide  historically about  of them worked at its hillsboro headquarters fei refused to comment on the future of its oregon site or work force diffely said administrative and marketing jobs will likely dwindle over time but the core engineering will endure theres a lot of key knowhow there engineering knowhow that you dont want to mess with he said in a memo to employees fei indicates it expects thermo fisher will retain at least some of its workers this transaction is about growth and fei employees will become part of a large and growing company that offers many opportunities for career development and advancement the company wrote in a separate letter to employees fei chief executive don kania told workers to stay focused on your responsibilities fei told workers it hasnt determined what will happen to its executive team or brand name following the deal the deal triggers a big payday for feis top executives including  million for kania and more than  million for the hillsboro companys new chief financial officer  founded in  fei makes extremely highpowered electron microscopes for the semiconductor industry scientific researchers oil companies seeking new resources and others who require an extremely closeup view of the world fei history  founded in mcminnville as field electron and ion co by faculty members at linfield and the oregon graduate center later the oregon graduate institute  moves to hillsboro  initial public offering begins trading on nasdaq  sells a  percent stake in the business to philips electronics  fei agrees to sell to a new york company veeco instruments and move its headquarters there it was a  billion deal when it was announced but each companys stock slid on the news and so they called off their combination  fei calls off plans to sell to a german company carl zeiss after word leaks out about a pending deal it hires don kania veecos chief operating officer to be ceo  fei buys french software company visualization sciences group for  million after several years of robust growth feis sales fell nearly  percent last year to  million the company has been hurt by the strong us dollar which depressed overseas sales and reduced demand from scientific researchers it had forecast a rebound in  however and its first year of more than  billion in revenue the new owner thermo fisher has annual revenues about  billion and more than  employees its products serve scientific researchers and the medical community the companies said fridays deal will expand thermo fishers product line with fei microscopes complementing the new owners mass spectrometry products and will give thermo fisher a consistent new source of revenue from a business with high profit margins bringing the two companies together will save the businesses about  million annually in the third year after the deal thermo fisher said it hopes to close the deal early next year the sale of fei is the second big deal for an oregon tech company this year in february beavertonbased cascade microtech agreed to a california company called formfactor for  million fei was among the biggest companies remaining in oregon following a  billion selling spree last year even big oregon companies tend to be small by industry standards and in periods of consolidation when interest rates are low and the economy is high for example the states businesses are more likely to be sellers than buyers note this article
