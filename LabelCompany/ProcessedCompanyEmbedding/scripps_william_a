science of complex natural product total synthesis defined the frontiers of organic chemistry throughout these decades fundamental insights into reactivity and selectivity principles were achieved by these numerous synthetic endeavors the capability and power of organic synthesis has thus experienced a dramatic increase putting today’s synthetic chemists in the position to construct molecules of more or less any degree of structural complexity the perception defining “art” in organic synthesis has therefore changed with time and in our opinion is described best by hendrickson when he addressed the “ideal synthesis” as one which “…creates a complex molecule… in a sequence of only construction reactions involving no intermediary refunctionalizations and leading directly to the target not only its skeleton but also its correctly placed functionality” hendrickson jb j am chem soc 9 9  this prescient statement truly encompasses and epitomizes the “economies” of synthesis design many years before ideas of atom step and redoxeconomy were formally galvanized now in  the field has reached an aweinspiring level with many proclaiming that synthesis has matured but before one declares the science of synthesis an endeavor in engineering one only needs to reflect on the inspiring ease with which nature crafts large quantities of her most complex molecules eg vancomycin and taxol total synthesis in this century must therefore be keenly aware of this ultimate challenge – to be able to provide large quantities of complex natural products with a minimum amount of labor and material expenses the natural consequence of pursuing such a goal is to embrace the hendrickson dictum vide supra pursuing synthesis in such a way forces the practitioner into the role of an inventor it naturally also leads to explorations into biology since multiple collaborations can be forged with ample materials education bs chemistry new york university  phd chemistry the scripps

summary marine natural products drug discovery dr gerwicks research focuses on exploring the unique natural products of marine algae and cyanobacteria for useful biomedical properties these chemically prolific organisms are sources of numerous highly unusual metabolites and the gerwick group has been involved in their discovery and evaluation in the areas of cancer inflammation infectious disease including tropical diseases such as malaria chagasâ disease leishmaniasis neurochemical pathways as well as agricultural uses the gerwick group has also examined the pathways of biosynthesis of many of the compounds they have discovered over the years and pioneered the characterization of their origins at the molecular genetic and genomic levels more recently his group has also applied their chemical and genetic approaches to the goal of obtaining biofuels from cultured microalgae dr gerwicks group uses scuba to collect marine samples from around the world such as panama madagascar and papua new guinea and grows many of these life forms in the laboratory in la jolla extracts of these organisms are tested for bioactivity and the active compounds are isolated and structures defined using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and mass spectrometry ms highly interesting metabolites are developed through collaboration with academic and industrial researchers and biosynthetic pathways

died in 9 estateedit see also scripps mansion in 9 he began purchasing large tracts of farmland in lake orion michigan with an ambition to raise livestock and show animals including angus cattle swine cows and poultry the estate called wildwood farms grew in size to  acres  km in the mid9s scripps hired his brotherinlaw architect clarence e day to build a new home for his family on the northwest quadrant of the property scripps mansion a magnificent norman and tudor style dwelling was completed in 9 it has served as a guest house and retreat center for the catholic church since the 9s and is

bradley jensen paul funding agency  national institute of general medical sciences proposal abstract  bacteria belonging to the order actinomycetales commonly called actinomycetes account for  approximately  of the microbial natural products used in human therapy while major  pharmaceutical companies have moved en masse away from natural products as a resource for small molecule drug discovery it has recently become recognized that actinomycetes derived  from marine sources represent an important new source of structurally diverse natural products  in particular marine actinomycetes belonging to the genus salinispora have proven to be a rich  source of biologically active secondary metabolites including salinosporamide a which recently  completed phase i clinical trials for the treatment of cancer the compounds produced by this  chemically prolific genus span virtually all known biosynthetic classes and have led to the  characterization of a growing number of unprecedented biosynthetic paradigms after more than  two decades of extensive marine sampling we have amassed a collection of more that  diverse salinispora strains this collection provides unprecedented opportunities to further explore the biosynthetic potential of this extraordinary taxon and to address fundamental questions about mechanistic biochemistry and the evolutionary processes that generate new structural diversity here we propose the continuation of a genomemining project that was initiated less than four years ago to analyze six salinispora genome sequences    this renewal application builds upon the productive collaboration established between the moore biosynthesisgenome mining jensen bioinformaticsmicrobiology and william fenical natural product chemistry laboratories in this renewal we specifically address five major aims  the bioinformatic analysis of  salinispora genome sequences  the genome guided isolation and characterization of new biologically active salinispora natural products  the expression of salinispora biosynthetic gene clusters by transformationassociated recombination cloning  the activation of ‘silent’ biosynthetic pathways by regulatory manipulation and  the biosynthetic analysis of the salinispora mtor inhibitor lymphostin these aims address fundamentally important questions related to the diversity and distributions of secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways in a welldefined taxon and the evolutionary processes that generate new small molecule diversity   start and end date  august 9 to july  natural products
