of  and  many banksnote  filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance in  william jennings bryan presented a bill to congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund no action was taken as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time after  eight states established deposit insurance funds due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch small local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers especially in the western and southern states in  there were about  banks in the us the federal reserve act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance but it was removed from the bill by the house of representatives from  to the fdics creation in   bills were submitted in congress proposing deposit insurance the great depression devastated the american banking system there was widespread panic over the american banking system in the years before the fdics creation more than onethird of all banks failed due to bank runs small banks in rural areas were especially affected reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors fears many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearlyinsolvent banks establishment of the fdic edit president franklin d roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits saying we do not wish to make the united states government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks and put a premium on unsound banking in the future but public support was overwhelmingly in favor and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero on  june  roosevelt signed the  banking act into law creating the fdic the initial plan set by congress in  was to insure deposits up to   today adopting of a more generous longterm plan after six monthsnote  however the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to   today president franklin delano roosevelt signs the banking act of  the  banking act established the fdic as a temporary government corporation the banking act of  made the fdic a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the  level gave the fdic authority to provide deposit insurance to banks gave the fdic the authority to regulate and supervise state nonmember banks funded the fdic with initial loans of  million through the us treasury and the federal reserve which were later paid back with interest extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time separated commercial and investment banking glass–steagall act prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts allowed national banks to branch statewide if allowed by state law historical insurance limitsedit  –   –   –   –   –   –   –   –  congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from  to  which was effective from october   through december   on may   the temporary increase was extended through december   however the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act pl which was signed into law on july   made the  insurance limit permanent in addition the federal deposit insurance reform act of  pl allows for the boards of the fdic and the national credit union administration ncua to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in  and if warranted to adjust the amounts under a specified formula sl and bank crisis of the sedit main article savings and loan crisis federal deposit insurance received its first largescale test since the great depression in the late s and early s during the savings and loan crisis which also affected commercial banks and savings banks the brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic created to insure savings and loan sl institutions sls also called thrifts because of a confluence of events much of the sl industry was insolvent and many large banks were in trouble as well the fslic became insolvent and was abolished in august  it was replaced by the resolution trust corporation rtc on december   the rtc was merged into the fdic and the fdic became responsible for resolving failed thrifts supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency the office of thrift supervision credit unions remained insured by the national credit union administration the primary legislative responses to the crisis were the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  firrea and federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  fdicia federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and statechartered thrifts by the fdic final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of fslic and rtc resolutions was an estimated  billion of this total amount us taxpayer losses amounted to approximately  billion  of the total costs no taxpayer money was used to resolve fdicinsured institutions – financial crisisedit further information – global financial crisis edit in  twentyfive us banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority however during that year the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on september   when washington mutual with  billion in assets experienced a day bank run on its deposits the fdic created the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks thrifts and certain holding companies and by providing full coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts regardless of dollar amount the deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from  to  edit on august   bloomberg reported that more than  publicly traded us lenders had nonperforming loans above  of their total holdings this is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a banks equity and threaten its survival while this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt it is an important indicator for future fdic activity on august   guaranty bank in texas became insolvent and was taken over by bbva compass the us division of banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria the secondlargest bank in spain this was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of  and  in addition the fdic agreed to share losses with bbva on about  billion of guaranty banks loans and other assets this transaction alone cost the fdic deposit insurance fund  billion on august   the fdic increased the number of troubled banks to  in the second quarter that number compares to  just three months earlier at the end of the third quarter that number jumped to  at the close of  a total of  banks had become insolvent this is the largest number of bank failures in a year since  when  institutions failed edit on february   fdic chairman sheila bair warned that the number of failures in  could surpass the  banks that were seized in  commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in  on april   the fdic was appointed as receiver for three banks in puerto rico at a cost of  billion in   banks with approximately  billion in total assets failed in  a new division within the fdic the office of complex financial institutions was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the fdic by the doddfrank act for the assessment of risk in the largest systemically important financial institutions or sifis its current director is james wigand in june  wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director fundsedit former fundsedit between  and  there were two separate fdic funds – the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif the latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the s the existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks attempting to shift from one fund to another depending on the benefits each could provide in the s saif premiums were at one point five times higher than bif premiums several banks attempted to qualify for the bif with some merging with institutions qualified for the bif to avoid the higher premiums of the saif this drove up the bif premiums as well resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary then chairman of the federal reserve alan greenspan was a critic of the system saying we are in effect attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely governmentmandated deposit insurance such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference greenspan proposed to end this game and merge saif and bif deposit insurance fundedit in february  president george w bush signed into law the federal deposit insurance reform act of  fdira and a related conforming amendments act the fdira contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform as well as a number of study and survey requirements among the highlights of this law was merging the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif into a new fund the deposit insurance fund dif this change was made effective march   the fdic maintains the dif by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium the amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund bank failures typically represent a cost to the dif because the fdic as receiver of the failed institution must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while at the same time making good on the institutions deposit obligations bond interest payments of the financing corporation the funding vehicle for the resolution fund of the now defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic are funded by dif premiums a march  memorandum to the fdic board of directors shows a  yearend deposit insurance fund balance of about  billion which represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion the  yearend insured deposits were projected to reach about  trillion with the reserve growing to  billion a ratio of  as of june  the dif had a balance of  billion however  months later in march  the dif fell to  billion that was the lowest total since september  and represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion in the second quarter of  the fdic imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising  billion to replenish the dif however saxo bank research reported that after aug  further bank failures had reduced the dif balance to  million fdicestimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on aug  exceeded that amountcitation needed the fdic announced its intent on september   to assess the banks in advance for three years of premiums in an effort to avoid dif insolvency the fdic revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about  billion over the next four years an increase of  billion from the  billion estimate of earlier in  the fdic board voted to require insured banks to prepay  billion in premiums to replenish the fund news media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the fdic insurance fund the fdic elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years instead of drawing down banks statutory capital abruptly at the time of the assessment the fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to  percent of insured deposits as of june   the insured banks held approximately  billion in total deposits though not all of those are insured as of september   total deposits at fdicinsured institutions totaled roughly  trillion although not all deposits are insured the difs reserves are not the only cash resources available to the fdic in addition to  billion of cash and us treasury securities held as of march  the fdic has the ability to borrow up to  billion from the treasury the fdic can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of  full faith and creditedit in light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system the adequacy of fdics financial backing has come into question according to the fdicgov website as of march  fdic deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government this means that the resources of the united states government stand behind fdicinsured depositors the statutory basis for this assertion is unclear however congress in  passed

level in  yearsneeds update resolution of insolvent banksedit a banks chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the us office of the comptroller of the currency—closes a bank and appoints the fdic as receiver in its role as a receiver the fdic is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution the fdic does not close banks the fdic as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the fdic acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer and the fdic as receiver has separate rights duties and obligations from those of the fdic as insurer courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities in  to comply with legislation the fdic amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds the procedures require the fdic to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution bids are submitted to the fdic where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made a receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution liquidate them and distribute the proceeds to the institutions creditors the fdic as receiver succeeds to the rights powers and privileges of the institution and its stockholders officers and directors the fdic may collect all obligations and money due to the institution preserve or liquidate its assets and property and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment a receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency court or party with contractual rights furthermore a receiver may form a new institution such as a bridge bank to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the fdic in its corporate capacity the two most common ways for the fdic to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are purchase and assumption agreement pa in which deposits liabilities are assumed by an open bank which also purchases some or all of the failed banks loans assets the banks assets that convey to the fdic as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods including online and using contractors deposit payoff as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift the fdic is appointed receiver the fdic as insurer pays all of the failed institutions depositors with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors such as suppliers and service providers of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement instead the fdic as receiver issues them receivership certificates a receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receivers collections on the failed institutions assets covered insured depository institutions resolution plansedit to assist the fdic in resolving an insolvent bank the fdic requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the dodd frank act in addition to the bank holding company bhc resolution plans required under the dodd frank act under section d the fdic requires a separate covered insured depository institution cidi resolution plan for us insured depositories with assets of  billion or more most of the largest most complex bhcs are subject to both rules requiring them to file a d resolution plan for the bhc that includes the bhcs core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries ie material entities as well as one or more cidi plans depending on the number of us bank subsidiaries of the bhc that meet the  billion asset threshold on december  the fdic issued guidance for the  resolution plans of cidis of large bank holding companies bhcs the guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the cidi resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the  cidi resolution plans including the assumption that the cidi must fail the cause of cidi failure must be a core business loss or impairment at least one multiple acquirer strategy is required in the plan a deep level of granularity is expected in the plan sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail a detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed key legal issues must be considered resolution obstacles must be addressed the cidi must be insolvent at the start of resolution insured productsedit example of fdic insurance coverage fdic deposit insurance covers deposit accounts which by the fdic definition include demand deposits checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts now accounts ie savings accounts that have checkwriting privileges savings accounts and money market deposit accounts mmdas ie higherinterest savings accounts subject to checkwriting restrictions time deposits including certificates of deposit cds outstanding cashiers checks interest checks and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank accounts denominated in foreign currencies accounts at different banks are insured separately all branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank also an internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank even if the name differs nonus citizens are also covered by fdic insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an fdicinsured bank the fdic publishes a guide entitled your insured deposits which sets forth the general characteristics of fdic deposit insurance and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance items not insurededit only the above types of accounts are insured some types of uninsured products even if purchased through a covered financial institution are stocks bonds and mutual funds including money funds the securities investor protection corporation a separate institution chartered by congress provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure but not against losses on the investments further as of september   the united states treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds which guarantees the value of the assets exceptions have occurred such as the fdic bailout of bondholders of continental illinois investments backed by the us government such as treasury securities the contents of safe deposit boxes even though the word deposit appears in the name under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer losses due to theft or fraud at the institution these situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking

insurance fund no action was taken as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time after  eight states established deposit insurance funds due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch small local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers especially in the western and southern states in  there were about  banks in the us the federal reserve act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance but it was removed from the bill by the house of representatives from  to the fdics creation in   bills were submitted in congress proposing deposit insurance the great depression devastated the american banking system there was widespread panic over the american banking system in the years before the fdics creation more than onethird of all banks failed due to bank runs small banks in rural areas were especially affected reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors fears many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearlyinsolvent banks establishment of the fdic edit president franklin d roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits saying we do not wish to make the united states government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks and put a premium on unsound banking in the future but public support was overwhelmingly in favor and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero on  june  roosevelt signed the  banking act into law creating the fdic the initial plan set by congress in  was to insure deposits up to   today adopting of a more generous longterm plan after six monthsnote  however the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to   today president franklin delano roosevelt signs the banking act of  the  banking act established the fdic as a temporary government corporation the banking act of  made the fdic a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the  level gave the fdic authority to provide deposit insurance to banks gave the fdic the authority to regulate and supervise state nonmember banks funded

addition the federal deposit insurance reform act of  pl allows for the boards of the fdic and the national credit union administration ncua to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in  and if warranted to adjust the amounts under a specified formula sl and bank crisis of the sedit main article savings and loan crisis federal deposit insurance received its first largescale test since the great depression in the late s and early s during the savings and loan crisis which also affected commercial banks and savings banks the brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic created to insure savings and loan sl institutions sls also called thrifts because of a confluence of events much of the sl industry was insolvent and many large banks were in trouble as well the fslic became insolvent and was abolished in august  it was replaced by the resolution trust corporation rtc on december   the rtc was merged into the fdic and the fdic became responsible for resolving failed thrifts supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency the office of thrift supervision credit unions remained insured by the national credit union administration the primary legislative responses to the crisis were the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  firrea and federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  fdicia federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and statechartered thrifts by the fdic final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of fslic and rtc resolutions was an estimated  billion of this total amount us taxpayer losses amounted to approximately  billion  of the total costs no taxpayer money was used to resolve fdicinsured institutions – financial crisisedit further information – global financial crisis edit in  twentyfive us banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority however during that year the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on september   when washington mutual with  billion in assets experienced a day bank run on its deposits the fdic created the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks thrifts and certain holding companies and by providing full coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts regardless of dollar amount the deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from  to  edit on august   bloomberg reported that more than  publicly traded us lenders had nonperforming loans above  of their total holdings this is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a banks equity and threaten its survival while this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt it is an important indicator for future fdic activity on august   guaranty bank in texas became insolvent and was taken over by bbva compass the us division of banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria the secondlargest bank in spain this was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of  and  in addition the fdic agreed to share losses with bbva on about  billion of guaranty banks loans and other assets this transaction alone cost the fdic deposit insurance fund  billion on august   the fdic increased the number of troubled banks to  in the second quarter that number compares to  just three months earlier at the end of the third quarter that number jumped to  at the close of  a total of  banks had become insolvent this is the largest number of bank failures in a year since  when  institutions failed edit on february   fdic chairman sheila bair warned that the number of failures in  could surpass the  banks that were seized in  commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in  on april   the fdic was appointed as receiver for three banks in puerto rico at a cost of  billion in   banks with approximately  billion in total assets failed in  a new division within the fdic the office of complex financial institutions was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the fdic by the doddfrank act for the assessment of risk in the largest systemically important financial institutions or sifis its current director is james wigand in june  wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director fundsedit former fundsedit between  and  there were two separate fdic funds – the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif the latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the s the existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks attempting to shift from one fund to another depending on the benefits each could provide in the s saif premiums were at one point five times higher than bif premiums several banks attempted to qualify for the bif with some merging with institutions qualified for the bif to avoid the higher premiums of the saif this drove up the bif premiums as well resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary then chairman of the federal reserve alan greenspan was a critic of the system saying we are in effect attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely governmentmandated deposit insurance such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference greenspan proposed to end this game and merge saif and bif deposit insurance fundedit in february  president george w bush signed into law the federal deposit insurance reform act of  fdira and a related conforming amendments act the fdira contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform as well as a number of study and survey requirements among the highlights of this law was merging the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif into a new fund the deposit insurance fund dif this change was made effective march   the fdic maintains the dif by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium the amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund bank failures typically represent a cost to the dif because the fdic as receiver of the failed institution must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while at the same time making good on the institutions deposit obligations bond interest payments of the financing corporation the funding vehicle for the resolution fund of the now defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic are funded by dif premiums a march  memorandum to the fdic board of directors shows a  yearend deposit insurance fund balance of about  billion which represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion the  yearend insured deposits were projected to reach about  trillion with the reserve growing to  billion a ratio of  as of june  the dif had a balance of  billion however  months later in march  the dif fell to  billion that was the lowest total since september  and represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion in the second quarter of  the fdic imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising  billion to replenish the dif however saxo bank research reported that after aug  further bank failures had reduced the dif balance to  million fdicestimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on aug  exceeded that amountcitation needed the fdic announced its intent on september   to assess the banks in advance for three years of premiums in an effort to avoid dif insolvency the fdic revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about  billion over the next four years an increase of  billion from the  billion estimate of earlier in  the fdic board voted to require insured banks to prepay  billion in premiums to replenish the fund news media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the fdic insurance fund the fdic elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years instead of drawing down banks statutory capital abruptly at the time of the assessment the fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to  percent of insured deposits as of june   the insured banks held approximately  billion in total deposits though not all of those are insured as of september   total deposits at fdicinsured institutions totaled roughly  trillion although not all deposits are insured the difs reserves are not the only cash resources available to the fdic in addition to  billion of cash and us treasury securities held as of march  the fdic has the ability to borrow up to  billion from the treasury the fdic can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of  full faith and creditedit in light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system the adequacy of fdics financial backing has come into question according to the fdicgov website as of march  fdic deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government this means that the resources of the united states government stand behind fdicinsured depositors the statutory basis for this assertion is unclear however congress in  passed a sense of congress to that effect but such enactments do not carry the force of law insurance requirementsedit to receive this benefit member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements banks

resolution of insolvent banksedit a banks chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the us office of the comptroller of the currency—closes a bank and appoints the fdic as receiver in its role as a receiver the fdic is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution the fdic does not close banks the fdic as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the fdic acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer and the fdic as receiver has separate rights duties and obligations from those of the fdic as insurer courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities in  to comply with legislation the fdic amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds the procedures require the fdic to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution bids are submitted to the fdic where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made a receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution liquidate them and distribute the proceeds to the institutions creditors the fdic as receiver succeeds to the rights powers and privileges of the institution and its stockholders officers and directors the fdic may collect all obligations and money due to the institution preserve or liquidate its assets and property and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment a receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency court or party with contractual rights furthermore a receiver may form a new institution such as a bridge bank to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the fdic in its corporate capacity the two most common ways for the fdic to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are purchase and assumption agreement pa in which deposits liabilities are assumed by an open bank which also purchases some or all of the failed banks loans assets the banks assets that convey to the fdic as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods including online and using contractors deposit payoff as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift the fdic is appointed receiver the fdic as insurer pays all of the failed institutions depositors with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors such as suppliers and service providers of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement instead the fdic as receiver issues them receivership certificates a receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receivers collections on the failed institutions assets covered insured depository institutions resolution plansedit to assist the fdic in resolving an insolvent bank the fdic requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the dodd frank act in addition to the bank holding company bhc resolution plans required under the dodd frank act under section d the fdic requires a separate covered insured depository institution cidi resolution plan for us insured depositories with assets of  billion or more most of the largest most complex bhcs are subject to both rules requiring them to file a d resolution plan for the bhc that includes the bhcs core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries ie material entities as well as one or more cidi plans depending on the number of us bank subsidiaries of the bhc that meet the  billion asset threshold on december  the fdic issued guidance for the  resolution plans of cidis of large bank holding companies bhcs the guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the cidi resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the  cidi resolution plans including the assumption that the cidi must fail the cause of cidi failure must be a core business loss or impairment at least one multiple acquirer strategy is required in the plan a deep level of granularity is expected in the plan sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail a detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed key legal issues must be considered resolution obstacles must be addressed the cidi must be insolvent at the start of resolution insured productsedit example of fdic insurance coverage fdic deposit insurance covers deposit accounts which by the fdic definition include demand deposits checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts now accounts ie savings accounts that have checkwriting privileges savings accounts and money market deposit accounts mmdas ie higherinterest savings accounts subject to checkwriting restrictions time deposits including certificates of deposit cds outstanding cashiers checks interest checks and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank accounts denominated in foreign currencies accounts at different banks are insured separately all branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank also an internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank even if the name differs nonus citizens are also covered by fdic insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an fdicinsured bank the fdic publishes a guide entitled your insured deposits which sets forth the general characteristics of fdic deposit insurance and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance items not insurededit only the above types of accounts are insured some types of uninsured products even if purchased through a covered financial institution are stocks bonds and mutual funds including money funds the securities investor protection corporation a separate institution chartered by congress provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure but not against losses on the investments further as of september   the united states treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds which guarantees the value of the assets exceptions have occurred such as the fdic bailout of bondholders of continental illinois investments backed by the us government such as treasury securities the contents of safe deposit boxes even though the word deposit appears in the name under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer losses due to theft or fraud at the institution these situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking institutions buy from private insurance

insurance fund no action was taken as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time after  eight states established deposit insurance funds due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch small local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers especially in the western and southern states in  there were about  banks in the us the federal reserve act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance but it was removed from the bill by the house of representatives from  to the fdics creation in   bills were submitted in congress proposing deposit insurance the great depression devastated the american banking system there was widespread panic over the american banking system in the years before the fdics creation more than onethird of all banks failed due to bank runs small banks in rural areas were especially affected reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors fears many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearlyinsolvent banks establishment of the fdic edit president franklin d roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits saying we do not wish to make the united states government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks and put a premium on unsound banking in the future but public support was overwhelmingly in favor and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero on  june  roosevelt signed the  banking act into law creating the fdic the initial plan set by congress in  was to insure deposits up to   today adopting of a more generous longterm plan after six monthsnote  however the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to   today president franklin delano roosevelt signs the banking act of  the  banking act established the fdic as a temporary government corporation the banking act of  made the fdic a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the  level gave the fdic authority to provide deposit insurance to banks gave the fdic the authority to regulate and supervise state nonmember banks funded

addition the federal deposit insurance reform act of  pl allows for the boards of the fdic and the national credit union administration ncua to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in  and if warranted to adjust the amounts under a specified formula sl and bank crisis of the sedit main article savings and loan crisis federal deposit insurance received its first largescale test since the great depression in the late s and early s during the savings and loan crisis which also affected commercial banks and savings banks the brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic created to insure savings and loan sl institutions sls also called thrifts because of a confluence of events much of the sl industry was insolvent and many large banks were in trouble as well the fslic became insolvent and was abolished in august  it was replaced by the resolution trust corporation rtc on december   the rtc was merged into the fdic and the fdic became responsible for resolving failed thrifts supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency the office of thrift supervision credit unions remained insured by the national credit union administration the primary legislative responses to the crisis were the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  firrea and federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  fdicia federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and statechartered thrifts by the fdic final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of fslic and rtc resolutions was an estimated  billion of this total amount us taxpayer losses amounted to approximately  billion  of the total costs no taxpayer money was used to resolve fdicinsured institutions – financial crisisedit further information – global financial crisis edit in  twentyfive us banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority however during that year the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on september   when washington mutual with  billion in assets experienced a day bank run on its deposits the fdic created the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks thrifts and certain holding companies and by providing full coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts regardless of dollar amount the deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from  to  edit on august   bloomberg reported that more than  publicly traded us lenders had nonperforming loans above  of their total holdings this is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a banks equity and threaten its survival while this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt it is an important indicator for future fdic activity on august   guaranty bank in texas became insolvent and was taken over by bbva compass the us division of banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria the secondlargest bank in spain this was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of  and  in addition the fdic agreed to share losses with bbva on about  billion of guaranty banks loans and other assets this transaction alone cost the fdic deposit insurance fund  billion on august   the fdic increased the number of troubled banks to  in the second quarter that number compares to  just three months earlier at the end of the third quarter that number jumped to  at the close of  a total of  banks had become insolvent this is the largest number of bank failures in a year since  when  institutions failed edit on february   fdic chairman sheila bair warned that the number of failures in  could surpass the  banks that were seized in  commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in  on april   the fdic was appointed as receiver for three banks in puerto rico at a cost of  billion in   banks with approximately  billion in total assets failed in  a new division within the fdic the office of complex financial institutions was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the fdic by the doddfrank act for the assessment of risk in the largest systemically important financial institutions or sifis its current director is james wigand in june  wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director fundsedit former fundsedit between  and  there were two separate fdic funds – the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif the latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the s the existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks attempting to shift from one fund to another depending on the benefits each could provide in the s saif premiums were at one point five times higher than bif premiums several banks attempted to qualify for the bif with some merging with institutions qualified for the bif to avoid the higher premiums of the saif this drove up the bif premiums as well resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary then chairman of the federal reserve alan greenspan was a critic of the system saying we are in effect attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely governmentmandated deposit insurance such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference greenspan proposed to end this game and merge saif and bif deposit insurance fundedit in february  president george w bush signed into law the federal deposit insurance reform act of  fdira and a related conforming amendments act the fdira contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform as well as a number of study and survey requirements among the highlights of this law was merging the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif into a new fund the deposit insurance fund dif this change was made effective march   the fdic maintains the dif by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium the amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund bank failures typically represent a cost to the dif because the fdic as receiver of the failed institution must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while at the same time making good on the institutions deposit obligations bond interest payments of the financing corporation the funding vehicle for the resolution fund of the now defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic are funded by dif premiums a march  memorandum to the fdic board of directors shows a  yearend deposit insurance fund balance of about  billion which represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion the  yearend insured deposits were projected to reach about  trillion with the reserve growing to  billion a ratio of  as of june  the dif had a balance of  billion however  months later in march  the dif fell to  billion that was the lowest total since september  and represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion in the second quarter of  the fdic imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising  billion to replenish the dif however saxo bank research reported that after aug  further bank failures had reduced the dif balance to  million fdicestimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on aug  exceeded that amountcitation needed the fdic announced its intent on september   to assess the banks in advance for three years of premiums in an effort to avoid dif insolvency the fdic revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about  billion over the next four years an increase of  billion from the  billion estimate of earlier in  the fdic board voted to require insured banks to prepay  billion in premiums to replenish the fund news media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the fdic insurance fund the fdic elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years instead of drawing down banks statutory capital abruptly at the time of the assessment the fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to  percent of insured deposits as of june   the insured banks held approximately  billion in total deposits though not all of those are insured as of september   total deposits at fdicinsured institutions totaled roughly  trillion although not all deposits are insured the difs reserves are not the only cash resources available to the fdic in addition to  billion of cash and us treasury securities held as of march  the fdic has the ability to borrow up to  billion from the treasury the fdic can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of  full faith and creditedit in light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system the adequacy of fdics financial backing has come into question according to the fdicgov website as of march  fdic deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government this means that the resources of the united states government stand behind fdicinsured depositors the statutory basis for this assertion is unclear however congress in  passed a sense of congress to that effect but such enactments do not carry the force of law insurance requirementsedit to receive this benefit member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements banks are classified in five groups according to their riskbased capital ratio well capitalized  or higher adequately capitalized  or higher undercapitalized less than  significantly undercapitalized less

contractual rights furthermore a receiver may form a new institution such as a bridge bank to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution or it may sell or pledge the assets of the

filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance in  william jennings bryan presented a bill to congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund no action was taken as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time after  eight states established deposit insurance funds due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch small local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers especially in the western and southern states in  there were about  banks in the us the federal reserve act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance but it was removed from the bill by the house of representatives from  to the fdics creation in   bills were submitted in congress proposing deposit insurance the great depression devastated the american banking system there was widespread panic over the american banking system in the years before the fdics creation more than onethird of all banks failed due to bank runs small banks in rural areas were especially affected reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors fears many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearlyinsolvent banks establishment of the fdic edit president franklin d roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits saying we do not wish to make the united states government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks and put a premium on unsound banking in the future but public support was overwhelmingly in favor and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero on  june  roosevelt signed the  banking act into law creating the fdic the initial plan set by congress in  was to insure deposits up to   today adopting of a more generous longterm plan after six monthsnote  however the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to   today president franklin delano roosevelt signs the banking act of  the  banking act established the fdic as a temporary government corporation the banking act of  made the fdic a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the  level gave the fdic authority to provide deposit insurance to banks gave the fdic the authority to regulate and supervise state nonmember banks funded the fdic with initial loans of  million through the us treasury and the federal reserve which were later paid back with interest extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time separated commercial and investment banking glass–steagall act prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts allowed national banks to branch statewide if allowed by state law historical

temporary increase was extended through december   however the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act pl which was signed into law on july   made the  insurance limit permanent in addition the federal deposit insurance reform act of  pl allows for the boards of the fdic and the national credit union administration ncua to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in  and if warranted to adjust the amounts under a specified formula sl and bank crisis of the sedit main article savings and loan crisis federal deposit insurance received its first largescale test since the great depression in the late s and early s during the savings and loan crisis which also affected commercial banks and savings banks the brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic created to insure savings and loan sl institutions sls also called thrifts because of a confluence of events much of the sl industry was insolvent and many large banks were in trouble as well the fslic became insolvent and was abolished in august  it was replaced by the resolution trust corporation rtc on december   the rtc was merged into the fdic and the fdic became responsible for resolving failed thrifts supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency the office of thrift supervision credit unions remained insured by the national credit union administration the primary legislative responses to the crisis were the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  firrea and federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  fdicia federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and statechartered thrifts by the fdic final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of fslic and rtc resolutions was an estimated  billion of this total amount us taxpayer losses amounted to approximately  billion  of the total costs no taxpayer money was used to resolve fdicinsured institutions – financial crisisedit further information – global financial crisis edit in  twentyfive us banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority however during that year the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on september   when washington mutual with  billion in assets experienced a day bank run on its deposits the fdic created the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks thrifts and certain holding companies and by providing full coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts regardless of dollar amount the deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from  to  edit on august   bloomberg reported that more than  publicly traded us lenders had nonperforming loans above  of their total holdings this is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a banks equity and threaten its survival while this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt it is an important indicator for future fdic activity on august   guaranty bank in texas became insolvent and was taken over by bbva compass the us division of banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria the secondlargest bank in spain this was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of  and  in addition the fdic agreed to share losses with bbva on about  billion of guaranty banks loans and other assets this transaction alone cost the fdic deposit insurance fund  billion on august   the fdic increased the number of troubled banks to  in the second quarter that number compares to  just three months earlier at the end of the third quarter that number jumped to  at the close of  a total of  banks had become insolvent this is the largest number of bank failures in a year since  when  institutions failed edit on february   fdic chairman sheila bair warned that the number of failures in  could surpass the  banks that were seized in  commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in  on april   the fdic was appointed as receiver for three banks in puerto rico at a cost of  billion in   banks with approximately  billion in total assets failed in  a new division within the fdic the office of complex financial institutions was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the fdic by the doddfrank act for the assessment of risk in the largest systemically important financial institutions or sifis its current director is james wigand in june  wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director fundsedit former fundsedit between  and  there were two separate fdic funds – the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif the latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the s the existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks attempting to shift from one fund to another depending on the benefits each could provide in the s saif premiums were at one point five times higher than bif premiums several banks attempted to qualify for the bif with some merging with institutions qualified for the bif to avoid the higher premiums of the saif this drove up the bif premiums as well resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary then chairman of the federal reserve alan greenspan was a critic of the system saying we are in effect attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely governmentmandated deposit insurance such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference greenspan proposed to end this game and merge saif and bif deposit insurance fundedit in february  president george w bush signed into law the federal deposit insurance reform act of  fdira and a related conforming amendments act the fdira contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform as well as a number of study and survey requirements among the highlights of this law was merging the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif into a new fund the deposit insurance fund dif this change was made effective march   the fdic maintains the dif by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium the amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund bank failures typically represent a cost to the dif because the fdic as receiver of the failed institution must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while at the same time making good on the institutions deposit obligations bond interest payments of the financing corporation the funding vehicle for the resolution fund of the now defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic are funded by dif premiums a march  memorandum to the fdic board of directors shows a  yearend deposit insurance fund balance of about  billion which represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion the  yearend insured deposits were projected to reach about  trillion with the reserve growing to  billion a ratio of  as of june  the dif had a balance of  billion however  months later in march  the dif fell to  billion that was the lowest total since september  and represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion in the second quarter of  the fdic imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising  billion to replenish the dif however saxo bank research reported that after aug  further bank failures had reduced the dif balance to  million fdicestimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on aug  exceeded that amountcitation needed the fdic announced its intent on september   to assess the banks in advance for three years of premiums in an effort to avoid dif insolvency the fdic revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about  billion over the next four years an increase of  billion from the  billion estimate of earlier in  the fdic board voted to require insured banks to prepay  billion in premiums to replenish the fund news media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the fdic insurance fund the fdic elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years instead of drawing down banks statutory capital abruptly at the time of the assessment the fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to  percent of insured deposits as of june   the insured banks held approximately  billion in total deposits though not all of those are insured as of september   total deposits at fdicinsured institutions totaled roughly  trillion although not all deposits are insured the difs reserves are not the only cash resources available to the fdic in addition to  billion of cash and us treasury securities held as of march  the fdic has the ability to borrow up to  billion from the treasury the fdic can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of  full faith and creditedit in light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system the adequacy of fdics financial backing has come into question according to the fdicgov website as of march  fdic deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government this means that the resources of the united states government stand behind fdicinsured depositors the statutory basis for this assertion is unclear however congress in  passed a sense of congress to that effect but such enactments do not carry the force of law insurance requirementsedit to receive this benefit member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements banks are classified in five groups according to their riskbased capital ratio well capitalized  or higher adequately capitalized  or higher undercapitalized less than  significantly undercapitalized less than  critically undercapitalized less than  when a bank becomes undercapitalized the institutions primary regulator issues a warning to the bank when the number drops below  the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action when the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the fdic as receiver of the bank at q   banks had very low capital cushions against risk and were on the fdics problem list this was nearly  percent of all federally insured banks the highest level in  yearsneeds update resolution of insolvent banksedit a banks chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the us office of the comptroller of the currency—closes a bank and appoints the fdic as receiver in its role as a receiver the fdic is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution the fdic does not close banks the fdic as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the fdic acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer and the fdic as receiver has separate rights duties and obligations from those of the fdic as insurer courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities in  to comply with legislation the fdic amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds the procedures require the fdic to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution bids are submitted to the fdic where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made a receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution liquidate them and distribute the proceeds to the institutions creditors the fdic as receiver succeeds to the rights powers and privileges of the institution and its stockholders officers and directors the fdic may collect all obligations and money due to the institution preserve or liquidate its assets and property and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment a receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency court or party with contractual rights furthermore a receiver may form a new institution such as a bridge bank to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the fdic in its corporate capacity the two most common ways for the fdic to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are purchase and assumption agreement pa in which deposits liabilities are assumed by an open bank which also purchases some or all of the failed banks loans assets the banks assets that convey to the fdic as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods including online and using contractors deposit payoff as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift the fdic is appointed receiver the fdic as insurer pays all of the failed institutions depositors with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors such as suppliers and service providers of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement instead the fdic as receiver issues them receivership certificates a receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receivers collections on the failed institutions assets covered insured depository institutions resolution plansedit to assist the fdic in resolving an insolvent bank the fdic requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the dodd frank act in addition to the bank holding company bhc resolution plans required under the dodd frank act under section d the fdic requires a separate covered insured depository institution cidi resolution plan for us insured depositories with assets of  billion or more most of the largest most complex bhcs are subject to both rules requiring them to file a d resolution plan for the bhc that includes the bhcs core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries ie material entities as well as one or more cidi plans depending on the number of us bank subsidiaries of the bhc that meet the  billion asset threshold on december  the fdic issued guidance for the  resolution plans of cidis of large bank holding companies bhcs the guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the cidi resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the  cidi resolution plans including the assumption that the cidi must fail the cause of cidi failure must be a core business loss or impairment at least one multiple acquirer strategy is required in the plan a deep level of granularity is expected in the plan sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail a detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed key legal issues must be considered resolution obstacles must be addressed the cidi must be insolvent at the start of resolution insured productsedit example of fdic

filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance in  william jennings bryan presented a bill to congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund no action was taken as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time after  eight states established deposit insurance funds due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch small local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers especially in the western and southern states in  there were about  banks in the us the federal reserve act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance but it was removed from the bill by the house of representatives from  to the fdics creation in   bills were submitted in congress proposing deposit insurance the great depression devastated the american banking system there was widespread panic over the american banking system in the years before the fdics creation more than onethird of all banks failed due to bank runs small banks in rural areas were especially affected reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors fears many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearlyinsolvent banks establishment of the fdic edit president franklin d roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits saying we do not wish to make the united states government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks and put a premium on unsound banking in the future but public support was overwhelmingly in favor and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero on  june  roosevelt signed the  banking act into law creating the fdic the initial plan set by congress in  was to insure deposits up to   today adopting of a more generous longterm plan after six monthsnote  however the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to   today president franklin delano roosevelt signs the banking act of  the  banking act established the fdic as a temporary government corporation the banking act of  made the fdic a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the  level gave the fdic authority to provide deposit insurance to banks gave the fdic the authority to regulate and supervise state nonmember banks funded the fdic with initial loans of  million through the us treasury and the federal reserve which were later paid back with interest extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time separated commercial and investment banking glass–steagall act prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts allowed national banks to branch statewide if allowed by state law historical insurance limitsedit  –   –   –   –   –   –   –   –  congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from  to  which was effective from october   through december   on may   the temporary increase was extended through december   however the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act pl which was signed into law on july   made the  insurance limit permanent in addition the federal deposit insurance reform act of  pl allows for the boards of the fdic and the national credit union administration ncua to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in  and if warranted to adjust the amounts under a specified formula sl and bank crisis of the sedit main article savings and loan crisis federal deposit insurance received its first largescale test since the great depression in the late s and early s during the savings and loan crisis which also affected commercial banks and savings banks the brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic created to insure savings and loan sl institutions sls also called thrifts because of a confluence of events much of the sl industry was insolvent and many large banks were in trouble as well the fslic became insolvent and was abolished in august  it was replaced by the resolution trust corporation rtc on december   the rtc was merged into the fdic and the fdic became responsible for resolving failed thrifts supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency the office of thrift supervision credit unions remained insured by the national credit union administration the primary legislative responses to the crisis were the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  firrea and federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  fdicia federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and statechartered thrifts by the fdic final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of fslic and rtc resolutions was an estimated  billion of this total amount us taxpayer losses amounted to approximately  billion  of the total costs no taxpayer money was used to resolve fdicinsured institutions – financial crisisedit further information – global financial crisis edit in  twentyfive us banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority however during that year the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on september   when washington mutual with  billion in assets experienced a day bank run on its deposits the fdic created the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks thrifts and certain holding companies and by providing full coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts regardless of dollar amount the deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from  to  edit on august   bloomberg reported that more than  publicly traded us lenders had nonperforming loans above  of their total holdings this is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a banks equity and threaten its survival while this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt it is an important indicator for future fdic activity on august   guaranty bank in texas became insolvent and was taken over by bbva compass the us division of banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria the secondlargest bank in spain this was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of  and  in addition the fdic agreed to share losses with bbva on about  billion of guaranty banks loans and other assets this transaction alone cost the fdic deposit insurance fund  billion on august   the fdic increased the number of troubled banks to  in the second quarter that number compares to  just three months earlier at the end of the third quarter that number jumped to  at the close of  a total of  banks had become insolvent this is the largest number of bank failures in a year since  when  institutions failed edit on february   fdic chairman sheila bair warned that the number of failures in  could surpass the  banks that were seized in  commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in  on april   the fdic was appointed as receiver for three banks in puerto rico at a cost of  billion in   banks with approximately  billion in total assets failed in  a new division within the fdic the office of complex financial institutions was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the fdic by the doddfrank act for the assessment of risk in the largest systemically important financial institutions or sifis its current director is james wigand in june  wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director fundsedit former fundsedit between  and  there were two separate fdic funds – the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif the latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the s the existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks attempting to shift from one fund to another depending on the benefits each could provide in the s saif premiums were at one point five times higher than bif premiums several banks attempted to qualify for the bif with some merging with institutions qualified for the bif to avoid the higher premiums of the saif this drove up the bif premiums as well resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary then chairman of the federal reserve alan greenspan was a critic of the system saying we are in effect attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely governmentmandated deposit insurance such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference greenspan proposed to end this game and merge saif and bif deposit insurance fundedit in february  president george w bush signed into law the federal deposit insurance reform act of  fdira and a related conforming amendments act the fdira contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform as well as a number of study and survey requirements among the highlights of this law was merging the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif into a new fund the deposit insurance fund dif this change was made effective march   the fdic maintains the dif by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium the amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund bank failures typically represent a cost to the dif because the fdic as receiver of the failed institution must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while at the same time making good on the institutions deposit obligations bond interest payments of the financing corporation the funding vehicle for the resolution fund of the now defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic are funded by dif premiums a march  memorandum to the fdic board of directors shows a  yearend deposit insurance fund balance of about  billion which represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion the  yearend insured deposits were projected to reach about  trillion with the reserve growing to  billion a ratio of  as of june  the dif had a balance of  billion however  months later in march  the dif fell to  billion that was the lowest total since september  and represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion in the second quarter of  the fdic imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising  billion to replenish the dif however saxo bank research reported that after aug  further bank failures had reduced the dif balance to  million fdicestimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on aug  exceeded that amountcitation needed the fdic announced its intent on september   to assess the banks in advance for three years of premiums in an effort to avoid dif insolvency the fdic revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about  billion over the next four years an increase of  billion from the  billion estimate of earlier in  the fdic board voted to require insured banks to prepay  billion in premiums to replenish the fund news media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the fdic insurance fund the fdic elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years instead of drawing down banks statutory capital abruptly at the time of the assessment the fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to  percent of insured deposits as of june   the insured banks held approximately  billion in total deposits though not all of those are insured as of september   total deposits at fdicinsured institutions totaled roughly  trillion although not all deposits are insured the difs reserves are not the only cash resources available to the fdic in addition to  billion of cash and us treasury securities held as of march  the fdic has the ability to borrow up to  billion from the treasury the fdic can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of  full faith and creditedit in light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system the adequacy of fdics financial backing has come into question according to the fdicgov website as of march  fdic deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government this means that the resources of the united states government stand behind fdicinsured depositors the statutory basis for this assertion is unclear however congress in  passed a sense of congress to that effect but such enactments do not carry the force of law insurance requirementsedit to receive this benefit member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements banks are classified in five groups according to their riskbased capital ratio well capitalized  or higher adequately capitalized  or higher undercapitalized less than  significantly undercapitalized less than  critically undercapitalized less than  when a bank becomes undercapitalized the institutions primary regulator issues a warning to the bank when the number drops below  the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action when the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the fdic as receiver of the bank at q   banks had very low capital cushions against risk and were on the fdics problem list this was nearly  percent of all federally insured banks the highest level in  yearsneeds update resolution of insolvent banksedit a banks chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the us office of the comptroller of the currency—closes a bank and appoints the fdic as receiver in its role as a receiver the fdic is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution the fdic does not close banks the fdic as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the fdic acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer and the fdic as receiver has separate rights duties and obligations from those of the fdic as insurer courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities in  to comply with legislation the fdic amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds the procedures require the fdic to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution bids are submitted to the fdic where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made a receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution liquidate them and distribute the proceeds to the institutions creditors the fdic as receiver succeeds to the rights powers and privileges of the institution and its stockholders officers and directors the fdic may collect all obligations and money due to the institution preserve or liquidate its assets and property and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment a receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency court or party with contractual rights furthermore a receiver may form a new institution such as a bridge bank to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the fdic in its corporate capacity the two most common ways for the fdic to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are purchase and assumption agreement pa in which deposits liabilities are assumed by an open bank which also purchases some or all of the failed banks loans assets the banks assets that convey to the fdic as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods including online and using contractors deposit payoff as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift the fdic is appointed receiver the fdic as insurer pays all of the failed institutions depositors with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors such as suppliers and service providers of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement instead the fdic as receiver issues them receivership certificates a receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receivers collections on the failed institutions assets covered insured depository institutions resolution plansedit to assist the fdic in resolving an insolvent bank the fdic requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the dodd frank act in addition to the bank holding company bhc resolution plans required under the dodd frank act under section d the fdic requires a separate covered insured depository institution cidi resolution plan for us insured depositories with assets of  billion or more most of the largest most complex bhcs are subject to both rules requiring them to file a d resolution plan for the bhc that includes the bhcs core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries ie material entities as well as one or more cidi plans depending on the number of us bank subsidiaries of the bhc that meet the  billion asset threshold on december  the fdic issued guidance for the  resolution plans of cidis of large bank holding companies bhcs the guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the cidi resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the  cidi resolution plans including the assumption that the cidi must fail the cause of cidi failure must be a core business loss or impairment at least one multiple acquirer strategy is required in the plan a deep level of granularity is expected in the plan sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail a detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed key legal issues must be considered resolution obstacles must be addressed the cidi must be insolvent at the start of resolution insured productsedit example of fdic insurance coverage fdic deposit insurance covers deposit accounts which by the fdic definition include demand deposits checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts now accounts ie savings accounts that have checkwriting privileges savings accounts and money market deposit accounts mmdas ie higherinterest savings accounts subject to checkwriting restrictions time deposits including certificates of deposit cds outstanding cashiers checks interest checks and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank accounts denominated in foreign currencies accounts at different banks are insured separately all branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank also an internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank even if the name differs nonus citizens are also covered by fdic insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an fdicinsured bank the fdic publishes a guide entitled your insured deposits which sets forth the general characteristics of fdic deposit insurance and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance items not insurededit only the above types of accounts are insured some types of uninsured products even if purchased through a covered financial institution are stocks bonds and mutual funds including money funds the securities investor protection corporation a separate institution chartered by congress provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure but not against losses on the investments further as of september   the united states treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds which guarantees the value of the assets exceptions have occurred such as the fdic bailout of bondholders of continental illinois investments backed by the us government such as treasury securities the contents of safe deposit boxes even though the word deposit appears in the name under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an

depository institutions offer to customers maintaining a deposit account reloadable prepaid card or similar depositrelated vehicle the customer takes out a loan which is to be repaid from the proceeds of their next direct deposit deposit advance products share a number of characteristics seen in traditional payday loans including high fees short lumpsum repayment terms and inadequate attention to the consumers ability to repay as such banks need to be aware that deposit advance products can pose a variety of credit reputational operational compliance and other risks the fdic recognizes the demand for responsible smalldollar credit products for consumers that are underwritten with attention to the customers ability to repay the loan without needing to borrow repeatedly to meet necessary expenses the fdics  affordable smalldollar loan guidelines encourage insured institutions to offer smalldollar loan products that have affordable reasonable interest rates with no or low fees and payments that reduce the principal balance of the loan if structured properly smalldollar loans can provide a safe and affordable means for borrowers to transition away from reliance on highcost debt products a number of banks are currently offering such smalldollar loans to their customers the fdic encourages banks to continue to offer these products consistent with safety and soundness and other supervisory considerations the fdic also encourages banks to develop new or innovative programs to effectively meet the need for smalldollar credit attachment final guidance on supervisory concerns

bank than it is to keep it under the mattress” that same year the government established the federal deposit insurance corp or fdic as part of reform designed to improve public confidence in the us financial system and encourage people to put their money in banks that could lend it out and boost the economy this program insures deposits up to  per account holder in member banks in case the bank fails history of the fdic in  president franklin roosevelt signed the banking act of  in response to the banking crisis that occurred in the wake of the stock market’s crash in  afraid of losing all their savings bank customers withdrew their money from banks when these withdrawals happened in waves people drained their bank’s reserves and forced it to liquidate loans sell assets and close its doors each bank closure lowered the public’s confidence in the economy and the banking system the banking act of  established guidelines for banks that improved their stability as part of this reform the government established the fdic or federal deposit insurance corp however this provision was highly controversial as large banks believed it would force them to subsidize small rural banks it prevailed becoming effective the following year to insure deposits up to  this limit increased over time eventually reaching the  limit allowed today how the fdic works fdic member banks pay annual dues that fund the program when a bank cannot meet its financial obligations which happens when account holders remove enough money to lower the bank’s reserves too much or when the bank’s credit rating drops so low that other banks won’t lend it money the bank fails this is when the fdic steps in to make sure depositors don’t lose their money however like any insurance policy the fdic has restrictions on the types of accounts covered and which events qualify covered accounts the fdic protects deposits made by account holders and for this reason only certain types of accounts have this protection it insures  of the amount in the following accounts up to the  limit checking accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit money market accounts although some member banks offer additional services and investment products the fdic does not protect the money in these accounts the following accounts are not fdicinsured annuities bonds life insurance policies municipal securities mutual funds stocks us treasury bills bonds or notes the fdic also excludes items and documents stored in safe deposit boxes account holders need to check their homeowner’s insurance policies or with their banks to find out what private insurance coverage protects these items however it does honor cashier’s checks and money orders issued by a failed bank covered events the fdic pays out a benefit only when a bank fails and closes its doors sometimes struggling banks sell their assets and accounts to larger banks as a way to avoid closing when this happens account holders still have access to their money they just receive debit cards and bank statements with different logos the fdic also does not cover fraud and identity theft when account holders lose money because of fraud or identity theft the bank shoulders the responsibility for the problem coverage limits perhaps the most confusing aspect of the fdic is the coverage limit individuals who have less than  receive the full amount they have in the account if the bank fails those who have more than  in accounts need to pay attention to the types of accounts and their ownership categories to maximize their protection for example take a couple with  in savings if they keep all this money in a single account and the bank holding this account fails they receive  of the money and lose the rest to avoid this problem they can deposit the money in accounts at different banks or that fall under different ownership categories other banking terms bill presentment you need to understand what bill presentment is

initial capital contributions the fdic paid about  million to the treasury the legislation also removed the fdic from the federal reserve act’s jurisdiction and placed it under a separate body of law called the federal deposit insurance act although this has proved to be largely a symbolic act it does stress the separate nature of the fdic   in  net assessments on banks were reduced again the rebate percentage increased to  giving the fdic a larger share of the risk in the event of a bank’s failure   the first  million loss for the fdic was in  when the  million birmingham bloomfield bank

had dropped its plans of opening a specialty bank walmart raised considerable controversy when it announced its plans in  the retail giant said it was interested in providing financial services to its customers but withdrew its application when it realized the process would take years not months a stumbling block for the giant retailer was federal legislation that imposed strict limitations on ownership of industrial loan companies ilcs and prohibited commercial firms deriving more than  of their gross revenues from activities that are not financial in nature these moves were intended to prevent new banking enterprises from straining the fdic’s safety net the fdic put a moratorium on approving any new ilc applications until january   home depot another retail store also had plans to

fdic says cnbc   nader charges many banks enjoying free fdic coverage in a march   post on his web site consumer advocate ralph nader charged that giveaways by the clinton administration had led to many commercial banks enjoying free federal deposit insurance since  fdic’s decision to let banks drop premiums when the insurance fund’s reserve reached the minimum of  of insured deposits has come back to haunt the agency nader charged because as banks continue to fail the reserves are not replenished equally this failure to pay premiums has resulted in a surplus of – billion annually and

financial institutions savings checking individual retirement accounts iras and other deposit accounts when combined are insured up to  per depositor   the fdic does not insure securities mutual funds or similar investments such as stocks money market accounts and bonds it does not cover investments backed by the us government such as us treasury securities contents of safe deposit boxes accounting errors or losses due to theft or fraud at an institution lastly the fdic does not provide insurance coverage to insurance and annuity products such as life auto and homeowner’s insurance   the fdic identifies and monitors risks to its own deposit insurance funds these funds are accumulated through premiums paid by banks that receive the fdic’s deposit insurance and from interest earned on us treasury securities   the fdic oversees approximately  banks and savings banks this is more than half of the financial institutions in the american banking system although the fdic is the primary federal regulator of the banks chartered by states it is also a backup supervisor for remaining insured banks and thrift institutions   when a bank fails the fdic has several options to help solve a failed bank’s financial problems but the most popular remedy is to sell deposits and loans of the failed institutions to another institution customers of the old institution become customers of the new institution and can access their money in this way   the fdic has several components that help to achieve its goals the fdic advisory committee on economic inclusion comein was established by chairman sheila c bair and the fdic board of directors pursuant to the federal advisory committee act and chartered in november  the committee was formed to provide the fdic with advice and recommendations on banking policies and initiatives especially as they relate to underserved populations this may include reviewing basic retail financial services such as check cashing money orders remittances stored value cards shortterm loans savings accounts and other services that promote saving and investing   the fdic also has an office of international affairs that helps the agency

the banking business in march  the fdic revealed that superstore walmart had dropped its plans of opening a specialty bank walmart raised considerable controversy when it announced its plans in  the retail giant said it was interested in providing financial services to its customers but withdrew its application when it realized the process would take years not months a stumbling block for the giant retailer was federal legislation that imposed strict limitations on ownership of industrial loan companies ilcs and prohibited commercial firms deriving more than  of their gross revenues from activities that are not financial in nature these moves were intended to prevent new banking enterprises from straining the fdic’s safety net the fdic put a moratorium on approving any new ilc applications until january   home depot another retail store also had plans to launch its own ilc and was undeterred by walmart’s decision other companies that have tried to launch similar plans or have been scuttled in the past include general motors bluecross blueshield and a california credit union fed resists retailers ownership of banks by damian paletta dow jones house adopts measure to

advocate ralph nader charged that giveaways by the clinton administration had led to many commercial banks enjoying free federal deposit insurance since  fdic’s decision to let banks drop premiums when the insurance fund’s reserve reached the minimum of  of insured deposits has come back to haunt the agency nader charged because as banks continue to fail the reserves are not replenished equally this failure to pay premiums has resulted in a surplus of – billion annually and although lobbyists had suggested that the savings would be passed along to consumers bank fees have continued to rise each year fdic insurance scam ralph nader naderorg more less suggested reforms eliminate or expand the fdic   having insured bank deposits since the depression the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic has outlived its usefulness according to some banking experts others though not only want it to stick around but expand its mission   peter atwater who helped build jp morgan’s securitization business during the late s and early s wants to eliminate the fdic atwater thinks doing so will promote bank stability by removing the industry’s security blanket and encouraging it to be more responsible as long as the fdic is around “depositor due diligence is nonexistent”   meanwhile amar bhide the thomas schmidheiny professor at the fletcher school of law and diplomacy wants the government to remove the  limit on fdic insurance so that banks can insure deposits made by corporations and wealthy investors peter atwater suggests eliminating fdic as part of banking reform by sam

home insurance articles homeowners insurance rate discounts home insurance covers damage and replacement costs to property structures and possessions depending on the amount of property insured the cost of insuring a house and possessions can become expensive if an individual is insuring a house that is in a “high risk” area such as an earthquake zone or flood plain the costs of insuring the home can be even more expensive guidelines for saving money on rates there are steps homeowners can take to help reduce costs of homeowners insurance rates not all of these will be applicable in all states home insurance discounts and lower prices can usually be obtained by following a few general guidelines compare prices – different insurance companies charge different rates collecting a few quotes from different companies gives a homeowner the ability to choose the plan that best suits their financial needs also by visiting with agents or calling different companies homeowners can get a feel for how the company may interact with them should there be a claim raise the deductible – a higher deductible means lower premiums to pay keep in mind that should disaster hit an individual should be able to pay the higher deductible if he or she wants to fully repair or restore property damage also depending on the location of the home the homeowner may be required to own separate insurance for different types of disasters these separate policies each have their own deductible which can also be raised to provide lower premiums purchase multiple insurance policies from the same company – most companies will provide discounts on home insurance policies if the homeowner also purchases their auto insurance from the same company usually the more policies purchased from the company the more each individual policy is discounted build in protection – making small and large improvements to a home in order to make it stronger and less vulnerable to common disasters can lower the home insurance rate reinforcing roofs in windstormprone areas or retrofitting an older home in an earthquake zone are two examples insure the house not the land – the purchase price of a house includes the land value as well since land cannot be stolen and is generally less prone to damage than a house its value doesn’t need to be included with insurance rebuilding costs insure the house not the land security systems – fire alarms and monitored security systems often provide homeowners a discount through the insurance company some locking systems and sprinkler systems for fire also qualify since not all security systems and measures qualify for discounts and others are expensive a homeowner should check with the insurance company to see what systems qualify for a discount before purchasing or installing the system ask – ask the insurance company what kinds of discounts they offer different companies offer different discounts and incentives group insurance coverage – some homeowners insurance rate discounts is available through groups such as alumni organizations or professional associations longterm discounts – some insurance companies offer discounts to homeowners who stay with them for long periods homeowners should still periodically compare their insurance price with that of other companies review policies annually – if improvements have been made or expensive furnishings acquired then the amount of coverage on a home insurance policy needs to reflect these changes furthermore if certain possessions have lost value or are no longer around then

jennings bryan presented a bill to congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund no action was taken as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time after  eight states established deposit insurance funds due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch small local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers especially in the western and southern states in  there were about  banks in the us the federal reserve act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance but it was removed from the bill by the house of representatives from  to the fdics creation in   bills were submitted in congress proposing deposit insurance the great depression devastated the american banking system

affected reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors fears many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearlyinsolvent banks establishment of the fdic edit president franklin d roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits saying we do not wish to make the united states government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks and put a premium on unsound banking in the future but public support was overwhelmingly in favor and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero on  june  roosevelt signed the  banking act into law creating the fdic the initial plan set by congress in  was to insure deposits up to   today adopting of a more generous longterm plan after six monthsnote  however the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to   today president franklin delano roosevelt signs the banking act of  the  banking act established the fdic as a temporary government corporation the banking act of

administration ncua to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in  and if warranted to adjust the amounts under a specified formula sl and bank crisis of the sedit main article savings and loan crisis federal deposit insurance received its first largescale test since the great depression in the late s and early s during the savings and loan crisis which also affected commercial banks and savings banks the brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic created to insure savings and loan sl institutions sls also called thrifts because of a confluence of events much of the sl industry was insolvent and many large banks were in trouble as well the fslic became insolvent and was abolished in august  it was replaced by the resolution trust corporation rtc on december   the rtc was merged into the fdic and the fdic became responsible for resolving failed thrifts supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency the office of thrift supervision credit unions remained insured by the national credit union administration the primary legislative responses to the crisis were the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  firrea and federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  fdicia federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and statechartered thrifts by the fdic final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of fslic and rtc resolutions was an estimated  billion of this total amount us taxpayer losses amounted to approximately  billion  of the total costs no taxpayer money was used to resolve fdicinsured institutions – financial crisisedit further information – global financial crisis edit in  twentyfive us banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority however during that year the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on september   when washington mutual with  billion in assets experienced a day bank run on its deposits the fdic created the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks thrifts and certain holding companies and by providing full coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts regardless of dollar amount the deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from  to  edit on august   bloomberg reported that more than  publicly traded us lenders had nonperforming loans above  of their total holdings this is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a banks equity and threaten its survival while this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt it is an important indicator for future fdic activity on august   guaranty bank in texas became insolvent and was taken over by bbva compass the us division of banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria the secondlargest bank in spain this was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of  and  in addition the fdic agreed to share losses with bbva on about  billion of guaranty banks loans and other assets this transaction alone cost the fdic deposit insurance fund  billion on august   the fdic increased the number of troubled banks to  in the second quarter that number compares to  just three months earlier at the end of the third quarter that number jumped to  at the close of  a total of  banks had become insolvent this is the largest number of bank failures in a year since  when  institutions failed edit on february   fdic chairman sheila bair warned that the number of failures in  could surpass the  banks that were seized in  commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in  on april   the fdic was appointed as receiver for three banks in puerto rico at a cost of  billion in   banks with approximately  billion in total assets failed in  a new division within the fdic the office of complex financial institutions was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the fdic by the doddfrank act for the assessment of risk in the largest systemically important financial institutions or sifis its current director is james wigand in june  wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director fundsedit former fundsedit between  and  there were two separate fdic funds – the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif the latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the s the existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks attempting to shift from one fund to another depending on the benefits each could provide in the s saif premiums were at one point five times higher than bif premiums several banks attempted to qualify for the bif with some merging with institutions qualified for the bif to avoid the higher premiums of the saif this drove up the bif premiums as well resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary then chairman of the federal reserve alan greenspan was a critic of the system saying we are in effect attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely governmentmandated deposit insurance such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference greenspan proposed to end this game and merge saif and bif deposit insurance fundedit in february  president george w bush signed into law the federal deposit insurance reform act of  fdira and a related conforming amendments act the fdira contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform as well as a number of study and survey requirements among the highlights of this law was merging the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif into a new fund the deposit insurance fund dif this change was made effective march   the fdic maintains the dif by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium the amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund bank failures typically represent a cost to the dif because the fdic as receiver of the failed institution must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while at the same time making good on the institutions deposit obligations bond interest payments of the financing corporation the funding vehicle for the resolution fund of the now defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic are funded by dif premiums a march  memorandum to the fdic board of directors shows a  yearend deposit insurance fund balance of about  billion which represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion the  yearend insured deposits were projected to reach about  trillion with the reserve growing to  billion a ratio of  as of june  the dif had a balance of  billion however  months later in march  the dif fell to  billion that was the lowest total since september  and represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion in the second quarter of  the fdic imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising  billion to replenish the dif however saxo bank research reported that after aug  further bank failures had reduced the dif balance to  million fdicestimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on aug  exceeded that amountcitation needed the fdic announced its intent on september   to assess the banks in advance for three years of premiums in an effort to avoid dif insolvency the fdic revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about  billion over the next four years an increase of  billion from the  billion estimate of earlier in  the fdic board voted to require insured banks to prepay  billion in premiums to replenish the fund news media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the fdic insurance fund the fdic elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years instead of drawing down banks statutory capital abruptly at the time of the assessment the fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to  percent of insured deposits as of june   the insured banks held approximately  billion in total deposits though not all of those are insured as of september   total deposits at fdicinsured institutions totaled roughly  trillion although not all deposits are insured the difs reserves are not the only cash resources available to the fdic in addition to  billion of cash and us treasury securities held as of march  the fdic has the ability to borrow up to  billion from the treasury the fdic can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of  full faith and creditedit in light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system the adequacy of fdics financial backing has come into question according to the fdicgov website as of march  fdic deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government this means that the resources of the united states government stand behind fdicinsured depositors the statutory basis for this assertion is unclear however congress in  passed a sense of congress to that effect but such enactments do not carry the force of law insurance requirementsedit to receive this benefit member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements banks are classified in five groups according to their riskbased capital ratio well capitalized  or higher adequately capitalized  or higher undercapitalized less than  significantly undercapitalized less than  critically undercapitalized less than  when a bank becomes undercapitalized the institutions primary regulator issues a warning to the bank when the number drops below  the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action when the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the fdic as receiver of the bank at q   banks had very low capital cushions against risk and were on the fdics problem list this was nearly  percent of all federally insured banks the highest level in  yearsneeds update resolution of insolvent banksedit a banks chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the us office of the comptroller of the currency—closes a bank and appoints the fdic as receiver in its role as a receiver the fdic is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution the fdic does not close banks the fdic as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the fdic acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer and the fdic as receiver has separate rights duties and obligations from those of the fdic as insurer courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities in  to comply with legislation the fdic amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds the procedures require the fdic to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution bids are submitted to the fdic where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made a receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution liquidate them and distribute the proceeds to the institutions creditors the fdic as receiver succeeds to the rights powers and privileges of the institution and its stockholders officers and directors the fdic may collect all obligations and money due to the institution preserve or liquidate its assets and property and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment a receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency court or party with contractual rights furthermore a receiver may form a new institution such as a bridge bank to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the fdic in its corporate capacity the two most common ways for the fdic to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are purchase and assumption agreement pa in which deposits liabilities are assumed by an open bank which also purchases some or all of the failed banks loans assets the banks assets that convey to the fdic as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods including online and using contractors deposit payoff as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift the fdic is appointed receiver the fdic as insurer pays all of the failed institutions depositors with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors such as suppliers and service providers of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement instead the fdic as receiver issues them receivership certificates a receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receivers collections on the failed institutions assets covered insured depository institutions resolution plansedit to assist the fdic in resolving an insolvent bank the fdic requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the dodd frank act in addition to the bank holding company bhc resolution plans required under the dodd frank act under section d the fdic requires a separate covered insured depository institution cidi resolution plan for us insured depositories with assets of  billion or more most of the largest most complex bhcs are subject to both rules requiring them to file a

panic of  and great depression during the panics of  and  many banksnote  filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance in  william jennings bryan presented a bill to congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund no action was taken as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time after  eight states established deposit insurance funds due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch small local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers especially in the western and southern states in  there were about  banks in the us the federal reserve act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance but it was removed from the bill by the house of representatives from  to the fdics creation in   bills were submitted in congress proposing deposit insurance the great depression devastated the american banking system there was widespread panic over the american banking system in the years before the fdics creation more than onethird of all banks failed due to bank runs small banks in rural areas were especially affected reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors fears many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearlyinsolvent banks establishment of the fdic edit president franklin d roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits saying we do not wish to make the united states government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks and put a premium on unsound banking in the future but public support was overwhelmingly in favor and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero on  june  roosevelt signed the  banking act into law creating the fdic the initial plan set by congress in  was to insure deposits up to   today adopting of a more generous longterm plan after six monthsnote  however the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to   today president franklin delano roosevelt signs the banking act of  the  banking act established the fdic as a temporary government corporation the banking act of  made the fdic a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the  level gave the fdic authority to provide deposit insurance to banks gave the fdic the authority to regulate and supervise state nonmember banks funded the fdic with initial loans of  million through the us treasury and the federal reserve which were later paid back with interest extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time separated commercial and investment banking glass–steagall act prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts allowed national banks to branch statewide if allowed by state law historical insurance limitsedit  –   –   –   –   –   –   –   –  congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from  to  which was effective from october   through december   on may   the temporary increase was extended through december   however the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act pl which was signed into law on july   made the  insurance limit permanent in addition the federal deposit insurance reform act of  pl allows for the boards of the fdic and the national credit union administration ncua to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in  and if warranted to adjust the amounts under a specified formula sl and bank crisis of the sedit main article savings and loan crisis federal deposit insurance received its first largescale test since the great depression in the late s and early s during the savings and loan crisis which also affected commercial banks and savings banks the brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic created to insure savings and loan sl institutions sls also called thrifts because of a confluence of events much of the sl industry was insolvent and many large banks were in trouble as well the fslic became insolvent and was abolished in august  it was replaced by the resolution trust corporation rtc on december   the rtc was merged into the fdic and the fdic became responsible for resolving failed thrifts supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency the office of thrift supervision credit unions remained insured by the national credit union administration the primary legislative responses to the crisis were the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  firrea and federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  fdicia federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and statechartered thrifts by the fdic final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of fslic and rtc resolutions was an estimated  billion of this total amount us taxpayer losses amounted to approximately  billion  of the total costs no taxpayer money was used to resolve fdicinsured institutions – financial crisisedit further information – global financial crisis edit in  twentyfive us banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority however during that year the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on september   when washington mutual with  billion in assets experienced a day bank run on its deposits the fdic created the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks thrifts and certain holding companies and by providing full coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts regardless of dollar amount the deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from  to  edit on august   bloomberg reported that more than  publicly traded us lenders had nonperforming loans above  of their total holdings this is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a banks equity and threaten its survival while this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt it is an important indicator for future fdic activity on august   guaranty bank in texas became insolvent and was taken over by bbva compass the us division of banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria the secondlargest bank in spain this was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of  and  in addition the fdic agreed to share losses with bbva on about  billion of guaranty banks loans and other assets this transaction alone cost the fdic deposit insurance fund  billion on august   the fdic increased the number of troubled banks to  in the second quarter that number compares to  just three months earlier at the end of the third quarter that number jumped to  at the close of  a total of  banks had become insolvent this is the largest number of bank failures in a year since  when  institutions failed edit on february   fdic chairman sheila bair warned that the number of failures in  could surpass the  banks that were seized in  commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in  on april   the fdic was appointed as receiver for three banks in puerto rico at a cost of  billion in   banks with approximately  billion in total assets failed in  a new division within the fdic the office of complex financial institutions was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the fdic by the doddfrank act for the assessment of risk in the largest systemically important financial institutions or sifis its current director is james wigand in june  wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director fundsedit former fundsedit between  and  there were two separate fdic funds – the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif the latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the s the existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks attempting to shift from one fund to another depending on the benefits each could provide in the s saif premiums were at one point five times higher than bif premiums several banks attempted to qualify for the bif with some merging with institutions qualified for the bif to avoid the higher premiums of the saif this drove up the bif premiums as well resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary then chairman of the federal reserve alan greenspan was a critic of the system saying we are in effect attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely governmentmandated deposit insurance such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference greenspan proposed to end this game and merge saif and bif deposit insurance fundedit in february  president george w bush signed into law the federal deposit insurance reform act of  fdira and a related conforming amendments act the fdira contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform as well as a number of study and survey requirements among the highlights of this law was merging the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif into a new fund the deposit insurance fund dif this change was made effective march   the fdic maintains the dif by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium the amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund bank failures typically represent a cost to the dif because the fdic as receiver of the failed institution must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while at the same time making good on the institutions deposit obligations bond interest payments of the financing corporation the funding vehicle for the resolution fund of the now defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic are funded by dif premiums a march  memorandum to the fdic board of directors shows a  yearend deposit insurance fund balance of about  billion which represented a reserve ratio of  of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about  trillion the  yearend insured deposits were projected to reach about  trillion with the reserve growing to  billion a ratio of  as of june  the dif had a balance of  billion however  months later in march  the dif fell to  billion that was the lowest total since september  and

list this was nearly  percent of all federally insured banks the highest level in  yearsneeds update resolution of insolvent banksedit a banks chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the us office of the comptroller of the currency—closes a bank and appoints the fdic as receiver in its role as a receiver the fdic is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution the fdic does not close banks the fdic as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the fdic acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer and the fdic as receiver has separate rights duties and obligations from those of the fdic as insurer courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities in  to comply with legislation the fdic amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds the procedures require the fdic to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution bids are submitted to the fdic where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made a receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution liquidate them and distribute the proceeds to the institutions creditors the fdic as receiver succeeds to the rights powers and privileges of the institution and its stockholders officers and directors the fdic may collect all obligations and money due to the institution preserve or liquidate its assets and property and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment a receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency court or party with contractual rights furthermore a receiver may form a new institution such as a bridge bank to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the fdic in its corporate capacity the two most common ways for the fdic to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are purchase and assumption agreement pa in which deposits liabilities are assumed by an open bank which also purchases some or all of the failed banks loans assets the banks assets that convey to the fdic as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods including online and using contractors deposit payoff as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift the fdic is appointed receiver the fdic as insurer pays all of the failed institutions depositors with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors such as suppliers and service providers of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement instead the fdic as receiver issues them receivership certificates a receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receivers collections on the failed institutions assets covered insured depository institutions resolution plansedit to assist the fdic in resolving an insolvent bank the fdic requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the dodd frank act in addition to the bank holding company bhc resolution plans required under the dodd frank act under section d the fdic requires a separate covered insured depository institution cidi resolution plan for us insured depositories with assets of  billion or more most of the largest most complex bhcs are subject to both rules requiring them to file a d resolution plan for the bhc that includes the bhcs core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries ie material entities as well as one or more cidi plans depending on the number of us bank subsidiaries of the bhc that meet the  billion asset threshold on december  the fdic issued guidance for the  resolution plans of cidis of large bank holding companies bhcs the guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the cidi resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the  cidi resolution plans including the assumption that the cidi must fail the cause of cidi failure must be a core business loss or impairment at least one multiple acquirer strategy is required in the plan a deep level of granularity is expected in the plan sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail a detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed key legal issues must be considered resolution obstacles must be addressed the cidi must be insolvent at the start of resolution insured productsedit example of fdic insurance coverage fdic deposit insurance covers deposit accounts which by the fdic definition include demand deposits checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts now accounts ie savings accounts that have checkwriting privileges savings accounts and money market deposit accounts mmdas ie higherinterest savings accounts subject to checkwriting restrictions time deposits including certificates of deposit cds outstanding cashiers checks interest checks and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank accounts denominated in foreign currencies accounts at different banks are insured separately all branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank also an internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank even if the name differs nonus citizens are also covered by fdic insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an fdicinsured bank the fdic publishes a guide entitled your insured deposits which sets forth the general characteristics of fdic deposit insurance and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance items not insurededit only the above types of accounts are insured some types of uninsured products even if purchased through a covered financial institution are stocks bonds and mutual funds including money funds the securities investor protection corporation a separate institution chartered by congress provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure but not against losses on the investments further as of september   the united states treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds which guarantees the value of the assets exceptions have occurred such as the fdic bailout of bondholders of continental illinois investments backed by the us government such as treasury securities the contents of safe deposit boxes even though the word deposit appears in the name under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer losses due to theft or fraud at the institution these situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking institutions buy from private insurance companies accounting errors in these situations there may be remedies for consumers under state contract law the uniform

revocable trust accounts containing the words payable on death in trust for etc irrevocable trust accounts employee benefit plan accounts deposits of a pension plan corporationpartnershipunincorporated association accounts government accounts all amounts that a particular depositor has in accounts in any particular ownership category at a particular bank are added together and are insured up to  for joint accounts each coowner is assumed unless the account specifically states otherwise to own the same fraction of the account as does each other coowner even though each coowner may be eligible to withdraw all funds from the account thus if three people jointly own a  account the entire account balance is insured because each depositors  share of the account is insured the owner of a revocable trust account is generally insured up to  for each unique beneficiary subject to special rules if there are more than five of them thus if there is a single

runs caused by contagion both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance in  william jennings bryan presented a bill to congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund no action was taken as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time after  eight states established deposit insurance funds due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch small local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers especially in the western and southern states in  there were about  banks in the us the federal reserve act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance but it was removed from the bill by the house of representatives from  to the fdics creation in   bills were submitted in congress proposing deposit insurance the great depression devastated the american banking system there was widespread panic over the american banking system in the years before the fdics creation more than onethird of all banks failed due to bank runs small banks in rural areas were especially affected reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors fears many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearlyinsolvent banks establishment of the fdic edit president franklin d roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits saying we do not wish to make the united states government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks and put a premium on unsound banking in the future but public support was overwhelmingly in favor and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero on  june  roosevelt signed the  banking act into law creating the fdic the initial plan set by congress in  was to insure deposits up to   today adopting of a more generous longterm plan after six monthsnote  however the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to   today president franklin delano roosevelt signs the banking act of  the  banking act established the fdic as a temporary government corporation the banking act of  made the fdic a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the  level gave the fdic authority to provide deposit insurance to banks gave the fdic the authority to regulate and supervise state nonmember banks funded the fdic with initial loans of  million through

reform act of  pl allows for the boards of the fdic and the national credit union administration ncua to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in  and if warranted to adjust the amounts under a specified formula sl and bank crisis of the sedit main article savings and loan crisis federal deposit insurance received its first largescale test since the great depression in the late s and early s during the savings and loan crisis which also affected commercial banks and savings banks the brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic created to insure savings and loan sl institutions sls also called thrifts because of a confluence of events much of the sl industry was insolvent and many large banks were in trouble as well the fslic became insolvent and was abolished in august  it was replaced by the resolution trust corporation rtc on december   the rtc was merged into the fdic and the fdic became responsible for resolving failed thrifts supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency the office of thrift supervision credit unions remained insured by the national credit union administration the primary legislative responses to the crisis were the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  firrea and federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  fdicia federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and statechartered thrifts by the fdic final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of fslic and rtc resolutions was an estimated  billion of this total amount us taxpayer losses amounted to approximately  billion  of the total costs no taxpayer money was used to resolve fdicinsured institutions – financial crisisedit further information – global financial crisis edit in  twentyfive us banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority however during that year the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on september   when washington mutual with  billion in assets experienced a day bank run on its deposits the fdic created the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks thrifts and certain holding companies and by providing full coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts regardless of dollar amount the deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from  to  edit on august   bloomberg reported that more than  publicly traded us lenders had nonperforming loans above  of their total holdings this is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a banks equity and threaten its survival while this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt it is an important indicator for future fdic activity on august   guaranty bank in texas became insolvent and was taken over by bbva compass the us division of banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria the secondlargest bank in spain this was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of  and  in addition the fdic agreed to share losses with bbva on about  billion of guaranty banks loans and other assets this transaction alone cost the fdic deposit insurance fund  billion on august   the fdic increased the number of troubled banks to  in the second quarter that number compares to  just three months earlier at the end of the third quarter that number jumped to  at the close of  a total of  banks had become insolvent this is the largest number of bank failures in a year since  when  institutions failed edit on february   fdic chairman sheila bair warned that the number of failures in  could surpass the  banks that were seized in  commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in  on april   the fdic was appointed as receiver for three banks in puerto rico at a cost of  billion in   banks with approximately  billion in total assets failed in  a new division within the fdic the office of complex financial institutions was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the fdic by the doddfrank act for the assessment of risk in the largest systemically important financial institutions or sifis its current director is james wigand in june  wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director fundsedit former fundsedit between  and  there were two separate fdic funds – the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif the latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the s the existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks attempting to shift from one fund to another depending on the benefits each could provide in the s saif premiums were at one point five times higher than bif premiums several banks attempted to qualify for the bif with some merging with institutions qualified for the bif to avoid the higher premiums of the saif this drove up the bif premiums as well resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary then chairman of the federal reserve alan greenspan was a critic of the system saying we are in effect attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely governmentmandated deposit insurance such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference greenspan proposed to end this game and merge saif and bif deposit insurance fundedit in february  president george w bush signed into law the federal deposit insurance reform act of  fdira and a related conforming amendments act the fdira contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform as well as a number of study and survey requirements among the highlights of this law was merging the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif into a new fund the deposit insurance fund dif this change was made effective march   the fdic maintains the dif by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium the amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund bank failures typically represent a cost to the dif because the fdic as receiver of the failed institution must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while at the same time making good on the institutions deposit obligations bond interest payments of the financing corporation the funding vehicle for the resolution fund of the now defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic

resolution of insolvent banksedit a banks chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the us office of the comptroller of the currency—closes a bank and appoints the fdic as receiver in its role as a receiver the fdic is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution the fdic does not close banks the fdic as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the fdic acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer and the fdic as receiver has separate rights duties and obligations from those of the fdic as insurer courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities in  to comply with legislation the fdic amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds the procedures require the fdic to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution bids are submitted to the fdic where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made a receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution liquidate them and distribute the proceeds to the institutions creditors the fdic as receiver succeeds to the rights powers and privileges of the institution and its stockholders officers and directors the fdic may collect all obligations and money due to the institution preserve or liquidate its assets and property and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment a receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency court or party with contractual rights furthermore a receiver may form a new institution such as a bridge bank to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the fdic in its corporate capacity the two most common ways for the fdic to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are purchase and assumption agreement pa in which deposits liabilities are assumed by an open bank which also purchases some or all of the failed banks loans assets the banks assets that convey to the fdic as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods including online and using contractors deposit payoff as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift the fdic is appointed receiver the fdic as insurer pays all of the failed institutions depositors with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors such as suppliers and service providers of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement instead the fdic as receiver issues them receivership certificates a receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receivers collections on the failed institutions assets covered insured depository institutions resolution plansedit to assist the fdic in resolving an insolvent bank the fdic requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the dodd frank act in addition to the bank holding company bhc resolution plans required under the dodd frank act under section d the fdic requires a separate covered insured depository institution cidi resolution plan for us insured depositories with assets of  billion or more most of the largest most complex bhcs are subject to both rules requiring them to file a d resolution plan for the bhc that includes the bhcs core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries ie material entities as well as one or more cidi plans depending on the number of us bank subsidiaries of the bhc that meet the  billion asset threshold on december  the fdic issued guidance for the  resolution plans of cidis of large bank holding companies bhcs the guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the cidi resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the  cidi resolution plans including the assumption that the cidi must fail the cause of cidi failure must be a core business loss or impairment at least one multiple acquirer strategy is required in the plan a deep level of granularity is expected in the plan sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail a detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed key legal issues must be considered resolution obstacles must be addressed the cidi must be insolvent at the start of resolution insured productsedit example of fdic insurance coverage fdic deposit insurance covers deposit accounts which by the fdic definition include demand deposits checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts now accounts ie savings accounts that have checkwriting privileges savings accounts and money market deposit accounts mmdas ie higherinterest savings accounts subject to checkwriting restrictions time deposits including certificates of deposit cds outstanding cashiers checks interest checks and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank accounts denominated in foreign currencies accounts at different banks are insured separately all branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank also an internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank even if the name differs nonus citizens are also covered by fdic insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an fdicinsured bank the fdic publishes a guide entitled your insured deposits which sets forth the general characteristics of fdic deposit insurance and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance items not insurededit only the above types of accounts are insured some types of uninsured products even if purchased through a covered financial institution are stocks bonds and mutual funds including money funds the securities investor protection corporation a separate institution chartered by congress provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure but not against losses on the investments further as of september   the united states treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds which guarantees the value of the assets exceptions have occurred such as the fdic bailout of bondholders of continental illinois investments backed by the us government such as treasury securities the contents of safe deposit boxes even though the word deposit appears in the name under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer losses due to theft or fraud at the institution these situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking institutions buy from private insurance
