copyright  thomson gale leroy c richie – attorney company executive at a glance… sources until  leroy c richie was one of the highestranking african americans among the management ranks of the domestic automobile manufacturing industry as general counsel and vice president of automotive legal affairs for the chrysler corporation the attorney and former new yorker was part of a corporate team that shepherded the automaker into a new solidly profitable era in the late s and early s his highprofile position helped pave the way for other minority executives among the “big three” chrysler general motors and ford when richie arrived in detroit in  there were few african americans at the top executive level among the carmakers but when he retired fifteen years later that number had increased significantly richie was born and raised in buffalo new york the son of a train porter from an early age he felt he might have a talent for legal advocacy—he was an excellent student in high school wellliked by teachers and students alike and when his friends were called into the viceprincipal’s office for disciplinary action richie often managed to intercede on their behalf his talents as a persuasive arguer led him first to pursue a degree in philosophy at the city college of new york where he graduated first in his class and then on to the prestigious new york university school of law after interning at the new york city branch of the american civil liberties union richie earned his jd in  corporate law not constitutional challenges however was richie’s area of interest and after passing the bar he landed a job with the new york city firm of white  case he chose this field as he recalled in an interview with ebony magazine “because of the high activity and the intellectual challenge it offers” richie was with white  case for five years litigating on behalf of the firm’s array of corporate clients on real estate tax and insurance matters in  he was tapped to head the us federal trade commission’s new york city regional trade office it was the commission’s largest such office in the nation and as its director richie was responsible for its antitrust litigation overseeing settlement negotiations and numerous other complex legal matters his track record there attracted the attention of both chrysler corporation chair lee iacocca and richard goodyear then general counsel for the michigan automobile manufacturer they wooed richie away from the federal trade commission job to become chrysler’s assistant general counsel for labor personnel and management in  it was also necessary to convince richie and his wife julia that relocating to the detroit area would be a rewarding experience the couple had spent much of their adult lives in the new york city area were raising a family that would eventually number five and were leery of uprooting in an interview with the detroit free press several years later richie admitted that he and julia initially assumed they would both miss new york city’s “very special energy” as richie told the paper yet at a glance… born september   in buffalo ny son of leroy c a pullman porter and mattie aallen

university  addresses  home —birmingham ml office—co highland park development corporation  second ave highland park ml  richie was happy to discover that “chrysler emulates that energy especially at the top levels” the richies were also pleased to find a much different mindset in their new environs—the auto executive described midwesterners as “much warmer … when you’re  and come to a new place it’s not easy to establish new meaningful relationships” he told the free press in  in  richie became associate general counsel for chrysler and two years later was named general counsel and vice president of automotive legal affairs making him the only african american among the executive ranks of the big three automakers at the time it was no cushy job and thirteenhour days at chrysler headquarters were not uncommon for him “the most challenging part of this job is developing creative solutions to the legal problems that the company faces while remaining consistent with our “can do’ motto richie told ebony magazine not long after taking the job in  during this era chrysler was emerging out of one of its darkest financial periods and one of the most significant changes richie was able to implement concerned the way the company farmed out its legal work standard procedure for automakers and other large corporations was to hire law firms when they needed them and pay them hourly which in productliability lawsuits might run into millions of dollars richie instituted a flatfee system for litigation with one firm in each region of the united states handling the company’s litigation needs such firms had usually done work for chrysler before and bid for threeyear contracts to represent the automaker the new system would greatly reduce the automaker’s costs for productliability suits during his tenure at chrysler richie was a lowkey member of the executive roster until a controversy involving a prominent private golf club he became the first african american accepted into the extremely exclusive bloomfield hills country club in  an event that attracted little media attention—but when another african american auto industry executive was rejected for membership two years later some called for richie to resign from the club in solidarity richie’s “admission made a powerful statement to a sport that had been sullied by charges of racial discrimination” wrote detroit free press columnist doron levin but when roy roberts head of general motors pontiacgmc division was refused membership the bloomfield hills country club was accused of racism several white general motors executives resigned in protest but insiders told levin politics played far more a role— among the highpowered corporate executives that made up the club’s ranks some possibly affiliated with competing automakers had long resented what they saw as weightthrowing on the part of general motors executives richie allegedly did his own investigation of his club’s membership policies and the roberts incident and found no discrimination roberts was admitted in  after a second bid richie retired from chrysler in a management reshuffle that became effective in early  he took on an increasingly higher profile in his adopted home sitting on numerous local boards and even being named to a transition team for a new mayoral administration in detroit in  though he was not technically a resident of the city his duties on the team involved the law and publicsafety sectors of the city government he has also become chair of the board of directors for the highland park development corporation a nonprofit agency set up to lure economic investment to highland park michigan this small economically disadvantaged city is enclosed by detroit and served as home to chrysler world headquarters until mids with casino gaming arriving in detroit as the year  neared some large casino operators—needing local minority investors—tried to lure richie but he

start making the decision going to college pursuing an advanced degree or obtaining an industry recognized certificate is one of the most important decisions an individual will make in their lifetime when considering an educational institution there are numerous factors that need to be taken into account before an education decision can be made  here are the main factors to consider when looking at pursuing an advanced degree or completing a certificate program online vs in person this is the first fundamental question that prospective students need to ask themselves if you are the kind of person that is self driven has a tight schedule or is not in a commutable distance to an in person institution then pursuing an online degree could be a good fit however if you find yourself needing to be in a physical classroom environment and learn better that way then you should seek out in person programs that can better suite your needs people learn in all different kinds of ways some are visual learners some experiential and some need to hear things to have the information really sink in no one knows himself or herself better than you so listen to your gut and first determine what kind of learner you are before embarking on the next steps rasmssen college goes into greater depth about the plusses and minuses of online vs traditional educational settings  career opportunities when exploring areas of study that you are interested in one recommendation is to first explore the types of jobs and careers in that industry often times people find that after obtaining a degree that has set them back a significant amount of money that the career field that they have their degree in is either not growing or is underpaid in relation to the cost of the degree we suggest exploring a variety of careers and use the information contained here in conjunction with the bureau of labor and statistics data to determine if you are making a wise investment in your degree all of the statistics we have assembled on career and degree data come from the bls website and are intended to help students make wise decisions about their studies and career options with a degree or certificate    time commitment the amount of time that you have available to apply to your studies is going to be one of the most important factors in your decision if you are working a full time job you will have to figure out a way of balancing your personal life with your schoolwork this article from us news and world report will help you come up with a game plan for managing your time financial aid scholarships and student loans once you have decided that you want to go to college and have a career path planned out once you obtain your degree then it’s time to figure out how to pay for the degree most institutions have different financing options that you will have to do your homework on but all usually have some form of financial aid or scholarships available when looking for information on student aid and the resources available to students we recommend starting at the federal student aid website this is an office of the us department of education and here students will find a wealth of resources and information that will help them better determine what kind of aid or grants are available to them student financial aid popular college degrees and programs online
