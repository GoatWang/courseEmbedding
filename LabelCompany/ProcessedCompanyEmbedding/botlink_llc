partnership  agfundernews search search for company profiles exits and ma industry drone software developer botlink and hardware developer packet digital announce new partnership june   lauren manning leave a comment aerobotic innovations a drone control and safety application announced recently that it has partnered with packet digital llc to offer new products that will combine their respective stateoftheart software and hardware technologies the partnership will operate under aerobotic innovations’ existing botlink brand name according to aerobatic innovations ceo shawn muehler “we are taking two amazing technologies—software and hardware—and combining them in a way that no one else in the entire world has done quite yet”   in  a team of military and professional pilots software developers electrical engineers and communicators created botlink the company set out to create the world’s safest and most secure drone operations platform “we put safety at the top of the list because without safety you cannot realistically fly a drone without the threat of harming someone else” says muehler including his time as an officer in the us air force muehler has been flying both manned and unmanned aircraft for over a decade noticing a lack of safety solutions for uav users pilots and airports muehler saw the need for a service with an emphasis on safety   the company currently offers a software platform that provides farmers and other drone users with a complete picture of the airspace around them “let’s say you are looking at a map of your fields and you know that there is a particular field with wind towers using your smart phone or tablet device you can draw a circle around the wind tower and the drone will not fly into it” known as geofencing this tool allows farmers to fly with ease and alleviates the frustrations associated with navigating around objects manually   “farmers usually don’t have aviation experience with botlink they can immediately know who is around him where the tree lines are and where property lines are located” explained muehler “essentially we took the high level knowledge of a pilot and made it easy to digest for the farmer”   in addition to genofencing botlink platforms offer a variety of realworld safety features including realtime or near realtime manned and unmanned aircraft overlays with aircraft avoidance alerts and traffic advisories the application also features complete regulatory compliance and includes temporary flight restrictions active military operations and restricted airspace areas additionally the company’s cloudbased platform features fully automated drone control with manual draganddrop hand flying that can be performed right from a smart phone or tablet   as a standalone product botlink’s software application offers many advantages to farmers possessing even a novice experience with drones and aviation combined with packet digital’s cutting edge technologies however muehler sees the partnership as poised to gain momentum in the agtech industry   packet digital ceo terri zimmerman agrees “bringing botlink’s drone control and safety software together with packet digital’s efficient drone hardware creates the most robust and powerful cloud based operations platform in the industry”   packet digital is in the business of designing developing and marketing advanced power management solutions for portable electronic devices and embedded systems the company’s patented ondemand power technology and powersage integrated circuits lead to extended battery life in portable electronic devices and help consumer electronic companies and military outfits to develop faster smarter and smaller products many of packet digital’s products have found their way into military equipment   “current market averages for drones are about  minutes to one hour and fifteen minutes for flight time so realistically you can only get about  acres done in one shot before having to land the drone and download the files” said muehler after partnering with packet digital botlink is on track to increase flight times significantly “what we are doing with the new platform is increasing electronic efficiencies by four times”   not only will botlink drones fly longer they will also offer realtime data distribution and realtime photo stitching while some may see this service as a better fit for largescale operations muehler recognizes a real agronomic opportunity for smallscale operations as well “i think everyone will want this platform because of the fact that the return on investment for the end user is so great you can get much more data in real time back to you in a shorter timeframe”   when it comes to smallscale farmers who often lack the labor resources of larger outfits muehler thinks that “beaming data back to their device or home computer in real time is the only option that makes sense” currently botlink offers its safety platform for free and muehler plans to keep it that way the botlink professional package offers farmers operating up to five drones with security services up to  acres per month in photo stitching cloud data storage interdevice communication and its complete drone aviation safety package botlink enterprise geared toward largescale operations offers  acres per month in photo stitching unlimited cloud data storage and a host of other features including the safety package   zimmerman will serve as botlink’s ceo while muehler will take on the roll of coo according to muehler “the newly formed botlink llc enables us to accelerate our time to market by leveraging the experience and expertise of both companies terri’s business experience and her team’s hardware knowledge are the perfect compliments to our strong aviation and software background”   the joint venture has also set its sights on raising  million to launch its cloudbased operations platform for drones when asked about the current progress toward achieving this goal muehler said “it’s a pretty safe bet so far”   have news or tips email mediaagfundercom related storiessalinas mayor joe gunter sees  billion future for salinas

drone fargo partnership marisa jackels emergingprairie june    am  shares two fargobased companies botlink and packet digital announced that they are joining forces to create a drone platform which will not only allow pilots to track their drone flights in realtime but to fly their drones using solar energy for up to four hours – x as long as today’s average flight time they are launching the joint venture as a new company botlink llc and intend to raise  million to launch their platform by july already they have raised  million botlink a product of aerobotic innovations llc is a drone control and safety application that enables pilots to track their drone in realtime view any other manned and unmanned aircraft in the surrounding airspace and communicate with other pilots via cellular network it’s a yearold product being developed by a team of drone military pilots and both software and mechanical engineers packet digital is a yearold company that develops autonomous systemlevel power management with a focus on power savings recently they partnered with the department of defense to create a solar powered endless endurance drone what they developed through solar panels on the wings and maximum power point tracking mppt is the ability for a drone to fly for up to  hours whereas currently average flight cycles for drones are  minutes “it’s a perfect merge” muehler said “we aerobotic innovations are doing all the cellular technology and the software and then packet digital is doing all the internal electronic efficiencies in the drone” with this platform muehler said drones move from being a toy to an actual viable product botlink is targeting the commercial market zimmerman said where a highendurance drone could benefit work like media broadcasting weather monitoring or search and rescue for example their technology will also prevent drone crash landings such as the recent one from google by having power sensors that enable the drone to land upright zimmerman said “i think we will really enable the industry” she said botlink llc will first combine efforts and technologies on their cellular drone communications device that allows realtime distribution of data the drone is collecting sent back to the user’s device or computer as well as facilitating beyond line of site drone control – all through existing cellular networks they are also hiring looking for about nine software developers “it just made sense” it took a trip to a drone conference in atlanta georgia for the two fargo companies to get talking muehler and zimmerman both traveled to check out the top notch drone tech at the auvsi association for unmanned vehicle systems international conference in early may but what they saw was a scramble goldrush style to build more of the same “it was a mess” muehler said “everybody’s trying to build different versions of a mousetrap… nobody’s actually working on a complete platform that enables every drone to do anything” on day one muehler and zimmerman met to discuss what they were seeing they had not even ordered their lunch when they realized the potential in combining their expertise in hardware and software “it just made sense” zimmerman said “it was like a light bulb moment of why are we not doing this together because we can completely take the entire industry by storm if we can put this into one package” muehler added “it’s been a rocket ship ever since” in a little under three weeks botlink and packet digital had formed their joint venture and are now planning to get their platform to market by the end of june zimmerman said already they have spoken with potential customers and investors and are receiving responses that are “very positive” she said “everyone from dod guys to commercialists to hobbyists – they’re all really excited” muehler said building out of fargo the partnership of botlink and packet digital is a testimony to fargo’s style zimmerman and muehler agreed if they hadn’t met at a chamber of commerce dinner here they might not have talked in atlanta zimmerman said moreover the collaborative environment allowed for a smooth positive transition combining the two companies “people genuinely want other people to do well” zimmerman said “i sense that among companies and entrepreneurs here in fargo when shawn and i started talking about where the industry was going and what we needed to do as a company there wasn’t a guardedness of ‘what will you take of mine’ or ‘what’s better for me’ it was ‘what’s better in general’ there was immediate trust of what could we build together that would be better than what we could build separate” what they can build together according to the two teams is something quite remarkable “you’re taking two incredibly advanced products into one platform” muehler said “there wasn’t any question about it this was really the only way forward” “i haven’t questioned it since” zimmerman added “i don’t think anybody will be as far along as we are” story photos courtesy of marisa jackels tags botlink drones fagro startups packet digital uavs did you like this article no yes get more delivered to your inbox just like it sign up
