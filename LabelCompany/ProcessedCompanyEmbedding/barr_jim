common patterns that can put sound bible interpretation out of reach barr’s analysis drew a good deal of criticism and was explosive in evangelical circles however  years later barr’s conclusions still demand serious consideration this book poses questions that are essential for all serious bible students to wrestle with about the author james barr – was an old testament scholar noted for his contributions to the study of biblical languages his book the semantics of the biblical languages remains one of the most influential books on the subject he held professorships at the university of

chemistry when mr luthy ignited a large jug of methanol vapor that singed the ceiling tile leaving a discolored ring i took an advanced chemistry course the subsequent year and have been immersed in the discipline ever since i attended freedhardeman university fhu after high school and graduated with a degree in chemistry and a minor in mathematics my intention was to continue into pharmaceutical research but i always had this nagging interest in physics and at the last moment decided to go on to graduate school to pursue a degree in chemical physics i attended the university of nevada reno unr after graduating from fhu and had the opportunity to take part in several different research projects as well as work with the department of energy at sandia national laboratory in their combustion research facility i worked with dr cline at unr and was fortunate to have great success in our projects involved in chemical dynamics and molecular control in  after graduation i decided to return to fhu currently i am finishing my phd in chemistry through the university of memphis with research focusing on the spectral properties of nobel metal nanoparticles i was greatly blessed while a student at fhu the faculty were considerate and encouraging and the christian atmosphere was nurturing such that i can truly say that i would not be the person i am today without fhu my desire is to continue to help provide a place of learning that will foster academic excellence as well as spiritual growth and maturity   x curriculum vita education current phd in chemistry university of memphis

contact about us contact us about us about jim barr jim barr first was introduced to emu oil products in  from a well known emu expert who held a blueprint for a processing emu oil by  the processing was still not in operation and experiencing challenges after coming to an agreement with the owner jim barr moved to alabama to take over as supervisor of construction to solve these challenges this was to be the first processing house to be built exclusively to produce emu oil products after redoing the floor plan and fabricating the necessary equipment to process emu oil the company moved forward and passed usda inspection and also obtained e u european union approval while there jim oversaw day to day plant operations hired all labor and purchased all supplies at the same time he also began to work in a public relations role with emu farmers later detria mccleery and he decided to begin nature�s partner to launch the highest quality emu oil and emu oil products her role as financial officer and marketing representative has helped propel nature�s partner to the forefront of their industry as the company has grown jim was able to continually improve many products and develop new ones that were consistently superior to others on the market jim says when formulating a product my first priority is to stay as completely all natural as possible i have also found that combining my knowledge of emu oil with a retired pharmacist or special formulators in product labs gives me great ideas on what to add to the oil for designing a new product or improving an existing product these steps have propelled nature�s partner and jim and detria�s company into expanded retail sales as well as large wholesale accounts jim gives talks around the country on the benefits of
