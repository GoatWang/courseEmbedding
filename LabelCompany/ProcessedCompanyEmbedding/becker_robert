testimonials “take back your power”  robert c beck dsc micropulsing magnetic pulsing ionic colloidal silver ozonating water gentle electricity heals micropulsing is zapping the blood with electricity the electricity used is a very gentle form known as microcurrents microcurrents have been used in medical devices like pacemakers tens devices and others for many decades microcurrents of electricity are considered safe micropulsing the application we are going to discuss involves applying gentle microcurrents to the blood these microcurrents are created using a unit powered by a small battery the microcurrents are introduced to the body by placing two small electrodes on the wrist there are two arteries in each arm that come close to the surface at the wrists the electrodes are targeting these two arteries in  a remarkable discovery was made two medical doctors stephen kaali and william lyman from the albert einstein college of medicine in new york city discovered that applying microcurrents to cultured white blood cells infected with viruses disabled the viruses without affecting normal healthy cells in  the potential of this research discovery was announced in science news magazine zapping the aids virus with low–voltage electric current can nearly eliminate its ability to infect human white blood cells cultured in the laboratory  william d lyman and his colleagues found that exposure to  to  microamperes of electricity—comparable to that produced by a cardiac pacemaker—reduced the infectivity of the aids virus hiv by  to  percent their experiments  showed that the shocked viruses lost the ability to make an enzyme crucial to their reproduction and could no longer cause the white cells to clump together—two key signs of virus infection the finding could lead to tests of implantable electrical devices or dialysis–like blood treatments in hiv–infected patients lyman says in addition he suggests that blood banks might use electricity to zap hiv and vaccine developers might use electrically incapacitated viruses as the basis for an aids vaccineeditor’s note emphasis is ours the following year after interviewing dr steven kaali longevity magazine added  most of the aids viruses in a blood sample will lose their infectious capability after being zapped by a very low–level current repeated exposure appears to leave blood virtually free of hiv as well as hepatitis—without harming blood cells it is important to note that the research in the lab at albert einstein college of medicine was based on taking the blood out of the body to expose it to microcurrents and was conducted in a laboratory setting so what happened as a result of this groundbreaking research what happened since  to improve health and save lives all over the world nothing the patent filed based on this research was sold and nothing more happened modern medicine has ignored this astounding discovery enter bob beck check out real life stories the beck protocol brought

sensitive instrumentation and exploring electromedicine for most of his career in  when he learned of the research by kaali and lyman he was immediately inspired “it occurred to me in a flash of light why take the blood out of the body why not leave it in there where it belongs” micropulsing was born based on all the research bob beck was already aware of he felt this discovery would have far wider applications than any one disease he wondered if this was a way our creator had left a backdoor to help our bodies heal—using electricity it would take only a few years to show that electricity does indeed have far wider applications for healing bob beck believed the public had a right to choose to use safe simple technology bob’s design for passing microcurrents through blood brought the use of gentle electricity for healing directly to the public his design allowed micropulsing to be easily used at home the office or outdoors bob affectionately called applying microcurrents to blood “blood electrification” he also described his unit as a “blood purifier” or as a “blood cleaner” bob beck’s inspiration to apply gentle electricity to the blood in an easytouse way worked—it boosted the body’s ability to heal itself how to use the bob beck unit the micropulsing unit to apply microcurrents for blood electrification is simple to use—two electrodes are placed on the skin over the arteries on each side of the wrist one electrode is placed over the radial artery on the thumb side of the wrist and the other electrode is placed over the ulnar artery on the little finger side of the wrist the blood comes closer to the surface of the skin at these pulse points the basic protocol suggests building up the time from as little as  minutes a day to a minimum of two hours or more per day micropulsing may speed up the normal body cleansing process referred to as detoxification or detoxing starting slowly helps avoid any flulike or other detox symptoms building up to a minimum of two hours a day is suggested in order to expose enough of the circulating blood to the microcurrents being applied to the wrist bob stressed the importance of drinking plenty of water when micropulsing to help eliminate toxins once started micropulsing should be applied for a minimum of six weeks for more serious challenges and for details on a maintenance program we’ve created a handy reference guide guide to using the beck protocol the electrical nature of the body it turns out the electrical nature of the body has long been studied by researchers electrically speaking dr harold saxton burr phd discovered that sick body cells such as cancer cells have a different voltage than normal healthy cells is it possible that micropulsing helps restore normal voltage to unhealthy cells we also know the body has an awesome ability to heal itself when the immune system is working well research done in switzerland and reported in science  vie has shown that white blood cells a key part of the blood’s immune system function electrically our white blood cells electrocute diseasecausing pathogens in the blood to explore fascinating ways electricity helps us heal check “microcurrents for healing” microcurrents for healing given the evidence for the electrical nature of our bodies and the healing process it is not so surprising that adding a mild flow of electricity to the blood by simply placing electrodes over the two main arteries on the wrist would boost the body’s ability to heal itself the beck protocol is born currently the effectiveness of micropulsing has not gained mainstream medical attention however its popularity continues to grow among those looking for more natural ways to health today individuals share their testimonials with others and with us about how they have restored their health the use of the beck units now spans the globe as bob gained experience with and received feedback from individuals using micropulsing he saw the need for three

among themselves that a common mechanism of action seems highly unlikely yet all report excellent clinical results serious questions are raised concerning the validity of the claims the mechanism of action and the possibility of longterm undesirable side effects these questions are not insoluble and the newer physical science disciplines seem well suited to reveal the mechanism of action appropriate research projects must be mounted and answers to these questions obtained before the technique is made available for wide application the importance of this procedure far transcends

then spend the rest of the night awake i now can sleep straight through even with bathroom breaks while it didnt fix my narcolepsy because narcolepsy is a chemical deficiency in the brain i still experience knockout episodes during the day when sitting in a chair but it is not as severe also be prepared for more intense dreams i have also used the unit to directly treat specific pain areas on my body and it has reduced the pain i have slept with it under the mattress as well as in the bed i adjust the strength accordingly and the benefit is just as effective i am a massage therapist and i tape it under the massage table and several clients have reported a strong calming effect i use  hz for those sessions the portability for traveling is also a great feature i wouldnt be without this unit ron patzer gaby ross   jan  i dont have sleep problems but i bought my earthpulse unit to help heal a back and hip injury that i had over a year ago for several months i couldnt put any weight on my leg and could barely lift it a few inches off the floor after much research i learned about the amazing benefits of pemf therapy but the prices of most systems out there were beyond my means then i discovered earthpulse and after careful research and comparisons i decided to buy the least expensive model with only one magnet last august i didt know how my body would react to the earthpulses pemf so i started at very low settings after about three weeks my back pain was much less and could lift my leg higher ive been using my ep unit almost  and now im using hz at the highest amplitude setting  the back pain disappeared a couple of months ago for good i can now put quite a bit of weight on my leg and lift it almost  inches higher than before i started using the ep unit i wish i had started at the higher settings from the beginning so my healing would have gone faster anyway im very happy with the results so far and im considering buying the model with two magnets customer service has been great i had many questions both before purchasing and after receiving the unit and they answered quickly i would highly recommend an earthpulse unit to anyone simon foong   dec  its amazing and everyone should own one im sleeping better and feel more energized thank you earthpulse rick contreras   jul  im not sure the earth pulse is for me there are times i seen to sleep well followed by nights when i cant shut down my brain long enough for sleep to come my nightwork daysleep cant be helping this but this is the career i chose i have tried the different settings hz but they dont really make a big difference in my overall sleep qualityquantity maybe some further instructionadvice from sleep tech would be helpful i do appreciate the chance to try this unit out and ill be genuinely sorry to have to send it back maryam jawid   oct  i had extremely high hopes for the earthpulse as i have always had sleep troubles when i broke my ankle i decided to finally purchase an earthpulse in order to not only improve sleep but to use the magnet on my ankle to speed healing now after  days of trying different frequencies and amplitudes i have noticed almost no improvement in sleep quality as for the ankle i had to stop using the earthpulse on the ankle after about a month because my healing was actually going slower than what is typical and putting the magnet on my ankle just caused more pain i hate to leave this unhappy review but i highly encourage anyone considering an earthpulse to try to borrow one from someone before purchasing they do have a  day return policy but shipping is never refunded and that cost is more than a  dollar loss already larry hairston   jan  as i have aged it has become more difficult for me to get to sleep and stay asleep that is why i bought the earthpulse i was having so much difficulty sleeping that the ep did not work for me at first i guess it was difficult for my body to get in rhythm with the device but after several weeks although i still sometimes have trouble getting to sleep once asleep i am experiencing deep restorative sleep often dreaming and sleeping longer i have mostly used program mode  so that may be why i sometimes still have trouble falling asleep i would definitely recommend the ep to anyone with insomnia see all reviews contact us feel free to reach out to us if you have any queries our faqs section
