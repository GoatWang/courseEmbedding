ali is still commanding big dollarson wednesday under armour announced that it has signed a deal to make an extensive line of ali branded and inspired products by partnering with authentic brands group abg which bought alis estate and licensing rights in  terms of the deal werent disclosedunder armour is launching a product line featuring muhammad ali pictured above in  the ring magazinegetty imagesa limited edition graphic tshirt goes on sale wednesday to launch the partnership with a lifestyle apparel line rolling out next month in november alis name and image will be on training apparel footwear and accessorieshes an iconic hero from the past and a true innovator said glenn silbert vice president of mens outdoors and team sports for under armour we wondered what ali would have been like if he had a brand like ours when he was getting started and how great it could have been that has been the mentality of our design team throughout this processnick woodhouse president and chief marketing officer of abg said under armour is irreverent disruptive they pivot quickly and theyre explosive those words also speak to ali and how he changed the gameunder armour has dipped its toe in the water with licensing boxing names through its roots of fight line which recreated retro bruce lee mike tyson and boom boom mancini products but the ali effort promises to be more than images and slogansnontraditional training is on the rise and ali was one of the pioneers of working out outside the gym shunning weights and lifting logswe are truly flattered to have under armour pay homage to muhammad in such a significant way his wife lonnie said in a statement we see in the under armour brand a similar spirit and drive that pushed muhammad to be such a groundbreaking forceali in years past had previously been signed by adidas which unveiled a retro shoe and had a commercial in which ali was digitally imposed to create a fight between him and his daughter laila but product releases were few and far betweenunder armour will treat him differently woodhouse said we see this more as an endorsement than a licensing deal hell be more of an athlete that they think about at  am on a monday than  pm on a fridaysilbert said the retailers reaction to ali who is still one of the most recognized people in the world was unanimouswe spoke to our partners outside the building who we do business with and asked them how theyd respond to ali products and the immediate response was do it lets go silbert saidali who turned  last month has parkinsons disease which limits his capacity to physically do much to promote the dealmuhammad ali enterprises which is controlled by abg owns more than  trademarks including his name king of boxing cassius clay float like a butterfly sting like a
