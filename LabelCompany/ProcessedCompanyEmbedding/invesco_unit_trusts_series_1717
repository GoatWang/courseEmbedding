avg pb   weighted avg market cap mm   each key stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself the portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next distribution date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus  the estimated annual income per unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trusts initial offering period and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter this amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends the actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trusts fees and expenses in dividends and distributions received currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities the actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trusts life  the portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the unitholders basis in the units and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors as of the close of business day prior to initial date of deposit the actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the portfolios fees and expenses in actual income received by the portfolio currency fluctuations and with changes in the portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities the trust portfolio is

your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts if available you will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time the portfolio does not replicate all of the components of the sp
