club compare all chatter on the street caesars makes another move to insulate healthy subsidiaries lisa allen may    am edt new york the deal  las vegasbased casino operator caesars entertainment czr has taken another step to protect its healthier subsidiaries from a potential bankruptcy filing at the debtladen operating unit a may  regulatory filing revealed the terms of a new sharedservices agreement that transfers ownership of intellectual property and popular loyalty rewards programs that were previously whollyowned by the troubled operating unit caesars entertainment operating co ceoc into a new joint venture controlled by ceoc caesars entertainment resort properties llc cerp and a vehicle created last year caesars growth partners holdings llc cgph the jv called caesars enterprise services llc will be majorityowned by ceoc  while cerp will hold  and cgp will hold  all the parties however will have equal voting rights with some veto privileges afforded to ceoc the implicit rationale seems to be an attempt to shield cerp and cgph from a ceoc bankruptcy creditsights inc analysts said in a may  report creditsights analyst christopher snow said by phone on thursday that he doesnt think the agreement is designed to create opportunities to strip ceoc of its rights to use the intellectual property and loyalty programs but rather to protect cerp and cgphs rights to use them in case of a bankruptcy the provisions of the agreement state that if any member of caesars enterprise services files for bankruptcy it will lose its governance rights in the jv if ceoc filed for bankruptcy for example it would still have rights to the intellectual property but it would lose the ability to control how its jv partners used it royaltyfree as creditsights understands it the may  report calls this provision absurd if ceocs creditors were to take control of the unit during a bankruptcy restructuring this jv agreement would prevent the creditors from trying to cordon off the ip and rewards program within ceoc snow said the bondholders in the ceoc structure are going to litigate on a lot of grounds snow said citing concerns that asset transfers out of ceoc constitute fraudulent conveyance and also that the recent cancellation of the parent companys guarantee of ceocs debt wasnt permissible under certain bond indentures this sharedservices contract is also going to be litigated he said concluding i think this is going to get tied up with everything in the potential bankruptcy caesars and its private equity sponsors apollo global management llc and tpg capital lp have been working to revamp caesars entertainments capital structure creating new business units selling assets between units and refinancing debt to push back maturities if you liked this article you
