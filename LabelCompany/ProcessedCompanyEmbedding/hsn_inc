resolution format at launch it was carried by time warner cable and verizon fios it has since been added by other providers such as comcast and att uverse when the hd channel launched the network had a different presentation than most hd channels choosing to present content on the standard definition feed using a left cut of the hd image rather than taken from the center of the screen within the

television in  the frequencies of hse were sold to mediaset and the channel was renamed mediashopping in  home shopping europe bought the channel back the channel was renamed hse technologyedit call centeredit hsn national started life with a standard rotary phone system that concentrated calls to the front of the queue this corresponded to the front row of order takers in the hsn studio at the levitz center so named as the location was a former levitz furniture store in clearwater florida after several months this system was no longer adequate and hsn entered a phase where a phone system from gte was used hsn claimed that the systems inability to handle the high call volumes resulted in a loss of business hsn sued gte for  billion in a counterlibel suit gte claimed that hsn had slandered the company gte won a  million judgment both parties settled out of court in the interim hsn found another telephone vendor to handle its call volume the rockwell corporations galaxy line of switches was used for the current call center as well as the new locations in st petersburg hsn has an inhouse call center in st petersburg florida which mostly handles customer service calls hsn also employs several hundred customer service representatives from work at home positions who take calls and place orders via hsns customer service intranet hsn also contracts call centers to handle its sales calls especially when hsn is broadcasting shows with highly popular items interactive voice responseedit hsn was an early adopter of an interactive voice response ivr system for order entry this system allowed customers to place orders through the ivr rather than an agent the original ivr was a product supplied by precision software incorporated psi of st paul minnesota the product made use of an intel pc chassis and dialogic boards for call termination as the system also needed to communicate with the burroughs mainframe it used a serial connection to communicate with the online application while psi had offtheshelf components it required a great deal of customization to create scripts and interface with the order entry system psi ran up a high amount of hours and this caused hsn to actually purchase psi rather than pay their bill once released the system was branded tootie after the bicycle horn that show hosts used to help excite the audience and was the networks mascot up until the mids as the size of hsns call center kept increasing it decided to create a new ivr platform that could handle more load as nothing available on the open market could handle the volume hsn required the psi subsidiary started work on a customer platform called the tsp this platform was installed in hsns new facility and could handle a large number of t lines each t has a capacity of  separate callers this system originally communicated through a stratus computer acting as a pollselect terminal gateway to the mainframe but this was later changed to a direct tcpip connection this system was dubbed tootie ii internally competitorsedit jewelry television evine see alsoedit ballard designs home shopping host shopping channel qvc hsn competitor qvcs first competitor ktould

acronym intended the television channel home order television in  the frequencies of hse were sold to mediaset and the channel was renamed mediashopping in  home shopping europe bought the channel back the channel was renamed hse technologyedit call centeredit hsn national started life with a standard rotary phone system that concentrated calls to the front of the queue this corresponded to the front row of order takers in the hsn studio at the levitz center so named as the location was a former levitz furniture store in clearwater florida after several months this system was no longer adequate and hsn entered a phase where a phone system from gte was used hsn claimed that the systems inability to handle the high call volumes resulted in a loss of business hsn sued gte for  billion in a counterlibel suit gte claimed that hsn had slandered the company gte won a  million judgment both parties settled out of court in the interim hsn found another telephone vendor to handle its call volume the rockwell corporations galaxy line of switches was used for the current call center as well as the new locations in st petersburg hsn has an inhouse call center in st petersburg florida which mostly handles customer service calls hsn also employs several hundred customer service representatives from work at home positions who take calls and place orders via hsns customer service intranet hsn also contracts call centers to handle its sales calls especially when hsn is broadcasting shows with highly popular items interactive voice responseedit hsn was an early adopter of an interactive voice response ivr system for order entry this system allowed customers to place orders through the ivr rather than an agent the original ivr was a product supplied by precision software incorporated psi of st paul minnesota the product made use of an intel pc chassis and dialogic boards for call termination as the system also needed to communicate with the burroughs mainframe it used a serial connection to communicate with the online application while psi had offtheshelf components it required a great deal of customization to create scripts and interface with the order entry system psi ran up a high amount of hours and this caused hsn to actually purchase psi rather than pay their bill once released the system was branded tootie after the bicycle horn that show hosts used to help excite the audience and was the networks mascot up until the mids as the size of hsns call center kept increasing it decided to create a new ivr platform that could handle more load as nothing available on the open market could handle the volume hsn required the psi subsidiary started work on a customer platform called the tsp this platform was installed in hsns new facility and could handle a large number of t lines each t has a capacity of  separate callers this system originally communicated through a stratus computer acting as a pollselect terminal gateway to the mainframe but this was later changed to a direct tcpip connection this system was dubbed tootie ii internally competitorsedit jewelry television evine see alsoedit ballard designs home shopping host shopping

combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and
