engaged capital i philosophy   we view ourselves as stewards of shareholder’s capital and believe by working constructively with company management and the board we become a catalyst for positive change in public companies the shareholder’s voice gets diluted due to distributed ownership and frequent shareholder turnover as a result it is common for management and boards to begin placing the “interests of the company” growth imperative before the interests of the owners return on investment owners often want to participate in the decision making process but don’t have a vehicle to do so engaged capital becomes the voice for the shareholders we bring an owner’s point of view to the governance and decision making process in a helpful constructive way through a combination of concentrated ownership positions ranging from  of portfolio companies a longterm perspective  year holding periods deep research and valueadded insights for increasing the companys worth engaged

approximately  of the outstanding common stock of heartware international inc “htwr” or the “company” we informed you of our opposition to the proposed acquisition of valtech cardio ltd “valtech” in our letter dated december   the htwr board of directors the “board” has decided to ignore our valid position and to move forward with a shareholder vote on the valtech acquisition as a result we are compelled to publicly detail the substantial concerns we and other significant shareholders share regarding the valtech acquisition proposal including  the rationale for pursuing valtech is flawed  management’s investor day forecast for valtech is misleading  htwr’s vad franchise is undervalued  the milestone acceleration provision serves as a tenyear poison pill  the valtech acquisition entrenches the board and management team at the expense of htwr shareholders the rationale for pursuing valtech is flawed htwr has focused on cardioband as the key valuecreating asset in the valtech portfolio that justifies the acquisition of valtech – no surprise given it is the only device within the valtech portfolio expected to generate any material revenue for the next five years management has cited the performance of abbott’s mitraclip and the “conventional wisdom” that mitral valve repair is preferable to mitral valve replacement in the treatment of mitral regurgitation as some of the reasons to believe cardioband will generate significant revenues for htwr as we outline below this thesis is based on tenuous assumptions and ignores the significant clinical competitive and regulatory risks facing the device first brand new clinical data calls into question the thesis that transcatheter repair of mitral regurgitation “mr” will continue to be preferred to transcatheter replacement an article posted to the new england journal of medicine website on november   contained updated two year data from the cardiothoracic surgical trials network’s study comparing mitral valve repair to mitral valve replacement in patients with severe ischemic mr significantly this is the only randomized trial that compares the outcomes of mitral valve repair vs mitral valve replacement in patients with mr the results of this study are not supportive of a robust future for mitral valve repair to quote the authors emphasis added “the rate of recurrence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation over  years was higher in the repair group than in the replacement group  vs  p there were no significant betweengroup differences in rates of serious adverse events and overall readmissions but patients in the repair group had more serious adverse events related to heart failure p   and cardiovascular readmissions p   on the minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire there was a trend toward greater improvement in the replacement group p   ” digging further into the published data reveals that on nearly every measure of cardiovascular adverse events the replacement arm outperformed the repair arm again to quote the authors emphasis added “…we observed that the recurrence of mitral regurgitation which was mostly moderate in degree remained a progressive and excess hazard for patients undergoing mitralvalve repair… this deficiency in the durability of correction of mitral regurgitation is disconcerting given that recurrence confers a predisposition to heart failure atrial fibrillation and repeat interventions and hospitalizations we found that patients in the repair group had more serious adverse events of heart failure and hospital readmission for cardiovascular causes” not only did patients in the replacement arm have less cardiovascular adverse events these patients also had a better quality of life than patients in the repair arm “the findings of the minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire although not conclusive were consistent with these clinical events the point difference in average improvement over baseline in favor of the replacement group was not significant p   but the magnitude of change exceeded the point threshold for clinically meaningful improvement used in other studies” historically the preference for mitral valve repair over replacement was driven by the presumption that while both were equally effective at correcting mr repair was the safer procedure this landmark study – the first of its kind – demonstrates that not only is the safety advantage associated with repair statistically insignificant repair is clearly inferior to replacement in preventing the recurrence of mr and on many clinical measures the outcomes for patients receiving repair were inferior at  years what does this mean for transcatheter mitral valve repair devices like cardioband as transcatheter mitral valve replacement devices are developed and refined it is quite likely any periprocedural safety advantage associated with repair both surgical and transcatheter will diminish and may eventually vanish entirely as such we find it hard to believe cardioband will achieve the robust revenues projected by htwr management if transcatheter repair offers little if any safety advantage and is clearly inferior in durably correcting mr when compared to replacement second the path to us approval for cardioband is murky at best htwr management has already begun walking back their initial expectations for a late  us launch of cardioband recently saying that a  launch “hopefully is not overly ambitious” given that management is still “brainstorming” potential trial designs and has not yet had any formal meetings with the fda a  approval certainly appears to be an optimistic outcome we need only look to abbott’s mitraclip – the only transcatheter mitral valve repair device with us approval to date – to observe how long and risky the path to us approval will be for cardioband mitraclip secured us approval in  – a full  ½ years after receiving ce mark and only after two substantial clinical trials everest i and everest ii were conducted even then mitraclip barely squeaked by a  fda advisory panel vote for approval – which included five out of nine panel members voting against the efficacy of the device – and a sizeable postmarketing study was required nothing in the limited cardioband dataset suggests that it is any more efficacious than mitraclip – us approval is far from certain even if the pmaenabling trial of cardioband yields data supportive of approval the timeline for securing fda approval will likely stretch beyond  coapt abbott’s us trial comparing mitraclip to guidelinedirected medical therapy “gdmt” in surgeryineligible patients with mr has been enrolling for over  years and based on the pace of enrollment to date it will take at least another year to complete enrollment we are hardpressed to believe that htwr would be quicker than abbott in enrolling patients in a future cardioband pivotal trial assuming it takes six months to finalize a trial design and qualify study sites  years to enroll the trial as fast or faster than both everest ii and coapt enrollment one year of patient followup  months to analyze and publish results and  months of fda review time fda approval of cardioband – if it is approved at all – would not be secured until sometime between mid and the end of  third acquiring valtech would expose htwr shareholders to a significant risk that is completely out of the control of htwr and valtech management the results of the coapt trial itself the key opinion leaders who presented at htwr’s november   investor day “investor day” expressed concern that coapt will miss its illspecified primary endpoint superiority in reducing recurrent heart failure hospitalizations vs gdmt these same experts also stated that should this be the case “reimbursement will disappear… overnight” for mitraclip and any other transcatheter repair device including cardioband securing reimbursement for cardioband in the eu would then likely require positive results from a rigorous randomized and risky clinical trial – which would add years of additional expense and cash burn similarly the consequence of a negative coapt trial for cardioband would likely include increased scrutiny and more onerous approval requirements from the fda fourth there are numerous potential competitors to cardioband htwr management has portrayed the transcatheter mitral valve repair market as a twohorse race between mitraclip and cardioband indeed the financial forecast htwr management presented during their investor day assumes cardioband will hold  market share in transcatheter repair in the future this is to put it mildly an overly optimistic view of how the market will develop besides mitraclip there are at least  transcatheter mitral valve repair devices under development today at least ten of which are in human testing andor are already approved for use in europe this number does not consider the internal efforts underway by both edwards and medtronic to develop transcatheter repair technologies as well finally it is not realistic to ascribe meaningful value to any of valtech’s products outside of cardioband cardiovalve for mitral valve replacement has yet to reach firstinman and even then faces enormous risk in demonstrating it is a viable device edwards recently shelved its fortis valve for transcatheter mitral valve replacement only after a series of adverse events were observed in the first  patients receiving the device with all due respect to the rd team at valtech – if edwards the unquestionable leader in transcatheter approaches to structural heart repair with resources and expertise far beyond what valtech and htwr can call upon could not successfully internally develop a transcatheter mitral valve replacement device what probability of success can investors realistically assign to cardiovalve even if cardiovalve successfully overcomes the developmental and clinical hurdles to produce an approvable device htwr will be a late entrant to a highly competitive market we can identify at least  transcatheter mitral valve replacement technologies under development at least seven of which have achieved firstinman in comparison valtech’s cardiovalve device does not yet have a finalized design and even in a bestcase scenario is  months away from firstinman trials given the relative paucity of clinical data regarding the surgical treatment of tricuspid regurgitation and the absence of any meaningful data on transcatheter techniques to repair the tricuspid valve we view the opportunity for cardioband and cardiovalve in tricuspid repair and replacement as highly uncertain and of limited value as a result while htwr management may describe valtech as “quadrupling the number of milestones” ahead of the company we think there is a better term to describe these “milestones” risks management’s investor day forecast for valtech is misleading the s filed by htwr on october   contained four “representative cases” depicting management’s projections of valtech’s financial performance through  during htwr’s investor day management presented financial projections for valtech from “case ” – the secondmost optimistic case – to investors typically when management teams publicly present financial projections it is safe for investors to assume these forecasts represent management’s best estimate of the expected performance of the business in question however this is not true of the forecast htwr management presented for valtech at htwr’s investor day during the investor day htwr knowingly misled investors by presenting a forecast for valtech that is nearly  above management’s own probabilityweighted forecast for the business the indisputable evidence confirming our assertion is contained within the fairness opinion issued by the company’s own financial advisors the fairness opinion issued by canaccord genuity to htwr and published in the s is based upon htwr management’s probabilityadjusted revenue forecast for valtech it is a simple exercise to derive the revenue forecast supporting canaccord’s valuation calculations used in the fairness opinion the chart below illustrates the mismatch between htwr management’s probabilityadjusted internal forecast for valtech and the publiclypresented forecast highlighted at htwr’s investor day see graphic htwrs revenue projections for valtech it would not surprise us to hear management justify this after the fact by claiming that “case ” is now their best forecast for valtech revising longterm revenue and synergy forecasts upward is a common tactic used by managements to defend contested transactions such upward revisions generally lack credibility and are usually discarded as soon as the contest has ended management’s upward revision to their valtech forecast is no exception it strains credulity to believe that management’s revised forecast of how the mitral valve repair and replacement market will evolve over the next ten years will be any more accurate than the forecasts management provided to their financial advisors just a few months prior additionally the likelihood that htwr’s management team will still be in place ten years from now when the performance of valtech can actually be judged is low management therefore can promise the moon to htwr investors knowing full well that they are very unlikely to ever be held accountable for nor will their compensation be tied to achieving the optimistic forecast presented at htwr’s investor day finally even under the most wildly optimistic scenario provided in the s valtech will generate no meaningful cash flow until  therefore the entire value or lack thereof of the proposed transaction hinges on the performance of valtech and the state of the competitive environment at least  years from now no one not us not htwr management not valtech’s competitors and not the treating physicians can predict with any degree of certainty how the mitral valve repair and replacement market will develop over the next decade much less predict which companies and devices will succeed it is the peak of hubris for management to claim otherwise and rationalize taking on the enormous and unnecessary risks associated with valtech when there is a clear lowerrisk path to significant shareholder value creation executing in the company’s core vad business htwr’s vad franchise is undervalued given the significant amount of htwr stock to be issued to valtech shareholders upon the close of the transaction any evaluation of the proposed acquisition of valtech requires assessing the value of htwr shares the true cost of the valtech acquisition is not based on the currentlydepressed trading value of the htwr shares to be issued at the close of the transaction – it is based on the riskadjusted fair value of the company’s longterm standalone business plan while the recent disclosure of a handful of adverse events observed in the mvad ce mark trial is unfortunate the attractive fundamentals of htwr’s core vad franchise are unchanged from this summer when htwr shares were trading well above  barring a catastrophic mvad pump redesign – which by all accounts is highly unlikely – htwr shares should steadily close the gap to fair value as mvad returns to the clinic we believe the fair value of htwr shares is significantly greater than the current trading price during htwr’s investor day management provided their longterm forecast for the vad franchise projecting revenues of  million in  this scenario yields a  per share valuation for htwr at the end of  representing over  upside from today’s levels of course it is only prudent to examine a more conservative scenario for the core business htwr shares are undervalued even if we assume management’s forecast is aggressive under a scenario where vad revenues in  are only  million and revenue growth beyond  is a more modest  rather than the  projected by management fair value at the end of  would be  a share – a  premium from today’s levels we cannot comprehend if the board truly believes the forecast presented at investor day how the board can justify the valtech acquisition as being a superior riskadjusted alternative to simply executing in the company’s core business – a strategy which would double to triple the value of htwr in four years as a result it is false to portray the valtech acquisition as being “cheaper” now than it was when the acquisition announcement was disclosed – the  upfront dilution additional shares and warrants and  million in milestone payments remain unchanged even in the downside scenario discussed above the future value of the consideration offered to valtech exceeds  million in cash and stock – an amount greater than htwr’s current market capitalization additionally as we have stated previously we believe the ultimate destination of htwr’s vad portfolio is in the hands of a larger medical device manufacturer bankers and senior executives at other medical device companies including companies that are the likely acquirers of htwr have confirmed our shared view of the longterm attractiveness of the vad market it is clear that the potential acquirers of htwr are very familiar with the company and would be able to move quickly to evaluate acquiring htwr should the opportunity present itself now or in the future using the valuation multiple thoratec commanded in its sale to st jude the value of htwr’s longterm plan in an acquisition is  per share at the end of  – a  increase from today however should the company complete the acquisition of valtech we believe a sale to a strategic acquirer becomes unlikely as we discuss below due to the board’s apparent failure to properly serve as the shareholders’ fiduciaries the acquisition of valtech will slam the door on any potential future acquisition of htwr the milestone acceleration provision serves as a year poison pill our conversations with htwr shareholders revealed that many are either unaware or do not fully appreciate the impact of the milestone payment acceleration provision that the board agreed to as part of the valtech acquisition proposal as we detail below this provision has the potential to serve as a year entrenchment mechanism for htwr’s board and management team by creating a significant barrier to a future sale of the company we are obligated to highlight the significant cost and risk this provision imposes on htwr shareholders while benefiting the pecuniary interests of htwr’s board management team and the current owners of valtech the business combination agreement dated september   between htwr valtech and certain of their affiliates the “valtech acquisition agreement” provides that in the event htwr is acquired within  years post the closing of the valtech acquisition all of the milestone payments owed to valtech’s former owners accelerate and significantly lower the considerations htwr shareholders will receive in a sale specifically  the share milestone payment associated with firstinman “fim” trials of cardioband tricuspid or cardiovalve becomes immediately payable regardless of whether or not either product has achieved fim  the warrants to purchase  htwr shares at a strike price of  that vest upon achieving  million in trailing twelvemonth “ttm” revenues from valtech products immediately vest regardless of whether or not this level of revenue has been achieved   million of the  million milestone payment associated with achieving  million in ttm revenues from valtech products becomes immediately payable   million of the  million milestone payment becomes payable at a lowered ttm revenue threshold of  million rather than  million  the remaining  million of the  million milestone payment becomes payable at a lowered ttm revenue threshold of  million rather than  million it is important that all htwr directors take time to fully understand the implications of this acceleration provision for shareholders of the company the acceleration provision would force htwr’s acquirer to make milestones payments to valtech’s former owners regardless of valtech’s performance thus the raison dêtre of utilizing a milestone payment provision – to mitigate the damage to shareholders from the underperformance of an acquired asset – is rendered pointless for illustrative purposes let us assume that a potential acquirer of htwr is willing to pay  a share for the company prevaltech additionally assume this same acquirer values the valtech assets at  million due to the dilution and milestone acceleration provision associated with the valtech acquisition rather than receiving the full  per share htwr shareholders would instead only receive  a share in an acquisition a  discount to the prevaltech pershare value of the company the table below illustrates the price per share htwr shareholders would receive in an acquisition based on a range of values for htwr standalone and valtech     acquisition value of htwr postvaltech acquirers valuation of valtech m m   m   m   m   m htwr standalone acquisition price per share                               in order for htwr shareholders to actually receive the full  a share in an acquisition of htwr postvaltech the acquirer must assign a value to valtech in excess of  million – an amount greater than htwr’s current market capitalization this “breakeven” valuation for valtech only increases as the value of htwr’s core vad franchise increases the ramifications of the acceleration provision are troubling since the most logical acquirers of htwr already possess assets that would be either partly or wholly duplicative to valtech’s portfolio it is unlikely that these acquirers would assign much value to valtech unfortunately for htwr shareholders the acceleration provision would force these potential acquirers of htwr to pay full value for the valtech assets as a result this acceleration provision effectively serves whether intentionally or not as a tenyear poison pill rather than trading with an embedded ma premium like most of its midcap medical device peers the acquisition of valtech will cause htwr shares to trade with an ma discount the valtech acquisition entrenches the board and management team at the expense of shareholders our conversations with numerous bankers and industry executives have supported our assertion that  htwr’s ownership of valtech makes the former a less attractive acquisition target and  htwr’s offer was far in excess of other if any potential competing bids for valtech even industry experts and analysts who favorably view valtech’s products cannot justify the high price offered by htwr additionally the most likely potential acquirers of htwr have categorically expressed to us that they would have no interest in acquiring htwr should the valtech acquisition close this fact which directly contradicts claims being made by htwr’s management team is particularly disheartening as many htwr shareholders have an investment thesis predicated upon an eventual sale of the company to a large strategic acquirer at a significant premium while we agree with many of the company’s shareholders that the ultimate destiny for htwr is a sale to a strategic acquirer let us be clear – we are not advocating for a sale of the company today given the currently depressed share price and uncertainty regarding the restart of the mvad ce mark clinical trial we believe it is unlikely that the board would be able to negotiate a sale of the company at a premium that would be acceptable to shareholders today however it is unacceptable to htwr shareholders to permanently impair a future sale of htwr by acquiring an asset – valtech – which makes the company less attractive to the most likely acquirers perhaps the valtech acquisition proposal is a product of misaligned incentives between management and htwr shareholders it is not lost on us that the board and management team have collectively purchased a total of only  shares valued at  of htwr on the open market over the last five years while selling nearly  shares valued at  million over the same time period given the sparse shareholdings and past trading history of the board and management team investors are left to wonder if htwr leadership has an incentive to continue receiving and subsequently selling significant annual stock grants rather than positioning the company for an eventual sale unfortunately for htwr shareholders the valtech transaction would increase the likelihood that htwr remains independent and the annual stock grants keep flowing additionally the valtech transaction has the added consequence of disenfranchising current htwr shareholders should the acquisition of valtech close valtech and htwr would become whollyowned subsidiaries of a new corporation hw global inc conveniently for the board hw global as a newly formed company would not be required to hold a shareholder meeting for the election of directors until the spring of  additionally public disclosures show that the company intends to further disenfranchise independent shareholders by adopting a classified board structure so that only a third of directors will be up for election in each year some of htwr’s largest shareholders have expressed to us their desire shared by us to see new directors added to the board who possess the capital allocation and valuation expertise htwr so desperately needs denying shareholders’ ability to vote for board change by delaying the company’s annual meeting would only serve to further frustrate the owners of the company while highlighting the apparently selfserving decisionmaking of the board even if hw global chooses to hold its first annual meeting at an earlier date this would constitute a meaningless platitude as valtech shareholders and htwr insiders would together control approximately  of the new shares of hw global – making it almost impossible for the independent shareholders of htwr to have a meaningful say in any strategic or governance changes including the composition of the hw global board shareholder representation is needed in the boardroom we remain baffled by the decisionmaking process that led to the decision to acquire valtech we cannot comprehend how the board came to the conclusion that pursuing an incredibly risky expensive acquisition of a prerevenue company was a better riskadjusted alternative than continuing to execute in the company’s core vad business andor selling the company at a significant premium the inclusion of the acceleration provision in the valtech acquisition agreement and the establishment of hw global with numerous unfriendly governance features only increase our concerns regarding the board’s oversight since the acceleration provision and governance structure cannot benefit htwr shareholders under any scenario it is clear to us that the board either neglected or worse yet willfully ignored their fiduciary responsibilities to htwr shareholders in favor of their own interests and those of htwr management as a result we will campaign aggressively and forcefully against the proposed acquisition of valtech the board must terminate the valtech acquisition without delay as htwr shareholders we reiterate our call for the board to immediately terminate the valtech acquisition agreement we note that the valtech acquisition agreement gives the board the flexibility to change its recommendation of the transaction at any time every day and every dollar the board and management team spend on a futile campaign to defend this unjustifiable acquisition would be far better spent on the company’s core vad business rather than escalating this confrontation with shareholders put this strategic mistake behind us so as to minimize any further damage to htwr’s
