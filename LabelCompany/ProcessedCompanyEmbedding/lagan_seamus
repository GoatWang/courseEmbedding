all for joining us today we appreciate the opportunity to update you on our business and plans for rennova for  it has been no secret from our filings and previous communications the  was a very difficult year for core diagnostics business and the dramatic drop in revenue and cash flow from the toxicology diagnostics for substance abuse facilities at several adverse effects on our business throughout  marc will shortly give us the financial summary for  we believe we have made significant progress in the last quarter of  first quarter of  and stabilizing our core business and believe that the refocus sales efforts and success achieved combined with consolidation and cost cutting have created a new base from what we will again grew this sector of a business into a profitable and cash flow positive division by the end of the year i will let jack explain further in a few minutes our vision is to build a synergistic platform of needed services for the healthcare industry we believe we have made significant progress in achieving that vision and while the numbers for  created a picture of losses they do not reflect the developments and advances that have been made todate in the different divisions that rennova now operates i would like to explain that progress further rennova health inc through its subsidiaries is a provider of an expanding group of healthcare services for healthcare providers their patients and individuals we have historically operated our business under one management team starting in  to improve efficiency on progress and to provide additional clarity to our shareholders and investors we have started to separate our different business interests into four divisions with specific management to focus on and deliver value for all of us these four divisions can best be described as follow one clinical diagnostics through the clinical laboratories two supportive software solutions to healthcare providers including electronic health records laboratory information systems and medical billing services three decision support and interpretation of cancer and genomic diagnostics and four a hospital division created by the recent addition of a hospital in tennessee we believe that our strategy will produce a sustainable business and capture multiple revenue streams from medical providers clinical diagnostic side our principle line of business over the past few years has been clinical lab blood and urine testing services with a particular emphasis on the provision of toxicology testing to physicians clinic and rehabilitation facilities in the united states testing services to rehabilitation facilities represented approximately  of the companys revenues for the year ended  and approximately  of the companys revenues for the year ended  and  as we expand our customer base to include pain management and other healthcare providers we believe we will achieve a more diverse and stable revenue we believe that we are responding to the challenges faced by todays healthcare providers to adopt paper free and interoperable systems and to market demand for diagnostic solutions by expanding our suite of clinical services the drug and alcohol rehabilitation and pain management sectors provide an existing unsizable target market where the need for our services already exists and opportunity has been created by continued secular group and need for compliance in  we added genetic testing specifically pharmacogenomics testing to our array of services genetic testing represents the most rapidly expanding segment of the diagnostics market worldwide growing incidence of genetic disease presents new opportunities for genetic testing and a report issued by global industry analysts inc the global market for genetic testing is forecast to reach  billion by  increasing knowledge about the potential benefits of genetic testing is one of the prime reasons for the growth of this market advancements in the genetic testing space and aging population and corresponding rise in the number of chronic diseases and increasing incidence of cancer cases are other factors propelling growth in the genetic testing market primary revenue generating activity in this market revolves around dna profiling aimed at better understanding the predisposition for diseases and possible adverse reactions that may occur with drugs that are currently available andor under clinical development rising importance of early infection detection and prevention together with growing demand for dna tests in pharmacogenomics or cancer genetic testing are significant factors responsible for this anticipated growth to further capitalize on this opportunity we operate genomas inc a biomedical company that develops phyziotype systems for dnaguided management and prescription of drugs used to treat medical mental illness pain heart disease and diabetes for those of you who may not know a phyziotype systems consist of three components an array of inherited stable dna polymorphisms from various gens to establish a patients combined genotype bioclinical algorithms for predicting the patients drug response and a portal for doctors to select the best drug for the patient as disclosed in our financial statement during  the company experienced a dramatic decline in the volume of toxicology samples from the substance of this sector processed out of these labs and experienced continued difficulty in receiving reimbursement for these diagnostics in this sector as a result to reduce cost the company has in the first quarter of  moved all its processing of its clinical lab business to its flagship laboratory epic and cost reduction efforts are continuing in response to the operating losses encored in  we expect that success in the last quarter  and  to be at and attracting new customers will drive increased revenue in this division over business and coming months we continue to focus on securing new customers with diversified testing needs and have initiated a relationship and integration with a californiabased clinical research organization and believe that diagnostic service to clinical research organization creates a high growth opportunity for rennova our supportive software solutions as well as providing the it support and set out for lab customers we have developed and owned several propriety software solutions in this division we own a proprietary hipaa compliant software developed to eliminate the need for paper requisitions by providing an easy to use and efficient webbased systems that let customers securely place lab orders track samples and view test reports in real time historically we have used this software solely for our own labs but were now seeking opportunities and believe this software offers an opportunity for revenue generation from other providers we owned a windowsbased webenabled lab information management system it acts as hippacompliant data warehouse for lab results and includes reporting data acquisition label printing electronic sign off and numerous interface capabilities to a multitude of reference labs and practice system that scale from small physician operated labs to large clinical reference labs we own an ehr software for software for substance and this behavior health providers a dictationbased ambulatory ehr for physician practices and advanced transcription services solutions are webbased  secure and hippa compliant with remote access onsite training and intensive  technical support we owned a medical billing company that provides revenue cycle management services to third party customers currently focused on substance abuse facilities this billing company also functions as our inhouse billing company for our clinical labs decision support interpretation of cancer and genomic diagnostics are third division we own a solution to provide evidence interpretation and therapy guidance to enhance genomic testing and to provide actionable decision support for standardized evidencebased cancer care and superior clinical outcomes in precision oncology we also owned and operate genomus a biomedical company which as i mentioned earlier brings dnaguided medicine to clinical practice with products for personalized prescription of drugs used in the treatment of mental illness diabetes and cardiovascular disease our products eliminate trialanderror prescription with dnaguided medicine and enable physicians to treat with unprecedented precision avoiding significant drug side effects improving effectiveness and enhancing patient compliance core applications are drug treatments of mood and thought disorders and mental illness and of cardiometabolic risk in diabetes and and cardiovascular disease we are developing this section of our business into a focused division with a capable and specialized management team that can deliver an exciting platform to the marketplace we expect that we will shortly provide an update on progress for this division on a separate call that we will facilitate soon our hospital the company believes that the acquisition or development of a hospital division will create a stable and more predictable revenue for a needed services and believers that it can expand the sales of its current products and services to medical providers and doctors’ groups surrounding the hospital as previously reported we’ve recently acquired scott community hospital in tennessee which includes a  square foot hospital building  square foot professional building on approximately  acres this is a critical access real hospital with  beds a  emergency department operating rooms and laboratory that provides a range of diagnostic services we expect to hub of hospital open in part before the end of the second quarter of  and expect that the hospital will be fully operational by the end of the third quarter of  we are currently on target to achieve these dates but openly as subject to the receipt of the necessary licenses and regulatory approvals for which applications are ongoing this hospital had unaudited revenues annual revenues of approximately  million and a normalized ebitda of approximately  million for fiscal year  the last full year of the company’s  of the hospitals operation these revenues were attributable to the typical services of a real acute care hospital including emergency room visits outpatient procedures diagnostic ancillary test physical therapy and inpatient hospital stays based on this historical information we believe the hospital offers an established patient base and will be a source of stable unpredictable revenue for rennova financial condition with  behind us and significant financial support secured from one of our institutional investors in the first quarter of  we look forward to delivering value and opportunity to our shareholders with our current strategy we will continue to consider all options available to us to fund sell or spinoff one or more of the divisions described and subject to require concepts and regulations will explore the best opportunities to maximize shareholder value now i would like to turn the call over to marc gelberg to provide us a summary of the  financial report then to jack seeley head of sales and marketing for our diagnostics business to provide some commentary on these activities and before i wrap up you will hear from al lechner to provide a summary of our software division activities i will then take your questions marc marc gelberg thank you seamus looking at our full year  results our net revenues for  were approximately  million as compared with  million for  the decrease in net revenues was primarily due to a  million decline in clinical laboratory revenue resulting from an  decrease in insured test volumes revenues from our supportive software solution segment were just over  in  and that amount is essentially unchanged from  revenues from our decision and support and informatics operation segment were approximately  in  and that reflects a full year of operations of collabrx with whom we merged in the fourth quarter of  our lost from operations was  million compared with  million for  the narrowing of our operating loss was mainly due to asset impairment charges recognized in  in the amount of  million as compared with  million of asset impairment charges in  and a  million reduction in direct cost of revenue in  which will largely offset by the decline in clinical laboratory revenues as previously mentioned the companys transition is significant portion of its testing from external reference laboratories to internal processing which resulted in a  decrease in the direct cost for sample we reported a net after tax loss to common shareholders of  million or  per share for  compared with  million or  per share for fiscal  the fiscal  loss to common shareholders includes interest expense of  million noncash gains on the change in fair value of derivative instruments in the amount of  million and an income tax benefit in the amount of  million the fiscal  loss to common shareholders reflects interest expense of  million and income tax benefit of  million and dividends payable on the former medytox series b preferred stock in the amount of  million id like to point out that our financial statements for both  and  have been retrospectively adjusted for the one for  reverse stocks split that we effected in february of  we had cash on hand of approximately  as of december   during the first quarter of  we issued new convertible debentures with an aggregate principle amount of  million along with warrants of purchase approximately  million of our common stock for which we received net proceeds of  million now ill turn the call over to jack seeley jack jack seeley thanks marc and thank you for giving me the opportunity to discuss our performance and to share our optimism for this year despite several challenges including overall declines in testing volumes by our clients reduce census rates in our core client base in florida and declines in reimbursement for testing we came out of this year with several reasons for a positive outlook for the year we have solid gains in our client base in the substance abuse sector and finish with the strong fourth quarter for new business development in addition we stabilized our base away from a few very large clients to several smallto mediumsized customers which will minimize the effects of attrition and essentially eliminate that violent swings in volumes that play just last year  also presented us an opportunity to focus on our cost structure as a division although there were very difficult decisions to make we move forward with several lab consolidations in addition we reduced our staff considerably throughout the year exiting areas of the country that were not profitable for us to be in and consolidating roles for the effect on client retention would be minimal finally we eliminated unprofitable lines of business and clients it is our anticipation that the result of these decisions will be an increase profit margin for the coming year as we look ahead we will continue to leverage both our ehr and revenue cycle management products to increase our laboratory sales activity in addition we will continue our focus of diversifying our client base to further insulate us from the instability of the substance of this sector furthermore we will place additional focus on becoming a reference labs smaller laboratories a decision that has yielded several prospects for  finally the upcoming opening of the hospital will afford us to unique opportunity to provide laboratory services as an in network lab provider to the surrounding physicians we continue to see steady progress and securing new payer contracts as we prove our commitment to certain clients we’re looking forward to benefit from the recent increase in reimbursement by cms and hope that commercial payers follow suit we will continue our focus on strict compliance client education on medical necessity and suppressing over testing all of which will ensure that we will increase our reimbursements for the work we perform and lower our bad debt we’ve already begin to see the growth from our  decisions and finish the quarter close to our goals were confident that despite the evolution of and the scrutiny surrounding the substance of this sector our physician as weaken for compliance has distinguished us from our competition our sample counts have rebounded this year back to where we were a year ago and we will continue to focus on moderate continues growth with that i will turn the call over to al lechner al

stream within the substance abuse vertical with this summary i’ll turn the call back over to seamus seamus seamus lagan thank you everyone as jack has said we are currently enjoying an increasing volume of customers on tests ordered and we expect to achieve continued growth in our core diagnostic sectors throughout the year i have previously explained the four divisions we currently operated and we look forward to the hospital opening in tennessee in closing we have continued implement numerous efficiencies and readjust our infrastructure costs relative to production in our operations under nice seeing financial benefits from these actions we believe that a combination of these efficiencies and increased revenue will return our operations to be cash flow positive our hospital project has a need for continued investment on until it opens and becomes cash flow positive this was expected before the year end we are confident that we have adequate financial support to maintain this timeline and look forward to the hospital contributing revenue and value to our company before year end on a final note i have been asked by many shareholders about the financing mechanism used to reuse the cash needed to deliver on our ambitious business strategy we believe that a private placement as opposed to another public offering offer several advantages to your company the main source of recent funding as from one institutional investor we have been supportive of our business plan over the last couple of years and who wants to see us deliver on succeed with our business plan i would suggest that the mechanism of a convertible debenture that can be converted by the investor overtime is much more beneficial to our shareholders on an immediate deletion of ownership and gives us time to attain growth on an unexpected increase in the value of our business we are excited about the growth and opportunity in the markets in which we operate and believe that the quality of and need for rennovas product and services will secure increased market share for the rennova in the years to come we firmly believe that  will deliver results more in keeping with the expectations of our shareholders and investors we remain thankful for the support of all our shareholders and investors i hope you share managements expectations that the rennova health will put  has been a difficult year behind it and defer value for all our shareholders in  and beyond with that well open the call to your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of spencer layman ph a private investor please go ahead unidentified analyst yes your area of substance abuse there seems to be a huge epidemic of opioids and heroin such across the country and i know even the current administration is very concerned with it do you see a lot of government funding flowing into this in this coming year seamus lagan jack do you want to answer that from the sales perspective or would you like to me have a first rattle out of it jack seeley i can start and you can jump in and that’s not all and thank you for the question there has been a lot of talk from the government side in regards to the epidemic and how they want to fight it but there has really been nothing that we’ve seen to this point and so far is any type of strategy and how to tackle it which we’re all anticipating some type of ideas actually and into the current administration i know has really kind of tackle this right out of the gate but to this point we havent seen anything from them and so far is how theyre going to support this and their ideas of how to partner with various facilities and how to tackle the epidemic seamus i don’t know if you want to shed anymore light beyond that seamus lagan yes no i would make an additional comment your observation is absolutely correct there is an epidemic it is a massive sector it’s a sector that we do see first of all a large opportunity for growth we see a need for our services but the other side of that it’s a fragmented sector with regards to a unified solution in other words there is no unified approach you have a medical necessity and need on one side you have various treatment plans being applied and you have payers seeing significant cost to maintain these treatment plans and diagnostics and payers trying to  im not going to suggest trying to get overpaying claims but i will suggest that they have become much more focus on trying to understand what is medically necessary and what is medically beneficial to the patient and that’s created over the last couple of years a lot of confusion and weve been focused on this sector we have a good product in this sector we provide an excellent service in this sector but the facilities themselves are customers have undergone a lot of scrutiny as has the medical necessity have a lot of test that they use to treat their patients so we see a lot of benefit in the future from what we were trying to achieve we working jeff mentioned earlier we work with our customers to try and educate them to try and come up with a program or at least understand what their program is or their medical necessity is and we now have to provide that information to our payers to ensure that we get paid so its become a difficult sector with a lot of opportunity i think that last sentence that difficult sector with a lot of opportunity as a fair description of whats going on unidentified analyst thank you very much one way or the other the bottom line is as you see it is a great opportunity and i think i heard a few years ago where lot of your competitors were not doing it as well as they should and somehow had to drop out or there was a lot of some funny business and you were one of the remaining good guys and you should be getting a lot of that business is that scenario still exist seamus lagan that is a true statement we have  unfortunately we got the bills to prove it we spent a lot of money on compliance and understanding the rules regulations compliance and the sector and we have avoided many of the businesses practices by  that were adopted by other parties that definitely provided them a short term gain but a very short term business opportunity weve said very clearly that we believe were here for the long term five ten years plus were here for the longterm in this sector and therefore that focus is something that as jack has referred to you earlier we maintain and we believe that at the end of the day it is becoming recognized i appreciate your comment that we are one of the good guys we like to think that we are we think that that is being recognized and we think that it is one of the current advantages that we have in attracting new customers across the sector unidentified analyst and also of course we all hope that your contribution will help solve the problem in the long run so thank you for that seamus lagan what its all about it is trying to provide a better treatment plan a better outcome for the patients and that’s where the payers are going as well we have a lot of communication with payers even national payers at the minute we were in business long enough we have enough recognition not suggesting that we have all the contracts that we would like to have but were certainly talking to the national payers and understanding their needs to try and demonstrate better outcomes going forward for the patient operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of michael peters ph a private investor please go ahead unidentified analyst thank you for bringing some clarity for us as individual investors as we can in the following the stock for some time i felt personally i have a question about whether or not we have or has rennova thought about the genetic testing opportunities in the fertility treatment platform if you obviously very familiar with the ivf and the genetic testing that’s done maybe perhaps you guys are but and that space i am familiar with the market for the need for genetic testing from with respect to the embryos and the eggs and the fertility aspect and its an epidemic unfortunately from personal experience looking within the medical field has rennova thought about finding different areas i know you can see you find in different areas to find our revenue streams which is great but broadening the scope a little bit to to tap into things that perhaps you didn’t initially plan on venturing into i think it might be also beneficial to do that since you have the platform the software and perhaps it’s various sort of synergy there any thoughts seamus lagan michael your last sentence is a very accurate statement we have the platform and we have the expertise that the knowledge to service that sector that is a sector that we have done some diligence on we currently do not provide diagnostics in the sector so don’t let me  let me be very clear about the statement i make but one of the  if you’re familiar with the sector one of the advantages that we see with the ivf sector for consideration it’s almost all direct pay it’s almost always paid directly by the individuals as opposed to insurance companies deciding whether it should be paid or not and i have alluded to the sector of our business undergoing a little upgrade and restructure if you like and i have alluded to a call at some stage in the near future updating everybody of developments in this sector and we have built a fairly extensive product offering and we  the next stage is to secure those additional orders that we can’t service and we believe we will get there so just want to be clear that we are not currently servicing that sector but that is one of the definitely an exciting sector that we are currently focused on looking at so does that answer your question michael unidentified analyst yes it does and the reason i brought it up as obviously the investor in the company who envision staying on longterm i don’t i would like to find some value in companies that i feel that may hit strategically this your stock prices are little bit depressed right now and hopefully that will change but i brought it up because it is a revenue stream that’s pretty much direct pay like you said and the  and you won’t have to worry about insurance companies and all that nonsense to get us a deal with  and it’s a huge unfortunately you would like it would be easier for some people to be able to have to conceive but it’s a very profitable business that you can probably tap into given your strategic position and not have to worry about getting paid for your services which seems to have been a big problem in  so seamus lagan yes michael you’re absolutely right and as you know from my comment we have done a little diligence on it the profile of the customer is very different from a customer and the substance abuse sector it’s usually  the profile is usually more and keeping with an individual who has waited a little before deciding with family or whatever and they usually are willing to and will and can pay for the past so yes the sector we’re looking out it’s a sector that provides that there is opportunity and we look forward to seeing how we move forward over the next period of time unidentified analyst well thank you i appreciate it and we will look forward to the upcoming quarters and thank you again for your time and your response operator and thank you there are no further questions at this time please proceed with your presentation or any closing remarks seamus lagan i just like to finish by thanking everybody who has participated i will say that we do try to keep our shareholders informed i know sometimes people think that our  we should have more frequent news announcements and i think that is important to stress that we are bound by all the sec and nasdaq regulations and we try to keep to sec filings and very factual events as opposed to an ongoing stream of news that may not have a lot of meaning behind it so i appreciate everybodys patience with that we do try to keep people informed on our website and we will provide any additional presentations that we make or participate and including any information of the future conference calls we will make that information all available on our website so again just thank you all for participating and thank you all for your support operator ladies and gentlemen that concludes your conference call for today we thank you for
