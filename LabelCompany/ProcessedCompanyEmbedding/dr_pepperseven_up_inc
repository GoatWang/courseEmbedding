purpose is to maximize shareholder value by creating uniquely refreshing beverage experiences and a business environment that marries our talents and aspirations with our shareholders objective to achieve superior returns and our customers desires for high quality products and service history of dr pepperseven up inc dr pepperseven up inc dpsu is the number three soft drink maker in the world trailing only the two industry giants cocacola company and pepsico inc it is also the us leader in noncola soft drinks with its two flagship brands holding top ten positions among all soft drinksdr pepper at number six and  up at number nine wholly owned by uk confectionery and drink maker cadbury schweppes plc since  dpsu also produces a number of other drink brands including welchs ibc root beer and cream soda canada dry schweppes a  w crush sunkist squirt motts hires sundrop vernors and country time early development of dr pepper dr pepper the elder brand of the two flagship brands was invented in waco texas at morrisons old corner drug store in  a young pharmacist who worked for morrisons charles c alderton experimented on his own soft drink he mixed phosphorescent water fruit juice sugar and other ingredients to produce a new soft drink unlike any tasted before with morrisons approval alderton offered the drink to the stores customers one of these jokingly called the concoction dr peppers drinkfor dr charles pepper the disapproving father of a woman morrison had been courting suggesting that pepper might be flattered the name and the soft drink with its tart yet sweet flavor became popular locally and in  morrison offered beverage chemist robert s lazenby the opportunity to participate in the marketing and development of this new product after sampling dr peppers drink lazenby agreed to go into partnership with morrison to produce the beverage at his circle a ginger ale company also in waco alderton the drinks inventor dissociated himself from dr pepper opting instead to turn his talents to the pharmaceutical trade the new product dr peppers phosferrates was available only in soda fountains until  when the manufacturers began bottling the beverage with lazenby handling the business end dr pepper became a top seller in and around texas expansion was inevitable and lazenby sought a marketing opportunity to introduce dr pepper to the world the ideal forum was the  worlds fair held in st louis lazenby and his soninlaw jb ohara demonstrated their product there providing samples of dr pepper to some of the approximately  million worlds fair visitors incidentally the  exhibition also showcased other innovations including the icecream cone and buns for hot dogs and hamburgers dr peppers success encouraged lazenby and morrison who founded the artesian manufacturing and bottling company which would eventually be renamed the dr pepper company by  headquarters were moved from waco to dallas texas early development of  up around  while dr pepper was growing in favor cl grigg an advertising veteran of  years had formed the howdy company in st louis missouri the company was named for the howdy orangeflavored soft drink grigg had developed but the ceo had other ideasspecifically to invent a new flavor of beverage for two years grigg tested different combinations of lemon and other flavors by the mids he had settled on a distinctive lemonlime formula and in  the howdy company introduced the soda to the general public grigg and company were confident of their inventions appeal as an early sales bulletin noted consumers are tired of the insipid flavors and the aftertaste of the heavy synthetic flavors is more objectionable  so in our beverage we have provided seven natural flavors so blended and in such proportions that when bottled it produces a big natural flavor with a real taste that makes people remember it the only thing that might have stood in the way of the drinks early success was its name biblabel lithiated lemonlime soda griggs derived the new and much simpler name  up from the beverages seven natural flavors the new name first appeared on the bottle later in  the beverage sold well and the new name made it easy for consumers to remember in  the howdy company became the sevenup company and by the s its product became the worlds third largest selling soft drink marketing developments ss although what distinguished both drinks from the rest of the market was unique flavor neither beverage was marketed simply as a refreshment indeed both dr pepper whose name still retained the period at this time and  up were promoted as health drinks in their first decades in the s dr peppers famous slogan drink a bite to eat at     capitalized on the idea that one typically experienced an energy slump during those hours a serving of dr pepper would presumably provide the energy boost needed to make it through the day at the same time  up boasted in ads that it energizes  sets you up dispels brain cobwebs and muscular fatigue the fortunes of both companies grew during world war ii with dr pepper able to go public in  while the postwar period saw the baby boom which produced an unprecedented number of soft drink consumers in their marketing efforts both beverage companies sought to appeal to this lucrative market dr pepper for instance became a regular sponsor of the hit teen show american bandstand while  up became noted for its uncola campaign of the late s which capitalized on the individualistic tendencies of young people by distancing  up from the cola market in the s dr pepper was marketed through the longrunning be a pepper campaign later advertising efforts avoided the socalled cola wars of the s focusing instead on what made dr pepper and  up different dr pepper ads declared the soft drink was just what the dr ordered while diet dr pepper was the taste youve been looking for  up introduced an animated character spot derived from the its longused logo a large  with a red spot in the middle that revitalized the uncola theme that worked so well in the s both companies also spent years testing and introducing new products while refining existing ones both dr pepper and  up brought out diet versions by the early s in  dr pepper purchased the rights to welchs soft drinks  ownership changes then dr pepperseven up dr pepper was traded on the new york stock exchange until  when it was taken private in a  million leveraged buyout by forstmann little  co some of the companys assets were stripped to pay down debt overhead was cut and a new promotional campaign was launched meantime sevenup was a privately owned family business that did not avail itself of public trading until  in  cigarette maker philip morris bought sevenup which soon went into a profit slide by  philip morris was set to sell the struggling sevenup company to pepsico while cocacola was seeking to buy dr pepper the federal trade commission however blocked both proposed acquisitions for antitrust reasons although philip morris was allowed to sell sevenups international operations to pepsico dallasbased investment bank hicks  haas then entered the picture purchasing dr pepper in another leveraged buyout for  million in august  participating in the buyout was britains cadbury schweppes which gained a minority stake in dr pepper later in  hicks  haas struck again purchasing the us operations of sevenup for  million two years later hicks  haas merged dr pepper and sevenup forming the dr pepperseven up companies inc on may   the combined market strength of the two companies created a stronger contender in the soft drink market against coke and pepsi the new company began with a brand portfolio that included dr pepper and  up both in regular and diet versions caffeinefree dr pepper and diet dr pepper cherry  up introduced in  welchs and ibc root beer and cream soda in  dr pepperseven up entered the sport drink field with nautilus thirst

million which was used to redeem the companys preferred stock and to retire debt during the early s dpsu enjoyed vigorous growth with sales increasing from  million to  million from  to  alone these gains came despite the continuing struggles of the  up brand which by this time had been surpassed by rival brand sprite owned by cocacola dr peppers popularity however was on the increase it was in fact the fastestgrowing us carbonated beverage garnering a compound average growth of  percent a year from  through  overall dpsus share of the domestic soft drink market increased from  percent in  to  percent in  as of mid cadbury schweppes held a  percent stake in dr pepperseven up the holding stemming from its minority interest in dr pepper prudential insurance co held a  percent stake in dpsu which it sold to cadbury in august  for  million raising cadburys stake in dpsu to  percent under the leadership of john albers dpsu quickly adopted a poison pill measure which discouraged cadbury from making any immediate moves to further raise its stake or initiate a complete takeover albers also refused to grant its suitor a seat on the board as it had requested meantime cadbury in october  further increased its presence in the us market through the acquisition of a  w brands inc thereby gaining us ownership or rights to the flagship a  w root beer brand the citrusflavored squirt vernors ginger ale and country time lemonades cadbury already controlled the schweppes canada dry crush motts and sunkist brands subsidiary of cadbury schweppes starting in  the addition of a  w brands increased cadburys share of the us soft drink market to  percent but the uk company aimed to become the leading producer of noncola soft drinks in the world the emphasis on the noncola sector made particular sense in the us market where noncola sales were increasing at a ten percent per year clip while cola sales were merely edging ahead at four percent a year the quickest path to achieving this goal was the acquisition of dpsu particularly since cadbury believed the dr pepper brand had untapped potential outside the united states as it held a mere one percent of the world market in march  then cadbury schweppes acquired the  percent of dr pepperseven up stock it did not already own for  per share or  billion leading the newly named dr peppercadbury of north america inc

campaigns pricing gains innovation and productivity improvements are expected to boost sales we are also encouraged by the companys rapid continuous improvement program through which it has been able to reduce inventory and storage costs and improve cash flows the company earlier notified that marketing expenses excluding bai brands is expected to increase by about  million in the second quarter

responsible for the squirt brand needs to draft the companys new advertising and promotion plan before proceeding she needs to first redevelop the companys positioning and identify what target markets to pursue she considered these  factors to be the most important in developing the advertising  promotion plan competitor activity by cocacola  pepsicola implications of a growing hispanic community squirts decreased sales volume dr pepperseven up is the largest division of cadbury schweppes plcworld’s third largest soft drink company squirt is dpsus ninth largest brand after dr pepper seven up canada dry aw and otherssquirt is the best selling brand in the grapefruit carbonated soda categoryit also competes in the citrus carbonated soft drink category with mountain dew and cocacola citrus brands overview of dpsu key industry facts the whole carbonated soft drink industry csd sales figure in  was  billion however in recent years sales growth has slowedthe production and distribution of csds is simplified as follows the concentrate producer such as squirt manufacture the basic flavor in this case grapefruit the bottler adds a sweetener sugar or artificial sugar to carbonated water and package the mixture in bottles and cans the bottlers are responsible for distributing the units to retailers and are also responsible for some local marketing activities the major retail channels for csds are supermarkets convenience stores vending machines fountain services mass merchandisers and small retail outlets restaurants buy a syrup and they add to it carbonated water so they do the bottling processflavored soft drinks have grown in popularity introduction to drpepperseven up inc  squirt situational analysis la alone accounted for  of case sales volume ca accounted for  of case sales volumes ny is the largest market without a squirt bottler  of hispanics live in western and southern us    of mexicans  of mexicans  million hispanics in ca  million hispanics in tx san antonio el paso san diego squirts current marketing tactics squirts positioning squirts product line squirts distribution squirts advertising  promotion our recommendation cocacola launched fresca and citra fresca is targeted at adults while citra at the young generation squirt outsells both brands combinedhowever cocacolas advertising  promotion budget is a future indicator of worry because it is higher than pepsi colas  million and  million respectivelypepsi mountain dew should be given the most attention it is the leading brand in the citrus csd category and its growth rate surpasses all competitors by farmountain dew is the th top soft drink brand in the us strengths weaknesses opportunities threats swot analysis •squirt is the bestselling carbonated grapefruit soft drink brand in the us•dpsu has a  market share of  billion   billion•squirt available in  of bottler markets•fcb research showed that squirt was the most thirst quenching brand •flavored soft drinks growing in popularity•hispanic communities who favor noncola flavors are fastest growing population segment•squirt is the th largest carbonated soft drink brand in mexico and  of hispanics in the us are mexican •soft drink consumption in general has slowed•cocacola taking advantage of changing soft drink trends tab  manzana mía•pepsi’s mountain dew controls about  of the citrus flavored csd market and spends  million in advertising •media advertising for squirt less than competitors•consumer research showed that consumers considered squirt advertising to be too juvenile •perceptual map of citrus flavored csds showed squirt neither young nor notsoyoung• of consumers of squirt are caucasian five forces analysis buyer bargaining power  high consumers control the bargaining power when it comes to the soft drink industry because soft drinks are not a necessity for every day life however they don’t purchase large quantities and they favor such drinks to be placed in locations that are convenient to them this means that squirt can be priced at a higher premium due to it being placed in convenient locations supplier bargaining power  low soft drink manufacturers has an advantage over its suppliers because they only have to produce the flavored syrup the rest of the processes are delegated to distributors as a result squirt can more easily switch from one supplier to another competitive rivalry  high squirt faces a number of competitors that includes cocacola’s grapefruit soft drink brands which are fresca and citra it also competes with mello yello surge pepsi cola’s mountain dew and sundrop these competitors are trying to obtain squirts market share by focusing more on their advertising threat of substitutes  high cocacola introduced its international brand fanta with with different flavors to southern california other flavors are a dangerous substitutesquirt is free of caffeine consumers might substitute noncaffeinated beverages with caffeinated ones such as mountain dew threat of new entrants  low  the market in which squirt is in is  controlled by dr pepperseven up inc pepsicola company and the cocacola company these companies also manage the top  soft drink brands in the us this indicates that trying to gain a large market share is not feasible but trying to enter the market is not impossible as well history in  the squirt beverage was created by herb bishop from arizona who recreated a non carbonated drink called citrus club he used less sugar and fruit to create the carbonated version of it  the international expansion of squirt was in the s and it happened that the first international markets were central  south america a foreshadowing perhaps squirt joined aw which was eventually bought over by cadbury schweppes    after cadbury schweppes bought dpsu it assigned to it the responsibility of the squirt brand in  in the united states even though mountain dew poses a threat with its enormous control of the citrus flavored csd carbonated soft drink market share the perceptual map plots mountain dew only hallway through the thirstquenching  refreshing paradigm this means that if squirt positions itself as young and hip it has an upper hand in not only reaching mountain dew’s position but reaching its position armed with the additional attribute of being thirstquenching how squirt can overcome these threats using its strengths how squirt can overcome its weaknesses to capitalize on opportunities squirt’s weakness of failing to appeal to the young can be countered by a new double barreled campaign that is aimed at young hispanics hispanics have a median age of  and  of them are below the age of  so by targeting the hispanic market squirt automatically has to simultaneously modify and redevelop its brand image to also appeal to the younger market segment the effects of this targeting might even cause a spillover on the nonhispanic youth market   million cases out of a total of   million cases out of a total of   million cases out of a total of   million cases out of a total of   million cases out of a total of  hispanic population size grew by  from  to   million of hispanics in the us are mexicanhispanics represent  of total us population of hispanics live in the western and southern united statesmore than  of hispanics live in california and texasfrom the top  hispanic cities  cities are in the west and south squirt has the regular squirt grapefruit flavored soft drink and a diet version of thatsquirt also introduced a berry flavored extension called ruby red in both regular and diet versions there are  bottlers in the us  of them bottle and sell squirt beveragesthese bottlers have access to  of the us bottler market that represents  of the total soft drink volume which is  billionthe los angeles bottler market alone represented  of squirt salesthere are  squirt in the western us and accounted for half of squirts salescalifornia alone represented  of squirt sales squirts media advertising include inserts in newspapers spot  cable television and radiopromotions are used with retail channels consumers trade channels and cooperative ads with bottlershighest brand awareness in the grapefruit category due to advertisingsquirt spends more on promotions than on media advertisingtotal advertising and promotion expenditure was  of sales which is  initially squirt was positioned as a cool experiential and incredibly exciting this was considered too intense and was toned downthe current positioning became related to everyday on the go experiences that put emphasis individualistic and sociable young adults target market narrowed down to  year oldsthe original thirst quenching attribute was not changed in the new positioning schemeresearch however showed that squirts messages were too juvenile for both young and older consumers their sales volume grew from  million in  to  cases in  mountain dew also spent  million in  adopt fcbs recommendation a mix of east  west maintain the current strategy what can squirt do according to foote cone  belding fcb the  age group is the heaviest consumer of soft drinksthe thirst quenching attribute is to be reemphasized but advertising would focus solely on  year olds to position the brand as an individualistic exciting and spontaneousfcb believes that such positioning is relevant to the csd industry emphasizes instant gratification freedom that young adults like and it matches squirts product feelthe positive side of their recommendation is that currently the  age group is the least segment that consumes squirttheir emphasis on a multicultural young segment is of great significance the mexican connection mexico is the nd largest csd market in the world and squirt is th largest csd brand in mexicothe grapefruit csd category is the second largest in mexico after the cola category and within that category squirt comes secondmore than half of americas hispanics are mexican and  of californias hispanics are mexican which also happens to be squirts largest marketfcbs recommendation as a result is aligned with geographic opportunities and conditions  of hispanics are mexican fcbs recommendation is very relevant to market demographic and cultural conditionsit capitalizes on the key and opportunistic growth of the hispanic community as well as the association that exists between the younger generation and the consumption of soft drinksone major aspect that fcb did not take into account was the eastern united states even though  of hispanics live in the west  south new york is the most populous hispanic city in the us with  million hispanics chicago in the midwest is the rd most populous hispanic city with  hispanics squirt has the least access to the new york market and new york has the largest hispanic population this is a gold mine for squirt most of squirts consumers are caucasian so why should they risk losing this large customer base by modifying their ad and promotion campaign to suit hispanic and african american tastes squirt is doing better than cocacolas citra consumers think that it does not appeal to them and that squirt effectively communicated to them the intended thirst quenching messagesales only went down from  million cases to  million cases which is not a large decrease compared to cocacolas sales decrease changing the current marketing strategy might risk squirts advantage over citra and in terms of sales and brand awareness squirt has good footing in the citrus and grapefruit category squirt should target the multicultural  age group in western southern and eastern united states squirt should now spend more on media advertising than on promotions because in order to effectively target the hispanic community a message must be clearly communicated of hispanics prefer ads in spanish which means that squirt should create spanish language ads but at the same time create english language ads that appeal to hispanic culture because  of them prefer english adsthe nature of brands should reflect hispanic peoples preference for authenticity and clarity in messages and adshispanics like shopping close to home squirt can easily capitalize because of the extensive distribution network it has in the west  bottlers in cathis also means that contracts need to be made with bottlers in the new york area in order to satisfy their preference for proximityin addition to creating a campaign to satisfy hispanic preferences the  age group must also be effectively targetedsquirt must now position itself not only as a thirst quenching brand which young people like but also as young hip and individualistic this dual targeting and positioning scheme will definitely require a higher advertising budget but the truth is squirts sales volume does not reflect the potential that both the hispanic and  segments have thank youfull transcriptmore presentations by kareem hammour untitled preziuntitled prezispain  amsterdam
