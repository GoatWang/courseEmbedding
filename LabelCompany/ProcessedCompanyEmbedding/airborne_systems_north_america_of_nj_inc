oxygen mask builds on the reliability and strong features of its predecessor the airborne systems’ phaos oxygen mask the current reference for the parachutist oxygen masks used by military units worldwide the solr™ oxygen mask is compatible with the new solr™ and legacy phaos bailout bottles it is also compatible with the phantom bailout bottle the solr™ oxygen mask provides the same performance and time proven reliability as the phaos oxygen mask with the added benefit of new features developed based on input received from experiences collected over the years from the military free fall community the solr™ oxygen mask features a new nondilution oxygen demand regulator which delivers  oxygen during inhalation both during prebreathing and during the actual jump and descent under canopy  this ensures that the jumper is never breathing a mix of gas and mitigates the risk of hypoxia drastically increasing the safety of operation  this breakthrough innovation is made possible thanks to the very high service pressure of airborne systems’ latest bailout bottles allowing them to contain significantly more oxygen than traditional bailout bottles key features

products and services to its customers worldwide airborne’s products are more than just parachutes they design manufacture and support a diverse range of products with safety and quality requirements in mind at every step airborne systems introduced lean methodologies into their growing operations to continue to deliver their quality products on time and in an efficient and cost competitive manner airborne systems turned to new jersey manufacturing extension program inc njmep to help them accomplish this objective njmep worked closely with the management of airborne systems to develop a training program for implementing lean  through value stream mapping vsm a lean technique that captures a picture of the work process analyzes its problems and then creates a new work process specific operations were streamlined the project took place over a day period and produced significant savings njmep also helped facilitate a cellular flow manufacturing project a kaizen blitz kaizen events are designed to improve standardized activities and processes they are similar to vsm in that they are designed to eliminate waste saving time  money in the manufacturing process the blitz used a multifunctional team of  people from within the organization  the team learned the cellularflow manufacturing concepts and applied them to a specified process through a fivestep approach the team would  define the current process using of flowcharting  map the process  measure the process performance and  observe the process and  redesign the process for substantial improvements the objective of the process is to provide the organization with  a layout of the proposed process  projected performance measures for the new process  detailed workstation designs  an implementation plan and actions list airborne systems was surveyed as to the impact the cellular flow manufacturing project had on the company  airborne’s vice president and general manager of new jersey operations david seifert attributed the following to the project “we increased manufacturing efficiency and capacity which enabled us to grow the business”   more than  increased sales due to increased manufacturing capacity and efficiency gains  new hires due to growth and new business associated with increased capacity and reduced costs more than  in cost savings due to gains in manufacturing efficiency in addition the company was also able to reduce lead times minimize wip improve productivity the next airborne systems and njmep project is geared to a new product launch  when njmep field agent karen evanko conducted a quickview assessment prior to beginning this next project airborne systems when  compared with companies within its sic code ranked in the top quarter percentile in all categories in the  section survey dave seifert vice president and general manager airborne systems new jersey operations explained “we continue to work with njmep as a great provider of lean resources to provide
