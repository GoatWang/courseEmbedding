preexploration stage company and have a weak competitive position in the industry we compete with junior and senior mineral exploration companies independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the world together with the equipment labor and materials required to operate on those properties competition for the acquisition of mineral exploration interests is intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information or expertise available to other bidders many of the mineral exploration companies with which we compete for financing and for the acquisition of mineral exploration properties have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us accordingly these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring mineral exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their mineral exploration properties this advantage could enable our competitors to acquire mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and development such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration interests or explore and develop our current or future mineral exploration properties we also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in such companies the presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our acquisition or exploration programs if investors perceive that investments in our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their mineral exploration properties or the price of the investment opportunity in addition we compete with both junior and senior mineral exploration companies for available resources including but not limited to professional geologists land specialists engineers camp staff helicopters float planes mineral exploration supplies and drill rigs general competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation andor regulation introduced from time to time by the governments of the republic of the philippines the united states and other countries as well as factors beyond our control including international political conditions overall levels of supply and demand for mineral exploration in the face of competition we may not be successful in acquiring exploring or developing profitable gold or mineral properties or interests and we cannot give any assurance that suitable gold or mineral properties or interests will be available for our acquisition exploration or development despite this we hope to compete successfully in the gold or mineral industry by  keeping our costs low  relying on the strength of our management’s contacts and  using our size and experience to our advantage by adapting quickly to changing market conditions or responding swiftly to potential opportunities company description we are a startup preexploration mining company with one mineral claim ie the lebak gold claim in the republic of the philippines we rely upon the sale of our securities to fund our start up as we have not generated any revenue we have a going concern uncertainty as of the date of our most recent financial statements our goal is to generate revenues through the sale of gold found and extracted from this claim we have a specific business plan to complete exploration work on this claim and have no reason to alter this plan within the next twelve months our company has no subsidiaries affiliates or joint venture partners we do not intend to enter into a merger or acquisition have not been involved in any large purchases other than that of the lebak gold claim and have not been involved in any reclassification bankruptcy or receivership since our inception cataca resources inc was established as a private company by mr barrios and mr ramos to acquire and develop gold properties while world gold prices are strong we raised  in initial capital in order to identify and purchase a promising mineral property claim pursuant to regulation s of the securities act of  our company sold  shares of its common stock in a private placement for the  our company acquired the lebak gold claim from benefacio minerals llc an unrelated company on december   for the sum of  this is our only mineral claim it was assigned by benefacio minerals llc to us upon our formation on december   in december  we engaged a mining consultant john jeffrey martinez to develop a preliminary scoping study for the development of the lebak gold claim any previous exploration work was reviewed and recommendations for an exploration program were made assuming we can raise the necessary capital we intend to carry out the exploration program proposed on the lebak gold claim there is the distinct possibility that we will not only fail to raise the capital but fail to find a commercially viable ore body there is no guarantee that gold of significant value will be found we currently do not have any ore body products or revenues  we were incorporated on december   under the laws of the state of nevada our principal executive offices are located at  ayala avenue makati city philippines  our telephone number is   full

popular trading indicators are suggesting in terms of going long or short the opinions takes up to  years worth of historical data and runs these prices through thirteen different technical indicators after each calculation the program assigns a buy sell or hold value for each study depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study for example if the price is above the moving average of the stock then this is generally considered an upward trend or a buy note a security needs to have at least  active trading days in order to generate an opinion reading calculations the short medium and long term indicators are grouped together and calculated separately for their groups the overall indicator is a composite of all  studies listed on the page a buy is assigned  point a sell is assigned  point a hold is assigned  points the indicator value is determined by adding up the totals for the different groups and dividing this sum by the number of studies in the group the indicator is expressed in terms of a percentage if the total is greater than zero then this is a buy if the total is zero then this is a hold if the total is less than zero then this is a sell to keep the results in a more logical format we factor the overall opinion by  to keep the end result in multiples of  percentage points with the exception of a  buy or sell this is why the opinion indicators will be displayed as      and  for example rather the exact percentage value opinions are updated every ten minutes throughout the day using delayed data from the exchangessupport
