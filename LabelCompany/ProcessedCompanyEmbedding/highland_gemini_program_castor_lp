nasa gemini missions this website is funded by your donations about earthly issues contact site map president trump  nasa gemini missions the national aeronautics and space administration announced december   a plan to extend the existing manned space flight program by development of a twoman spacecraft the program was officially designated gemini on january   it was named after the third constellation of the zodiac featuring the twin stars castor and pollux the program was operationally completed with the gemini xii flight the gemini program was managed by the manned spacecraft center houston texas under direction of the office of manned space flight nasa headquarters washington dc dr george e mueller associate administrator of nasa for manned space flight served as acting director of the gemini program william c schneider deputy director of manned space flight for mission operations served as mission director on all gemini flights beginning with gemini v the manned spacecraft center gemini effort was headed by dr robert r gilruth director of the center and charles w matthews gemini program manager  program objectives  the gemini program was conceived after it became evident to nasa officials that an intermediate step was required between project mercury and the apollo program the major objectives assigned to gemini were to subject two men and supporting equipment to long duration flights  a requirement for projected later trips to the moon or deeper space to effect rendezvous and docking with other orbiting vehicles and to maneuver the docked vehicles in space using the propulsion system of the target vehicle for such maneuvers to perfect methods of reentry and landing the spacecraft at a preselected landlanding point to gain additional information concerning the effects of weightlessness on crew members and to record the physiological reactions of crew members during long duration flights a brief summary of the gemini flight results reveals how successful the gemini program was all of the major objectives were met as well as many other objectives assigned to each mission with the exception of land landing which was canceled from the gemini program in  however the precision control necessary to achieve the land landing objective was demonstrated gemini goals the second us manned space program was announced in january  its twoman crew gave it its name gemini for the third constellation of the zodiac and its twin stars castor and pollux gemini involved  flights including two unmanned flight tests of the equipment like mercurys its major objectives were clearcut to subject man and equipment to space flight up to two weeks in duration to rendezvous and dock with orbiting vehicles and to maneuver the docked combination by using the target vehicles propulsion system to perfect methods of entering the atmosphere and landing at a preselected point on land its goals were also met with the exception of a land landing which was cancelled in    the spacecraft  the spacecraft was an enlargement of the familiar mercury capsulem  ft long m  ft in diameter and about  kilograms  pounds in weight engineering changes simplified maintenance and made it more maneuverable for the pilots the titan ii rocket more powerful than the redstone placed the larger spacecraft into orbit sometimes referred to as geminititan for the craft and its launch vehicle each flight was designated by a roman numeral only the first capsule was nicknamed command pilot virgil grissom called it the molly brown in reference to his mercury spacecraft
