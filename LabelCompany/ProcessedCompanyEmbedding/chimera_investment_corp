chimera investment cim achilles research longshort equity special situationssummarychimera investments shares have risen  percent in the last yearthe highyield sector is overvalued hasnt seen a correction in a yearchimera investments shares are priced at a  percent premium to book value are overbought tooi have sold most highyield stocks in  rewardtorisk ratio is no longer attractivechimera investment corps nysecim shares have had an amazing run in the last year while i have sold out of chimera investment due to my growing anxiety over the mortgage reits unsustainable valuation income investors dont seem to get enough of the company these days with highyield being a favorite of income investors again chimera investments shares have potential to run higher over the short haul though however the rewardtorisk ratio is no longer compelling for new investors highyield income vehicles have produced outstanding returns for investors over the last twelve months and chimera investment is only one example other highyield income vehicles including business development companies prospect capital corp nasdaqpsec main street capital corp nysemain or hercules capital inc nasdaqhtgc have seen a dramatic increase in their market valuation over the last year on the back of growing investor optimism in case of chimera investment income investors saw the companys share price climb  percent in the last year source stockchartscom on top of that significant price gain income investors got a share quarterly dividend in the first three quarters of  as well as a special dividend of share at the end of the st quarter in other words an investment in chimera investment was a very lucrative one however the risks in the highyield sector are growing by the day that is not to say that a correction is imminent but downside risks have clearly increased for most income vehicles in the mortgage reit and business development company sectors though chimera investment corp maintains good dividend coverage which prompted the mortgage reit to bump its th quarter dividend by share to share there are reasons to be fearful chimera investments shares have risen from  in february  when nobody wanted them to  today when everyone wants them as a result chimera investments shares today are priced at a  percent premium to book value which is a steep price to pay and they are significantly overbought too cim price to book value data by ycharts the truth is that chimera investments valuation  and valuations of highyield income vehicles in general  are very stretched today and that there is a good chance that shares have already run ahead of the fundamentals with many highyielders being priced for perfection and selling for inflated niiffobook value multiples investors may want to think about raising their cash levels in order to take advantage of an inevitable dip in highyield valuations your takeaway i have sold most of my highyield income holdings in  including prospect capital main street capital and chimera investment because the air is getting thinner the rate of price appreciation we have seen in the last year is not sustainable and a correction will come probably sooner rather than later while chimera investment and other highyield income vehicles could run higher in the next couple of months on the back of even stronger investor optimism investors must understand that they pay a very high price for highyield equity investments today the rewardtorisk ratio in the highyield sector is no longer appealing be fearful when others are greedy
