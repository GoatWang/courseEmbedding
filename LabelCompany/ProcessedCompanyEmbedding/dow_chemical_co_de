dow survived by also cutting its prices and although losing about  in income began to diversify its product line in  german bromide producers began dumping bromides at low cost in the us in an effort to prevent dow from expanding its sales of bromides in europe instead of competing directly for market share with the german producers dow bought the cheap germanmade bromides and shipped them back to

chemicals elemental chlorine phenol and other dyestuffs and magnesium metal during world war i dow chemical supplied many war materials the united states had previously imported from germany dow produced magnesium for incendiary flares monochlorobenzene and phenol for explosives and bromine for medicines and tear gas by   percent of dow chemical production was geared towards the war effort at this time dow created the diamond logo that is still used by the company after the war dow continued research in magnesium and developed refined automobile pistons that produced more speed and better fuel efficiency the dowmetal pistons were used heavily in racing vehicles and the  winner of the indianapolis  used the dowmetal pistons in his vehicle in the s dow began producing plastic resins which would grow to become one of the corporations major businesses its first plastic products were ethylcellulose made in  and polystyrene made in  diversification and expansionedit from  to  dow

available through the safety and chemical engineering education program an affiliate of american institute of chemical engineers aiche and the campbell institute an organization focusing on environment health and safety practices the dow lab safety academy is one component of dow’s larger laboratory safety initiative launched in early  following a report from the us chemical safety board that highlighted the potential hazards associated with conducting research at chemical laboratories in academic institutions seeking to share industry best practices with academia dow partnered with several us research universities to improve safety awareness and practices in the departments of chemistry chemical engineering engineering and materials through the pilot programs with uc santa

andrew n liveris called  the companys best year ever with operating profits of  billion a jump of  percent compared with the previous year net income rose more than  percent to  billion on sales of  billion  looks as if it could be even better with firstquarter net earnings of  billion all this is occurring in the context of adverse operating conditions caused by high energy and raw material costs and the effects of two damaging hurricanes liveris supports the vertically integrated approach used at dow which produces everything from basic chemical feedstocks to high value products such as pesticides and reverse osmosis membranes these valueadding product chains along with dows wide product range help the company to weather the storms of the global economy despite this high energy and feedstock costs may begin to take their toll particularly if global demand begins to fall just as supply is rising like many chemical companies dow is facing pressures of regulation in the us and europe particularly as the eu introduces its new reach policy litigation costs in the us taken over by dow as a result of its  takeover of union carbide also remain a concern for these reasons dow is

videos and resources that demonstrate best practices in laboratory safety the goal of the website is to improve awareness of safety practices in academic research laboratories and to help the future chemical workforce develop a safety mindset as such the dow lab safety academy is primarily geared toward university students however dow has made the content open to all including those already employed in the chemical industry the dow lab safety academy is also available through the safety and chemical engineering education program an affiliate of american institute of chemical engineers aiche and the campbell institute an organization focusing on environment health and safety practices the dow lab safety academy is one component of dow’s larger laboratory safety initiative launched in early  following a report from the us chemical safety board that highlighted the potential hazards associated with conducting research at chemical laboratories in academic institutions seeking to share industry best practices with academia dow partnered with several us research universities to improve safety awareness and practices in the departments of chemistry chemical engineering engineering and materials through the pilot programs with uc santa barbara ucsb university of minnesota and pennsylvania state university dow worked with graduate students and faculty to identify areas of improvement and develop a culture of laboratory safety nature conservancyedit in january  the nature conservancy and the dow chemical co announced a collaboration to integrate the value of nature into business decisionmaking scientists engineers and economists from the nature conservancy and dow are working together at three pilot sites north america latin america and tbd to implement and refine models that support corporate decisionmaking related to the value and resources nature provides those ecosystem services include water land air oceans and a variety of plant and animal life these sites will serve as a “living laboratories” to validate and test methods and models so they can be used to inform more sustainable business decisions at dow and hopefully influence the decisionmaking and business practices of other companies outlookedit dow ceo andrew n liveris called  the companys best year ever with operating profits of  billion a jump of  percent compared with the previous year net income rose more than  percent to  billion on sales of  billion  looks as if it could be even better with firstquarter net earnings of  billion all this is occurring in the context of adverse operating conditions caused by high energy and raw material costs and the effects of two damaging hurricanes liveris supports the vertically integrated approach used at dow which produces everything from basic chemical feedstocks to high value products such as pesticides and reverse osmosis membranes these valueadding product chains along with dows wide product range help the company to weather the storms of the global economy despite this high energy and feedstock costs may begin to take their toll particularly if global demand begins to fall just as supply is rising like many chemical companies dow is facing pressures of regulation in the us and europe particularly as the eu introduces its new reach policy litigation costs in the us taken over by dow as a result of
