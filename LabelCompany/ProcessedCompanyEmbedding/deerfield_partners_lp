partners track record why buy a drugstore drugstores for sale contact about walgreens walgreens history rankings  ratings sales  earnings stores nationwide why buy a walgreens cvs or rite aid drugstore secure guaranteed cash flow for  years buying a property net leased to walgreens cvs or rite aid is widely regarded as one of the safest most secure real estate investments unlike many other retail investment properties every property leased by walgreens cvs or rite aid is guaranteed by the full assets of the billion dollar corporations walgreens and cvs have not and will not default rent is paid monthly like clockwork and will be for the next  years of the lease zero landlord responsibilities and zero cost exposure as an owner of a property leased to walgreens cvs or rite aid you will have zero management responsibilities and zero exposure to any unforeseen costs or expenses the standard drugstore lease is truly triplenet nnn meaning that the tenant itself is legally obligated to handle the payment and management of all operating expenses insurance and property taxes as an investor there are no hidden fees and no ownership headaches walgreens or cvs as the tenant is solely responsible for maintenance repair and insurance costs in addition to rent in many ways owning an investment property nnn leased to walgreens or cvs is like owning a corporate bondyour investment will produce a fixed yield to maturity there are no expense pitfalls as can be found in other types of real estate investments leverage depreciation and tax savings owners of drugstore properties enjoy the same financial benefits as all other real estate investors leverage depreciation and tax savings leverage can allow an investor to use borrowed money to maximize cash flow in the shorterterm or structure a longerterm loan for estate planning purposes as a result of walgreens and cvs stellar credit ratings and financial standing there are a variety of financing options available to investors in fact in todays market walgreens and cvs credit is highly sought after by lenders so borrowers are offered more favorable terms than are available for many other commercial property investments depreciation of a commercial real estate investment provides most investors with very significant aftertax savings in fact the tax savings provided by depreciation are often the primary reason investors choose to allocate a portion of their net worth to real estate investments walgreens properties like all commercial property is depreciated over  years on a straightline basis however for the savvy and sophisticated investor returns may be enhanced by accelerated depreciation a great estate planning tool we have found that the vast majority of walgreens and cvs buyers are considering their longerterm family estate planning when acquiring a walgreens property likely for all of the reasons above secure guaranteed cash flow for  years zero landlord responsibilities and zero cost exposure leverage depreciation and tax savings you are buying the best corner in town dont forget that you are buying real estate generally speaking when you buy a property leased to walgreens or cvs you will be buying the best corner in town walgreens and cvs are highly selective in their site selection criteria and most new stores are located at main and main for the past two decades the walgreens and cvs corporate real estate departments have been the darlings of the nnn industry they simply are the best at site selection each site must run through a gauntlet of corporate hurdles including demographic requirements traffic counts cost sales and profitability modeling competitive landscape analysis retail trade area concentration walgreens and cvs are corporations with longterm vision they have a strategy and plan which they have executed well a key component of that strategy is opening stores in locations that will be the most profitable remember when walgreens or cvs signs a lease to open a new store they are committing to pay rent at that location for at least  years as an investor you can rest assured that each location has been thoroughly vetted by walgreens or cvs corporate and as a result may be more likely to hold value or appreciate with future development than any other investment property contact us deerfield partners stevenson stsuite san francisco ca

implicated are collectively responsible for more than  annual deaths in the united states and the economic burden on the public health system due to vhds is estimated in the billions of dollars objective the aim of this study was to assess the number of mitral valve disease hospitalizations and surgical procedures in the united states during the period   materials and methods patient data were extracted from the healthcare cost and utilization project hcup national inpatient sample nis the nis is the largest publicly available allpayer inpatient healthcare database in the united states containing a  stratified systematic random sample of discharges from all us community hospitals the most recent  years of available data  were used for this analysis patients diagnosed with mitral valve disease were identified using the appropriate international classification of diseases th revision icd diagnosis codes icd procedure codes were used to identify surgeries to repair or replace the mitral valve including transcatheter mitral valve repair tmvr open repair tissue graft and synthetic replacement categorical variables were analyzed using the chisquared test while continuous variables were analyzed using a oneway analysis of variance anova or independent samples ttest results there were  discharge records in  with a diagnosis of mitral valve disease using hcup’s sampling weights this extrapolates to  hospitalizations in the united states this is a slight decrease from  when there were  estimated hospitalizations the mean age of patients hospitalized for mitral valve disease increased from   ci  years in  to   ci  years in  p  of mitral valve hospitalizations were females in  compared with  in  p mitral valve surgical procedures increased from  procedures in  to

patients ≥ years of age mitral valve disease represented an increasing proportion of all hospitalizations increasing from  in  to  in  patients with a primary diagnosis of mitral valve disease who underwent a mitral valve surgical procedure were younger on average than those with a primary diagnosis of mitral valve disease who did not undergo a surgical procedure   ci  years vs   ci  years p conclusions this study reveals that mitral valve disease is a considerable public health problem in the united states particularly among older adults during  an increasing proportion of hospitalized patients with mitral valve disease underwent surgical procedures to repair or replace the valve overall the volume of mitral valve surgical procedures increased approximately  from  to    deerfield

publish a report on regulatory and hta scientific advice for small and medium enterprises  march  new york  brusselsbusiness wire europabio the european association for bioindustries and the deerfield institute have partnered to carry out a survey on the current state of regulatory and health technology assessment hta advice with a special focus on small and medium sized enterprises smes the findings suggest early regulatory scientific and hta advice may help smes to better prepare and manage their clinical programs toward facilitating both regulatory approval and positive hta recommendationsand therefore contribute to their increased competitiveness main findings “despite agreement amongst all stakeholders that early interactions between regulatory hta authorities and smes would be positive ensuring that these interactions actually take place is not straightforward given that many smes focus on the early stage of development and can be quite limited in terms of personnel and resources the process of seeking such advice can be perceived as lengthyformal and cumbersome” said miriam gargesi director for healthcare biotechnology at europabio however the findings also show that both the authorities and the smes acknowledged the need to become more flexible and to diversify and increase the number of interactions between them “early dialogue activities have the potential to reduce drug development uncertainties related to regulatory and hta assessments while existing hta scientific advice programs have made a good start and europabio member companies have reported positive experiences so far there are a number of other needs to be metparticularly in the areas of information training and coordination” said paolo morgese director of european research for the deerfield institute and chair of europabio’s hta topic group background phase iii clinical trials are the last and vital development step before submitting healthcare biotech products for approval while the costs for these trials are rising the success rate is still  at phase iii according to the uks centre for medicines research success at phase iii clinical trials is not the end of the story as drugs will still have to go through regulatory and hta evaluation processes before being accessible to european patients reviews from the european medicines agency and to a larger extent from hta authoritieshave proven to be a significant challenge for biotech smes often resulting in very limited access to new biotech drugs against this context and the resulting significant financial burden incurred during phase iii clinical trials companies regulatory and hta authorities are starting to work together at earlier stages of drug development in order to make drug development more efficient this could eventually help companies better understand what data the authorities need earlier in the process thus leading to better designed clinical trials and fewer drugs failing at the approval stage or not being reimbursed the full report is available on the websites of deerfield httpgooglhraum and europabio httpgooglvkdpzz  about europabio europabio is the european association of bio
