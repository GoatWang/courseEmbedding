，每一次交出表現，都顯示出整團準備。菁英盃原意讓青機會，雖賽制上了調整，外援上陣，仍堅持派本地出戰，前天正選名單平均齡，種堅持很艱難，當效果出現，一切都會很值得。 聽過評述員朋友得很搞笑，他形容季初表現：「係，怪」，講得幾準確。 一班青狂練速度，很想做很事情，必須謀。 ，肯定他們！整團態度也很，，、決心也了，怎樣做才可以夾得最？ kevin bond香港為做特訓，八卦去他主持訓練。 ，kevin不魔術師，：「理論訓練方式，處處都很近，教方法也大同小異，別於教完，沒要求達目標」 訓練方法沒大問題，問題於怎樣去設立要求，怎樣令達要求？ kevin主持訓練，似曾識，當熱刺過很次。kevin出身，，做不，他會落場親自捉住，站位置，拉他前後左右，訓練他們要懂得位要位置感。 平們觀眾席，坐bench，得清楚，大叫空位、、．．．球場上觀察球賽角度不同，那位置，又怎預計球參與攻防？眼、腦想、身體怎樣動？ ，學野，更欣賞，團，總李志堅，助教們，，也見他門抄下了很筆記。 團努力決心，球進步，kevin bond主持一星期特訓後，兩埸熱身賽先勝香港代表b，，前天菁英盃再勝，三場見無論防守進攻都明顯很大進歩，可喜，接下，仍需繼續努力。 一場痛快清脆勝利，對團，莫大鼓舞。

，八十代水平現比較，現比起以前可能沒退步，卻沒進步。 鄰近亞洲國家如本，，印尼等水平，三十卻進步了很，深信要令水平進步，需要一十十完善長遠發展計劃，零再開始。 解決訓練場地嚴重不足問題，希望足總認真跟進服政府要提供足夠訓練場地作發展用途，仍然極不足夠！ 需要聘請國際經驗總監（不能總兼仼）名青訓導師，總監要落實訂下安排一長遠青訓計劃。 不現香港本地訓練方式不，總覺得香港靑能夠跟隨一些具國際教頭學習，，亦能夠令他們知道學習現代訓練方式制度與現本土什麼別。 本代，也零開始，當他們聘請了名巴西歐洲著名，要求本土跟隨他們學習，經二十後本國家甚乎大數職球已本本土。 現香港青訓，，每節只鐘，亞洲進步國家，，度追上職業水平，並且學大學高水平訓練接軌，每都能夠訓練出很表現出色供應職業球會。
