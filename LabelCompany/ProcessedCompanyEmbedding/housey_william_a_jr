school after waiting two years to receive an appointment to the united states naval academy halsey decided to study medicine at the university of virginia and then join the navy as a physician he chose virginia because his best friend karl osterhause was there while there halsey joined the delta psi fraternity and was also a member of the secretive seven society after his first year halsey received his appointment to the united states naval academy at annapolis and entered the academy in the fall of  while attending the academy he lettered in football as a fullback and earned several athletic honors halsey graduated from the naval academy on february   following graduation he spent his early service years in battleships and sailed with the main battle fleet aboard the battleship uss kansas bb as roosevelts great white fleet circumnavigated the globe from  to  halsey was on the bridge of the battleship uss missouri on wednesday april   when a flareback from the port gun in her after turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others no explosion occurred but the rapid burning of the powder burnt and suffocated to death  officers and men this resulted in halsey dreading the th of every month especially when it fell on a friday after his service on the missouri halsey served aboard torpedo boats beginning with uss du pont in  halsey was one of the few officers who was promoted directly from ensign to full lieutenant skipping the rank of lieutenant junior grade torpedoes and torpedo boats became specialties of his and he commanded the first group of the atlantic fleets torpedo flotilla in  through  halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and destroyers during the s and s at that time the destroyer and the torpedo boat though extremely hazardous delivery methods were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships lieutenant commander halseys world war i service including command of uss shaw in  earned him the navy cross interwar yearsedit in october  he was the naval attaché at the american embassy in berlin germany one year later he was given additional duty as naval attaché at the american embassies in christiania

his next twoyear stint at sea starting in  as commander destroyer division three of the scouting force before returning to study at the naval war college in newport rhode island in  the chief of the bureau of aeronautics navy admiral ernest king offered halsey command of the aircraft carrier uss saratoga subject to completion of the course of an air observer captain halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full week naval aviator course rather than the simpler naval aviation observer program i thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot halsey earned his naval aviators wings on may   at the age of  the oldest person to do so in the history of the us navy while he had approval from his wife to train as an observer she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training and she told her daughter what do you think that the old fool is doing now hes learning to fly he went on to command the saratoga and later the naval air station pensacola at pensacola florida halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy commenting the naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation and good captain halsey was promoted to rear admiral in  during this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the aircraft battle force world war iiedit traditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines this view was challenged when army airman general billy mitchell demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel in the interwar debate that followed some saw the carrier as defensive in nature providing air cover to protect the battle group from shorebased aircraft carrierbased aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal the adage capital ships cannot withstand landbased air power was well known aviation proponents however imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system when he testified at admiral husband kimmels hearing after the pearl harbor debacle he summed up american carrier tactics being to get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon in april  halseys ships as part of battle fleet moved to hawaii and in june  he was promoted to vice admiral temporary rank appointed commander carrier division  and commander aircraft battle force with tensions high and war imminent us naval intelligence indicated wake island would be the target of a japanese surprise attack in response on  november  admiral kimmel ordered halsey to take uss enterprise to ferry aircraft to wake island to reinforce the marines there kimmel had given halsey a free hand to attack and destroy any japanese military forces encountered the planes flew off her deck on december  highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the japanese carrier force halsey gave orders to sink any shipping sighted shoot down any plane encountered protested his operations officer goddammit admiral you cant start a private war of your own whos going to take the responsibility said halsey ill take it if anything gets in my way well shoot first and argue afterwards a storm delayed enterprise on her return voyage to hawaii instead of returning on december  as planned she was still  miles out at sea when she received word that the surprise attack anticipated was not at wake island but at pearl harbor itself news of the attack came in the form of overhearing desperate radio transmissions from one of her aircraft sent forward to pearl harbor attempting to identify itself as american the plane was shot down and her pilot and crew were lost in the immediate wake of the attack upon pearl harbor admiral kimmel named halsey commander of all the ships at sea enterprise searched south and west of the hawaiian islands for the japanese attackers but did not locate the six japanese fleet carriers then retiring to the north and west early pacific carrier raidsedit an sbd dauntless flies antisubmarine patrol over enterprise and saratoga vice admiral halsey and enterprise slipped back into pearl harbor on the evening of december  surveying the wreckage of the pacific fleet he remarked before were through with them the japanese language will be spoken only in hell halsey was an aggressive commander above all else he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the us navys fighting spirit when most required in the early months of the war as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy serving as commander carrier division  aboard his flagship enterprise halsey led a series of hitandrun raids against the japanese striking the gilbert and marshall islands in february wake island in march and carrying out the doolittle raid in april  against the japanese capital tokyo and other places on japans largest and most populous island honshu the first air raid to strike the japanese home islands providing an important boost to american morale halseys slogan hit hard hit fast hit often soon became a byword for the navy halsey returned to pearl harbor from his last raid on may   in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand he had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier enterprise directing the navys counterstrikes a debilitating chronic skin condition covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching making it nearly impossible for him to sleep gaunt and having lost twenty pounds he was medically ordered to the hospital in hawaii meanwhile us naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the japanese were planning an attack on the central pacific island of midway admiral chester nimitz commander in chief us pacific fleet determined to take the opportunity to engage them losing midway would have been a very serious threat because the japanese then could easily take hawaii and threaten the west coast of the united states the loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral halsey on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to nimitz nimitz met with halsey who recommended his cruiser division commander rear admiral raymond spruance to take command for the upcoming midway operation nimitz considered the move but it would mean stepping over rear admiral frank fletcher of task force  who was the senior of the two men after interviewing fletcher and reviewing his reports from the coral sea engagement nimitz was convinced that fletchers performance was sound and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of midway acting upon halseys recommendations nimitz then made rear admiral spruance commander of halseys task force  comprising the carriers enterprise and hornet to aid spruance who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff captain miles browning the ensuing harrowing battle of midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the united states and a dramatic victory for the us navy halseys skin condition was so serious he was sent on the light cruiser uss detroit to san francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment the skin condition soon receded but halsey was ordered to stand down for the next  weeks and relax while detached stateside during his convalescence he visited family and travelled to washington dc in late august he accepted a speaking engagement at the us naval academy at annapolis prior to the discussion of his raids against the japanese positions in the marshall islands halsey informed the midshipmen before him missing the battle of midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career but i am going back to the pacific where i intend personally to have a crack at those yellowbellied sons of bitches and their carriers which was received with loud applause at the completion of his convalescence in september  admiral nimitz reassigned halsey to commander air force pacific fleet south pacific area commandedit halsey in the south pacific after being medically approved to return to duty halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the south pacific area since enterprise was still laid up in pearl harbor undergoing repairs following the battle of the eastern solomons and the other ships of task force  were still being readied he began a familiarization trip to the south pacific on october   arriving at area headquarters at nouméa in new caledonia on the th the guadalcanal campaign was at a critical juncture with the st marine division  men under the combat command of marine major general alexander a vandergrift holding on by a thread around henderson air field the marines did receive additional support from the us armys th regiment with a complement of  soldiers on october  this addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself during this critical juncture naval support was tenuous due to vice admiral robert l ghormleys reticence malaise and lackluster performance pacific fleet commander chester nimitz had concluded that vice admiral ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted nimitz made his decision to change the south pacific area command while halsey was en route as halseys aircraft came to rest in nouméa a whaleboat came alongside carrying ghormleys flag lieutenant meeting him before he could board the flagship the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from nimitz you will take command of the south pacific area and south pacific forces immediately the order came as an awkward surprise to halsey ghormley was a long time personal friend and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at annapolis awkward or not the two men carried out their directives halseys command now included all ground sea and air forces in the south pacific area news of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered marines energizing his command he was widely considered the us navys most aggressive admiral and with good reason he set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed ghormley had been unsure of his commands ability to maintain the marine toehold on guadalcanal and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the bataan peninsula disaster halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the marines he not only intended to counter the japanese efforts to dislodge them he intended to secure the island above all else he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the japanese it was two days after halsey had taken command in october  that he gave an order that all naval officers in the south pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms as richard frank commented in his account of the battle for guadalcanal halsey said he gave this order to conform to army practice and for comfort to his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war halsey led the south pacific command through what was for the us navy the most tenuous phase of the war halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around guadalcanal including the carrier engagements of the battle of the santa cruz islands and the naval battle of guadalcanal these engagements checked the japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots admirals nimitz and halsey discuss south pacific strategy in early  in november halseys willingness to place at risk his commands two fast battleships in the confined waters around guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the us navy winning the naval battle of guadalcanal the decisive naval engagement of the guadalcanal campaign that doomed the japanese garrison and wrested control from the japanese the solomons campaign ended up being a meat grinder of ijn aviation in april  halsey assigned admiral marc mitscher to commander air solomon islands comairsols where he directed a mixed bag of army navy marine and new zealand aircraft in the airwar over guadalcanal and up the solomon chain said halsey i knew wed probably catch hell from the japs in the air thats why i sent pete mitscher up there pete was a fighting fool and i knew it typical for the period was an exchange that occurred between halsey and one of his staff officers in june  south pacific command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive as a part of the long view of winning the war taken by nimitz upon its arrival at fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training south pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the solomon chain the staff officer who brought the dispatch to halsey remarked if they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive the admiral turned to the speaker and replied as long as i have one plane and one pilot i will stay on the offensive admiral halseys forces spent the rest of the year battling up the solomon islands chain to bougainville at bougainville the japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island and another at the northern most peninsula with a fourth on buki just across the northern passage here instead of landing near the japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the japanese defenders halsey landed his invasion force of  marines in empress augusta bay about halfway up the west coast of bougainville there he had the seabees clear and build their own airfield two days after the landing a large cruiser force was sent down from japan to rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against halseys screening force and supply ships in empress augusta bay the japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers along with one light cruiser and four destroyers at rabaul the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them the battleships washington south dakota and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the central pacific to support the upcoming invasion of tarawa other than the destroyer screen the only force halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on saratoga and princeton rabaul was a heavily fortified port with five airfields and extensive antiaircraft batteries other than the surprise raid at pearl harbor no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft it was highly dangerous to the aircrews and to the carriers as well with the landing in the balance halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of rabaul then launch a daybreak raid on the base aircraft from recently captured vella lavella were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers all available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself the mission was a stunning success so damaging the cruiser force at rabaul as to make them no longer a threat aircraft losses in the raid were light halsey later described the threat to the landings the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as comsopac following the successful bougainville operation he then isolated and neutralized the japanese naval stronghold at rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the bismarck archipelago in a series of amphibious landings known as operation cartwheel this enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself with the neutralization of rabaul major operations in the south pacific command came to a close with his determination and grit halsey had bolstered his commands resolve and seized the initiative from the japanese until ships aircraft and crews produced and trained in the states could arrive in  and  to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies battles of the central pacificedit adm halsey confers with task force  commander and fellow dirty trickster adm john s mccain sr on board halseys flagship the uss new jersey  as the war progressed it moved out of the south pacific and into the central pacific admiral halseys command shifted with it and in may  he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed third fleet he commanded actions from the philippines to japan from september  to january  he led the campaigns to take the palaus leyte and luzon and on many raids on japanese bases including off the shores of formosa china and vietnam by this point in the conflict the us navy was doing things the japanese high command had not thought possible the fast carrier task force was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in moreover the navys ability to establish forward operating ports as they did at majuro enewetak and ulithi and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western pacific the japanese navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy the us navy remained at sea and on station dominating whatever region it entered the size of the pacific ocean which japanese planners had thought would limit the us navys ability to operate in the western pacific would not be adequate to protect japan command of the big blue fleet was alternated with raymond spruancen  under spruance the fleet designation was the fifth fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  under halsey the fleet was designated third fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  the split command structure was intended to confuse the japanese and created a higher tempo of operations while spruance was at sea operating the fleet halsey and his staff selfdubbed the department of dirty tricks would be planning the next series of operations the two admirals were a contrast in styles halsey was aggressive and a risk taker spruance was calculating professional and cautious most higherranking officers preferred to serve under spruance most common sailors were proud to serve under halsey leyte gulfedit halsey dines with crew of uss new jersey november  in october  amphibious forces of the us seventh fleet carried out general douglas macarthurs major landings on the island of leyte in the central philippines halseys third fleet was assigned to cover and support seventh fleet operations around leyte halseys plans assumed the japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort creating an opportunity to engage it decisively halsey directed the third fleet will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces in response to the invasion the japanese launched their final major naval effort an operation known as shogo involving almost all their surviving fleet it was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the leyte gulf the northern force of admiral ozawa was built around the remaining japanese aircraft carriers now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots the northern force was meant to lure the covering us forces away from the gulf while two surface battlegroups the center force and the southern force were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping these forces were built around the remaining strength of the japanese navy and comprised a total of  battleships and  cruisers the operation brought about the battle for leyte gulf the largest naval battle of the second world war and by some criteria the largest naval battle in history the center force commanded by vice admiral takeo kurita was located october  coming through the palawan passage by two american submarines which attacked the force sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third the following day third fleets aircraft carriers launched strikes against kuritas center force sinking the battleship musashi and damaging the heavy cruiser myōkō causing the force to turn westward back towards its base kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the san bernardino strait at this point ozawas northern force was located by third fleet scout aircraft halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the japanese carrier forces planning to strike them at dawn of october  he considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait and made tentative plans to do so but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover weakening his chance to crush the remaining japanese carrier forces the entire third fleet steamed northward san bernardino strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet battle off samaredit in moving third fleet northwards halsey failed to advise admiral thomas kinkaid of seventh fleet of his decision seventh fleet intercepts of organizational messages from halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the san bernardino strait but this was not the case kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with halsey and neither had confirmed this with nimitz despite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of – october of kuritas center force in the san bernardino strait halsey continued to take third fleet northwards away from leyte gulf halsey with vice admiral john s mccain sr when kuritas center force emerged from the san bernardino strait on the morning of october  there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and destroyer escorts task unit  taffy  which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarinesclarification needed not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since midway led by the largest battleship in the world advancing down the coast of the island of samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the leyte gulf landing they took seventh fleets escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise in the desperate battle off samar which followed kuritas ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers screen and damaging a number of other ships as well the remarkable resistance of the screening ships of the escort carrier groups against kuritas battlegroup remains one of the most heroic feats in the storied history of the us navy their efforts and those of the aircraft that the escort carriers could put up took a heavy toll on kuritas ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case mistaking the escort carriers for halseys fleet carriers and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the third fleet battleship group he decided to withdraw back through the san bernardino strait and to the west without achieving his objective of the leyte landing when the seventh fleets escort carriers found themselves under attack from the center force halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off samar for over two hours halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls then shortly after  hours a message was received from admiral nimitz where is repeat where is task force  the world wonders the tail end of this message the world wonders was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to halsey the urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke the fiery halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing finally halseys chief of staff rear admiral robert mick carney confronted him telling halsey stop it what the hells the matter with you pull yourself together halsey cooled but continued to steam third fleet northward to close on ozawas northern force for a full hour after receiving the signal from nimitz then halsey ordered task force  south as task force  proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to  knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers the refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay by the time task force  arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the seventh fleets escort carrier groups kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area a single straggling destroyer was caught by halseys advance cruisers and destroyers but the rest of kuritas force was able to escape meanwhile the major part third fleet continued to close on ozawas northern force which included one fleet carrier the last surviving japanese carrier of the six that had attacked pearl harbor and three light carriers the battle of cape engaño resulted in halseys third fleet sinking all four of ozawas carriers the same attributes that made halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war his desire to bring the fight to the enemy his willingness to take on a gamble worked against him in the later stages of the war halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle with naval historian samuel morison terming the third fleet run to the north halseys blunder however the destruction of the japanese carriers had been the prime goal of pacific naval battles up to that point and the failure to pursue the japanese fleet carriers and destroy them had been a major criticism of spruance in some circles whose fifth fleet missed the opportunity at the battle of the philippine sean  halseys typhoonedit main article typhoon cobra  uss langley struggles in typhoon cobra after the leyte gulf engagement december found the third fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of typhoon cobra which was dubbed halseys typhoon by many while conducting operations off the philippines the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a pacific storm rather than move third fleet away halsey chose to remain on station for another day in fairness he received conflicting information from pearl harbor and his own staff the hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm which would have cleared task force  by some two hundred miles eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction however halsey played the odds declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of third fleet to hold formation on the evening of december  the combat air patrol over third fleet was unable to land their aircraft aboard the pitching and rolling carriers the pilots were forced to ditch in the ocean the aircraft were lost but all the pilots were picked up by escorting destroyers by  am the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously still the fleet attempted to maintain stations finally at  am halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them something which many ships had already been forced to do between  am and  pm the typhoon did its worst damage tossing the ships in seventyfoot waves the barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at eightythree knots with gusts well over  knots at  pm halsey issued a typhoon warning to fleet weather central by this time the third fleet had already lost three destroyers the storm inflicted damage on a great many ships in the fleet with the loss of some  men and  aircraft third fleet conducted search and rescue operations for three days following the storm finally retiring for repairs at ulithi on december  following the typhoon a navy court of inquiry was convened on board the uss cascade ad in the naval base at ulithi admiral nimitz cincpac was in attendance at the court fortythreeyearold captain herbert k gates of the cascade was the judge advocate the inquiry found that though halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the third fleet into the heart of the typhoon it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction the events surrounding typhoon cobra were similar to those the japanese navy itself faced some nine years earlier in what they termed the fourth fleet incident end of the waredit fleet admiral nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board uss missouri behind him stand gen douglas macarthur adm william halsey and rear adm forrest sherman during january  the third fleet attacked formosa and luzon and raided the south china sea in support of the landing of us army forces on luzon at the conclusion of this operation halsey passed command of the ships that made up third fleet to admiral spruance on  january whereupon its designation changed to fifth fleet returning home halsey was asked about general macarthur general macarthur was not the easiest man to work with and vied with the navy over the conduct and management of the war in the pacific halsey had worked well with macarthur and did not mind saying so when a reporter asked halsey if he thought general macarthurs fleet th fleet would get to tokyo first the admiral grinned and answered were going there together then seriously he added hes a very fine man i have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him spruance held command of th fleet until may when command returned to halsey in early june  rd fleet again sailed through the path of typhoon connie on this occasion six men were swept overboard and lost along with  airplanes lost or destroyed with another  badly damaged though some ships sustained significant damage none were lost a navy court of inquiry was again convened this time recommending that halsey be reassigned but admiral nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation citing halseys prior service record halsey led third fleet through the final stages of the war striking targets on the japanese homeland itself third fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon tokyo the naval base at kure and the northern japanese island of hokkaidō and third fleet battleships engaged in the bombardment of a number of japanese coastal cities in preparation for an invasion of japan which ultimately never had to be undertaken after the cessation of hostilities halsey still aggressively cautious of japanese kamikaze attacks ordered third fleet to maintain a protective air cover with the following communiqué cessation of hostilities war is over if any japanese airplanes appear shoot them down in a friendly way he was present when japan formally surrendered on the deck of his flagship uss missouri on september   postwar yearsedit halsey immediately

senator rufus king who was an american lawyer politician diplomat and federalist halsey attended the pingry school after waiting two years to receive an appointment to the united states naval academy halsey decided to study medicine at the university of virginia and then join the navy as a physician he chose virginia because his best friend karl osterhause was there while there halsey joined the delta psi fraternity and was also a member of the secretive seven society after his first year halsey received his appointment to the united states naval academy at annapolis and entered the academy in the fall of  while attending the academy he lettered in football as a fullback and earned several athletic honors halsey graduated from the naval academy on february   following graduation he spent his early service years in battleships and sailed with the main battle fleet aboard the battleship uss kansas bb as roosevelts great white fleet circumnavigated the globe from  to  halsey was on the bridge of the battleship uss missouri on wednesday april   when a flareback from the port gun in her after turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others no explosion occurred but the rapid burning of the powder burnt and suffocated to death  officers and men this resulted in halsey dreading the th of every month especially when it fell on a friday after his service on the missouri halsey served aboard torpedo boats beginning with uss du pont in  halsey was one of the few officers who was promoted directly from ensign to full lieutenant skipping the rank of lieutenant junior grade torpedoes and torpedo boats became specialties of his and he commanded the first group of the atlantic fleets torpedo flotilla in  through  halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and destroyers during the s and s at that time the destroyer and the torpedo boat though extremely hazardous delivery methods were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships lieutenant commander halseys world war i service including command of uss shaw in  earned him the navy cross interwar yearsedit in october  he was the naval attaché at the american embassy in berlin germany one year later he was given additional duty as naval attaché at the american embassies in christiania norway copenhagen denmark and stockholm sweden he then returned to sea duty again in destroyers in european waters in command of uss dale and uss osborne upon his return to the us in  he served one year as executive officer of the battleship uss wyoming and then for three years in

the scouting force before returning to study at the naval war college in newport rhode island in  the chief of the bureau of aeronautics navy admiral ernest king offered halsey command of the aircraft carrier uss saratoga subject to completion of the course of an air observer captain halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full week naval aviator course rather than the simpler naval aviation observer program i thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot halsey earned his naval aviators wings on may   at the age of  the oldest person to do so in the history of the us navy while he had approval from his wife to train as an observer she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training and she told her daughter what do you think that the old fool is doing now hes learning to fly he went on to command the saratoga and later the naval air station pensacola at pensacola florida halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy commenting the naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation and good captain halsey was promoted to rear admiral in  during this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the aircraft battle force world war iiedit traditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines this view was challenged when army airman general billy mitchell demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel in the interwar debate that followed some saw the carrier as defensive in nature providing air cover to protect the battle group from shorebased aircraft carrierbased aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal the adage capital ships cannot withstand landbased air power was well known aviation proponents however imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system when he testified at admiral husband kimmels hearing after the pearl harbor debacle he summed up american carrier tactics being to get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon in april  halseys ships as part of battle fleet moved to hawaii and in june  he was promoted to vice admiral temporary rank appointed commander carrier division  and commander aircraft battle force with tensions high and war imminent us naval intelligence indicated wake island would be the target of a japanese surprise attack in response on  november  admiral kimmel ordered halsey to take uss enterprise to ferry aircraft to wake island to reinforce the marines there kimmel had given halsey a free hand to attack and destroy any japanese military forces encountered the planes flew off her deck on december  highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the japanese carrier force halsey gave orders to sink any shipping sighted shoot down any plane encountered protested his operations officer goddammit admiral you cant start a private war of your own whos going to take the responsibility said halsey ill take it if anything gets in my way well shoot first and argue afterwards a storm delayed enterprise on her return voyage to hawaii instead of returning on december  as planned she was still  miles out at sea when she received word that the surprise attack anticipated was not at wake island but at pearl harbor itself news of the attack came in the form of overhearing desperate radio transmissions from one of her aircraft sent forward to pearl harbor attempting to identify itself as american the plane was shot down and her pilot and crew were lost in the immediate wake of the attack upon pearl harbor admiral kimmel named halsey commander of all the ships at sea enterprise searched south and west of the hawaiian islands for the japanese attackers but did not locate the six japanese fleet carriers then retiring to the north and west early pacific carrier raidsedit an sbd dauntless flies antisubmarine patrol over enterprise and saratoga vice admiral halsey and enterprise slipped back into pearl harbor on the evening of december  surveying the wreckage of the pacific fleet he remarked before were through with them the japanese language will be spoken only in hell halsey was an aggressive commander above all else he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the us navys fighting spirit when most required in the early months of the war as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy serving as commander carrier division  aboard his flagship enterprise halsey led a series of hitandrun raids against the japanese striking the gilbert and marshall islands in february wake island in march and carrying out the doolittle raid in april  against the japanese capital tokyo and other places on japans largest and most populous island honshu the first air raid to strike the japanese home islands providing an important boost to american morale halseys slogan hit hard hit fast hit often soon became a byword for the navy halsey returned to pearl harbor from his last raid on may   in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand he had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier enterprise directing the navys counterstrikes a debilitating chronic skin condition covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching making it nearly impossible for him to sleep gaunt and having lost twenty pounds he was medically ordered to the hospital in hawaii meanwhile us naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the japanese were planning an attack on the central pacific island of midway admiral chester nimitz commander in chief us pacific fleet determined to take the opportunity to engage them losing midway would have been a very serious threat because the japanese then could easily take hawaii and threaten the west coast of the united states the loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral halsey on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to nimitz nimitz met with halsey who recommended his cruiser division commander rear admiral raymond spruance to take command for the upcoming midway operation nimitz considered the move but it would mean stepping over rear admiral frank fletcher of task force  who was the senior of the two men after interviewing fletcher and reviewing his reports from the coral sea engagement nimitz was convinced that fletchers performance was sound and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of midway acting upon halseys recommendations nimitz then made rear admiral spruance commander of halseys task force  comprising the carriers enterprise and hornet to aid spruance who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff captain miles browning the ensuing harrowing battle of midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the united states and a dramatic victory for the us navy halseys skin condition was so serious he was sent on the light cruiser uss detroit to san francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment the skin condition soon receded but halsey was ordered to stand down for the next  weeks and relax while detached stateside during his convalescence he visited family and travelled to washington dc in late august he accepted a speaking engagement at the us naval academy at annapolis prior to the discussion of his raids against the japanese positions in the marshall islands halsey informed the midshipmen before him missing the battle of midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career but i am going back to the pacific where i intend personally to have a crack at those yellowbellied sons of bitches and their carriers which was received with loud applause at the completion of his convalescence in september  admiral nimitz reassigned halsey to commander air force pacific fleet south pacific area commandedit halsey in the south pacific after being medically approved to return to duty halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the south pacific area since enterprise was still laid up in pearl harbor undergoing repairs following the battle of the eastern solomons and the other ships of task force  were still being readied he began a familiarization trip to the south pacific on october   arriving at area headquarters at nouméa in new caledonia on the th the guadalcanal campaign was at a critical juncture with the st marine division  men under the combat command of marine major general alexander a vandergrift holding on by a thread around henderson air field the marines did receive additional support from the us armys th regiment with a complement of  soldiers on october  this addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself during this critical juncture naval support was tenuous due to vice admiral robert l ghormleys reticence malaise and lackluster performance pacific fleet commander chester nimitz had concluded that vice admiral ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted nimitz made his decision to change the south pacific area command while halsey was en route as halseys aircraft came to rest in nouméa a whaleboat came alongside carrying ghormleys flag lieutenant meeting him before he could board the flagship the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from nimitz you will take command of the south pacific area and south pacific forces immediately the order came as an awkward surprise to halsey ghormley was a long time personal friend and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at annapolis awkward or not the two men carried out their directives halseys command now included all ground sea and air forces in the south pacific area news of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered marines energizing his command he was widely considered the us navys most aggressive admiral and with good reason he set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed ghormley had been unsure of his commands ability to maintain the marine toehold on guadalcanal and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the bataan peninsula disaster halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the marines he not only intended to counter the japanese efforts to dislodge them he intended to secure the island above all else he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the japanese it was two days after halsey had taken command in october  that he gave an order that all naval officers in the south pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms as richard frank commented in his account of the battle for guadalcanal halsey said he gave this order to conform to army practice and for comfort to his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war halsey led the south pacific command through what was for the us navy the most tenuous phase of the war halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around guadalcanal including the carrier engagements of the battle of the santa cruz islands and the naval battle of guadalcanal these engagements checked the japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots admirals nimitz and halsey discuss south pacific strategy in early  in november halseys willingness to place at risk his commands two fast battleships in the confined waters around guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the us navy winning the naval battle of guadalcanal the decisive naval engagement of the guadalcanal campaign that doomed the japanese garrison and wrested control from the japanese the solomons campaign ended up being a meat grinder of ijn aviation in april  halsey assigned admiral marc mitscher to commander air solomon islands comairsols where he directed a mixed bag of army navy marine and new zealand aircraft in the airwar over guadalcanal and up the solomon chain said halsey i knew wed probably catch hell from the japs in the air thats why i sent pete mitscher up there pete was a fighting fool and i knew it typical for the period was an exchange that occurred between halsey and one of his staff officers in june  south pacific command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive as a part of the long view of winning the war taken by nimitz upon its arrival at fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training south pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the solomon chain the staff officer who brought the dispatch to halsey remarked if they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive the admiral turned to the speaker and replied as long as i have one plane and one pilot i will stay on the offensive admiral halseys forces spent the rest of the year battling up the solomon islands chain to bougainville at bougainville the japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island and another at the northern most peninsula with a fourth on buki just across the northern passage here instead of landing near the japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the japanese defenders halsey landed his invasion force of  marines in empress augusta bay about halfway up the west coast of bougainville there he had the seabees clear and build their own airfield two days after the landing a large cruiser force was sent down from japan to rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against halseys screening force and supply ships in empress augusta bay the japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers along with one light cruiser and four destroyers at rabaul the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them the battleships washington south dakota and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the central pacific to support the upcoming invasion of tarawa other than the destroyer screen the only force halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on saratoga and princeton rabaul was a heavily fortified port with five airfields and extensive antiaircraft batteries other than the surprise raid at pearl harbor no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft it was highly dangerous to the aircrews and to the carriers as well with the landing in the balance halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of rabaul then launch a daybreak raid on the base aircraft from recently captured vella lavella were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers all available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself the mission was a stunning success so damaging the cruiser force at rabaul as to make them no longer a threat aircraft losses in the raid were light halsey later described the threat to the landings the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as comsopac following the successful bougainville operation he then isolated and neutralized the japanese naval stronghold at rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the bismarck archipelago in a series of amphibious landings known as operation cartwheel this enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself with the neutralization of rabaul major operations in the south pacific command came to a close with his determination and grit halsey had bolstered his commands resolve and seized the initiative from the japanese until ships aircraft and crews produced and trained in the states could arrive in  and  to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies battles of the central pacificedit adm halsey confers with task force  commander and fellow dirty trickster adm john s mccain sr on board halseys flagship the uss new jersey  as the war progressed it moved out of the south pacific and into the central pacific admiral halseys command shifted with it and in may  he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed third fleet he commanded actions from the philippines to japan from september  to january  he led the campaigns to take the palaus leyte and luzon and on many raids on japanese bases including off the shores of formosa china and vietnam by this point in the conflict the us navy was doing things the japanese high command had not thought possible the fast carrier task force was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in moreover the navys ability to establish forward operating ports as they did at majuro enewetak and ulithi and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western pacific the japanese navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy the us navy remained at sea and on station dominating whatever region it entered the size of the pacific ocean which japanese planners had thought would limit the us navys ability to operate in the western pacific would not be adequate to protect japan command of the big blue fleet was alternated with raymond spruancen  under spruance the fleet designation was the fifth fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  under halsey the fleet was designated third fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  the split command structure was intended to confuse the japanese and created a higher tempo of operations while spruance was at sea operating the fleet halsey and his staff selfdubbed the department of dirty tricks would be planning the next series of operations the two admirals were a contrast in styles halsey was aggressive and a risk taker spruance was calculating professional and cautious most higherranking officers preferred to serve under spruance most common sailors were proud to serve under halsey leyte gulfedit halsey dines with crew of uss new jersey november  in october  amphibious forces of the us seventh fleet carried out general douglas macarthurs major landings on the island of leyte in the central philippines halseys third fleet was assigned to cover and support seventh fleet operations around leyte halseys plans assumed the japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort creating an opportunity to engage it decisively halsey directed the third fleet will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces in response to the invasion the japanese launched their final major naval effort an operation known as shogo involving almost all their surviving fleet it was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the leyte gulf the northern force of admiral ozawa was built around the remaining japanese aircraft carriers now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots the northern force was meant to lure the covering us forces away from the gulf while two surface battlegroups the center force and the southern force were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping these forces were built around the remaining strength of the japanese navy and comprised a total of  battleships and  cruisers the operation brought about the battle for leyte gulf the largest naval battle of the second world war and by some criteria the largest naval battle in history the center force commanded by vice admiral takeo kurita was located october  coming through the palawan passage by two american submarines which attacked the force sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third the following day third fleets aircraft carriers launched strikes against kuritas center force sinking the battleship musashi and damaging the heavy cruiser myōkō causing the force to turn westward back towards its base kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the san bernardino strait at this point ozawas northern force was located by third fleet scout aircraft halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the japanese carrier forces planning to strike them at dawn of october  he considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait and made tentative plans to do so but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover weakening his chance to crush the remaining japanese carrier forces the entire third fleet steamed northward san bernardino strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet battle off samaredit in moving third fleet northwards halsey failed to advise admiral thomas kinkaid of seventh fleet of his decision seventh fleet intercepts of organizational messages from halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the san bernardino strait but this was not the case kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with halsey and neither had confirmed this with nimitz despite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of – october of kuritas center force in the san bernardino strait halsey continued to take third fleet northwards away from leyte gulf halsey with vice admiral john s mccain sr when kuritas center force emerged from the san bernardino strait on the morning of october  there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and destroyer escorts task unit  taffy  which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarinesclarification needed not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since midway led by the largest battleship in the world advancing down the coast of the island of samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the leyte gulf landing they took seventh fleets escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise in the desperate battle off samar which followed kuritas ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers screen and damaging a number of other ships as well the remarkable resistance of the screening ships of the escort carrier groups against kuritas battlegroup remains one of the most heroic feats in the storied history of the us navy their efforts and those of the aircraft that the escort carriers could put up took a heavy toll on kuritas ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case mistaking the escort carriers for halseys fleet carriers and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the third fleet battleship group he decided to withdraw back through the san bernardino strait and to the west without achieving his objective of the leyte landing when the seventh fleets escort carriers found themselves under attack from the center force halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off samar for over two hours halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls then shortly after  hours a message was received from admiral nimitz where is repeat where is task force  the world wonders the tail end of this message the world wonders was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to halsey the urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke the fiery halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing finally halseys chief of staff rear admiral robert mick carney confronted him telling halsey stop it what the hells the matter with you pull yourself together halsey cooled but continued to steam third fleet northward to close on ozawas northern force for a full hour after receiving the signal from nimitz then halsey ordered task force  south as task force  proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to  knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers the refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay by the time task force  arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the seventh fleets escort carrier groups kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area a single straggling destroyer was caught by halseys advance cruisers and destroyers but the rest of kuritas force was able to escape meanwhile the major part third fleet continued to close on ozawas northern force which included one fleet carrier the last surviving japanese carrier of the six that had attacked pearl harbor and three light carriers the battle of cape engaño resulted in halseys third fleet sinking all four of ozawas carriers the same attributes that made halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war his desire to bring the fight to the enemy his willingness to take on a gamble worked against him in the later stages of the war halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle with naval historian samuel morison terming the third fleet run to the north halseys blunder however the destruction of the japanese carriers had been the prime goal of pacific naval battles up to that point and the failure to pursue the japanese fleet carriers and destroy them had been a major criticism of spruance in some circles whose fifth fleet missed the opportunity at the battle of the philippine sean  halseys typhoonedit main article typhoon cobra  uss langley struggles in typhoon cobra after the leyte gulf engagement december found the third fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of typhoon cobra which was dubbed halseys typhoon by many while conducting operations off the philippines the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a pacific storm rather than move third fleet away halsey chose to remain on station for another day in fairness he received conflicting information from pearl harbor and his own staff the hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm which would have cleared task force  by some two hundred miles eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction however halsey played the odds declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of third fleet to hold formation on the evening of december  the combat air patrol over third fleet was unable to land their aircraft aboard the pitching and rolling carriers the pilots were forced to ditch in the ocean the aircraft were lost but all the pilots were picked up by escorting destroyers by  am the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously still the fleet attempted to maintain stations finally at  am halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them something which many ships had already been forced to do between  am and  pm the typhoon did its worst damage tossing the ships in seventyfoot waves the barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at eightythree knots with gusts well over  knots at  pm halsey issued a typhoon warning to fleet weather central by this time the third fleet had already lost three destroyers the storm inflicted damage on a great many ships in the fleet with the loss of some  men and  aircraft third fleet conducted search and rescue operations for three days following the storm finally retiring for repairs at ulithi on december  following the typhoon a navy court of inquiry was convened on board the uss cascade ad in the naval base at ulithi admiral nimitz cincpac was in attendance at the court fortythreeyearold captain herbert k gates of the cascade was the judge advocate the inquiry found that though halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the third fleet into the heart of the typhoon it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction the events surrounding typhoon cobra were similar to those the japanese navy itself faced some nine years earlier in what they termed the fourth fleet incident end of the waredit fleet admiral nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board uss missouri behind him stand gen douglas macarthur adm william halsey and rear adm forrest sherman during january  the third fleet attacked formosa and luzon and raided the south china sea in support of the landing of us army forces on luzon at the conclusion of this operation halsey passed command of the ships that made up third fleet to admiral spruance on  january whereupon its designation changed to fifth fleet returning home halsey was asked about general macarthur general macarthur was not the easiest man to work with and vied with the navy over the conduct and management of the war in the pacific halsey had worked well with macarthur and did not mind saying so when a reporter asked halsey if he thought general macarthurs fleet th fleet would get to tokyo first the admiral grinned and answered were going there together then seriously he added hes a very fine man i have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him spruance held command of th fleet until may when command returned to halsey in early june  rd fleet again sailed through the path of typhoon connie on this occasion six men were swept overboard and lost along with  airplanes lost or destroyed with another  badly damaged though some ships sustained significant damage none were lost a navy court of inquiry was again convened this time recommending that halsey be reassigned but admiral nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation citing halseys prior service record halsey led third fleet through the final stages of the war striking targets on the japanese homeland itself third fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon tokyo the naval base at kure and the northern japanese island of hokkaidō and third fleet battleships engaged in the bombardment of a number of japanese coastal cities in preparation for an invasion of japan which ultimately never had to be undertaken after the cessation of hostilities halsey still aggressively cautious of japanese kamikaze attacks

bridge of the battleship uss missouri on wednesday april   when a flareback from the port gun in her after turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others no explosion occurred but the rapid burning of the powder burnt and suffocated to death  officers and men this resulted in halsey dreading the th of every month especially when it fell on a friday after his service on the missouri

grade torpedoes and torpedo boats became specialties of his and he commanded the first group of the atlantic fleets torpedo flotilla in  through  halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and destroyers during the s and s at that time the destroyer and the torpedo boat though extremely hazardous delivery methods were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships lieutenant commander halseys world war i service including command of uss shaw in  earned him the navy cross interwar yearsedit in october  he was the naval attaché at the american embassy in

the scouting force before returning to study at the naval war college in newport rhode island in  the chief of the bureau of aeronautics navy admiral ernest king offered halsey command of the aircraft carrier uss saratoga subject to completion of the course of an air observer captain halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full week naval aviator course rather than the simpler naval aviation observer program i thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot halsey earned his naval aviators wings on may   at the age of  the oldest person to do so in the history of the us navy while he had approval from his wife to train as an observer she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training and she told her daughter what do you think that the old fool is doing now hes learning to fly he went on to command the saratoga and later the naval air station pensacola at pensacola florida halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy commenting the naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation and good captain halsey was promoted to rear admiral in  during this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the aircraft battle force world war iiedit traditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines this view was challenged when army airman general billy mitchell demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel in the interwar debate that followed some saw the carrier as defensive in nature providing air cover to protect the battle group from shorebased aircraft carrierbased aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal the adage capital ships cannot withstand landbased air power was well known aviation proponents however imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system when he testified at admiral husband kimmels hearing after the pearl harbor debacle he summed up american carrier tactics being to get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon in april  halseys ships as part of battle fleet moved to hawaii and in june  he was promoted to vice admiral temporary rank appointed commander carrier division  and commander aircraft battle force with tensions high and war imminent us naval intelligence indicated wake island would be the target of a japanese surprise attack in response on  november  admiral kimmel ordered halsey to take uss enterprise to ferry aircraft to wake island to reinforce the marines there kimmel had given halsey a free hand to attack and destroy any japanese military forces encountered the planes flew off her deck on december  highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the japanese carrier force halsey gave orders to sink any shipping sighted shoot down any plane encountered protested his operations officer goddammit admiral you cant start a private war of your own whos going to take the responsibility said halsey ill take it if anything gets in my way well shoot first and argue afterwards a storm delayed enterprise on her return voyage to hawaii instead of returning on december  as planned she was still  miles out at sea when she received word that the surprise attack anticipated was not at wake island but at pearl harbor itself news of the attack came in the form of overhearing desperate radio transmissions from one of her aircraft sent forward to pearl harbor attempting to identify itself as american the plane was shot down and her pilot and crew were lost in the immediate wake of the attack upon pearl harbor admiral kimmel named halsey commander of all the ships at sea enterprise searched south and west of the hawaiian islands for the japanese attackers but did not locate the six japanese fleet carriers then retiring to the north and west early pacific carrier raidsedit an sbd dauntless flies antisubmarine patrol over enterprise and saratoga vice admiral halsey and enterprise slipped back into pearl harbor on the evening of december  surveying the wreckage of the pacific fleet he remarked before were through with them the japanese language will be spoken only in hell halsey was an aggressive commander above all else he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the us navys fighting spirit when most required in the early months of the war as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy serving as commander carrier division  aboard his flagship enterprise halsey led a series of hitandrun raids against the japanese striking the gilbert and marshall islands in february wake island in march and carrying out the doolittle raid in april  against the japanese capital tokyo and other places on japans largest and most populous island honshu the first air raid to strike the japanese home islands providing an important boost to american morale halseys slogan hit hard hit fast hit often soon became a byword for the navy halsey returned to pearl harbor from his last raid on may   in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand he had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier enterprise directing the navys counterstrikes a debilitating chronic skin condition covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching making it nearly impossible for him to sleep gaunt and having lost twenty pounds he was medically ordered to the hospital in hawaii meanwhile us naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the japanese were planning an attack on the central pacific island of midway admiral chester nimitz commander in chief us pacific fleet determined to take the opportunity to engage them losing midway would have been a very serious threat because the japanese then could easily take hawaii and threaten the west coast of the united states the loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral halsey on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to nimitz nimitz met with halsey who recommended his cruiser division commander rear admiral raymond spruance to take command for the upcoming midway operation nimitz considered the move but it would mean stepping over rear admiral frank fletcher of task force  who was the senior of the two men after interviewing fletcher and reviewing his reports from the coral sea engagement nimitz was convinced that fletchers performance was sound and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of midway acting upon halseys recommendations nimitz then made rear admiral spruance commander of halseys task force  comprising the carriers enterprise and hornet to aid spruance who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff captain miles browning the ensuing harrowing battle of midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the united states and a dramatic victory for the us navy halseys skin condition was so serious he was sent on the light cruiser uss detroit to san francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment the skin condition soon receded but halsey was ordered to stand down for the next  weeks and relax while detached stateside during his convalescence he visited family and travelled to washington dc in late august he accepted a speaking engagement at the us naval academy at annapolis prior to the discussion of his raids against the japanese positions in the marshall islands halsey informed the midshipmen before him missing the battle of midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career but i am going back to the pacific where i intend personally to have a crack at those yellowbellied sons of bitches and their carriers which was received with loud applause at the completion of his convalescence in september  admiral nimitz reassigned halsey to commander air force pacific fleet south pacific area commandedit halsey in the south pacific after being medically approved to return to duty halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the south pacific area since enterprise was still laid up in pearl harbor undergoing repairs following the battle of the eastern solomons and the other ships of task force  were still being readied he began a familiarization trip to the south pacific on october   arriving at area headquarters at nouméa in new caledonia on the th the guadalcanal campaign was at a critical juncture with the st marine division  men under the combat command of marine major general alexander a vandergrift holding on by a thread around henderson air field the marines did receive additional support from the us armys th regiment with a complement of  soldiers on october  this addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself during this critical juncture naval support was tenuous due to vice admiral robert l ghormleys reticence malaise and lackluster performance pacific fleet commander chester nimitz had concluded that vice admiral ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted nimitz made his decision to change the south pacific area command while halsey was en route as halseys aircraft came to rest in nouméa a whaleboat came alongside carrying ghormleys flag lieutenant meeting him before he could board the flagship the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from nimitz you will take command of the south pacific area and south pacific forces immediately the order came as an awkward surprise to halsey ghormley was a long time personal friend and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at annapolis awkward or not the two men carried out their directives halseys command now included all ground sea and air forces in the south pacific area news of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered marines energizing his command he was widely considered the us navys most aggressive admiral and with good reason he set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed ghormley had been unsure of his commands ability to maintain the marine toehold on guadalcanal and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the bataan peninsula disaster halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the marines he not only intended to counter the japanese efforts to dislodge them he intended to secure the island above all else he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the japanese it was two days after halsey had taken command in october  that he gave an order that all naval officers in the south pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms as richard frank commented in his account of the battle for guadalcanal halsey said he gave this order to conform to army practice and for comfort to his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war halsey led the south pacific command through what was for the us navy the most tenuous phase of the war halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around guadalcanal including the carrier engagements of the battle of the santa cruz islands and the naval battle of guadalcanal these engagements checked the japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots admirals nimitz and halsey discuss south pacific strategy in early  in november halseys willingness to place at risk his commands two fast battleships in the confined waters around guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the us navy winning the naval battle of guadalcanal the decisive naval engagement of the guadalcanal campaign that doomed the japanese garrison and wrested control from the japanese the solomons campaign ended up being a meat grinder of ijn aviation in april  halsey assigned admiral marc mitscher to commander air solomon islands comairsols where he directed a mixed bag of army navy marine and new zealand aircraft in the airwar over guadalcanal and up the solomon chain said halsey i knew wed probably catch hell from the japs in the air thats why i sent pete mitscher up there pete was a fighting fool and i knew it typical for the period was an exchange that occurred between halsey and one of his staff officers in june  south pacific command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive as a part of the long view of winning the war taken by nimitz upon its arrival at fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training south pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the solomon chain the staff officer who brought the dispatch to halsey remarked if they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive the admiral turned to the speaker and replied as long as i have one plane and one pilot i will stay on the offensive admiral halseys forces spent the rest of the year battling up the solomon islands chain to bougainville at bougainville the japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island and another at the northern most peninsula with a fourth on buki just across the northern passage here instead of landing near the japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the japanese defenders halsey landed his invasion force of  marines in empress augusta bay about halfway up the west coast of bougainville there he had the seabees clear and build their own airfield two days after the landing a large cruiser force was sent down from japan to rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against halseys screening force and supply ships in empress augusta bay the japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers along with one light cruiser and four destroyers at rabaul the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them the battleships washington south dakota and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the central pacific to support the upcoming invasion of tarawa other than the destroyer screen the only force halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on saratoga and princeton rabaul was a heavily fortified port with five airfields and extensive antiaircraft batteries other than the surprise raid at pearl harbor no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft it was highly dangerous to the aircrews and to the carriers as well with the landing in the balance halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of rabaul then launch a daybreak raid on the base aircraft from recently captured vella lavella were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers all available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself the mission was a stunning success so damaging the cruiser force at rabaul as to make them no longer a threat aircraft losses in the raid were light halsey later described the threat to the landings the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as comsopac following the successful bougainville operation he then isolated and neutralized the japanese naval stronghold at rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the bismarck archipelago in a series of amphibious landings known as operation cartwheel this enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself with the neutralization of rabaul major operations in the south pacific command came to a close with his determination and grit halsey had bolstered his commands resolve and seized the initiative from the japanese until ships aircraft and crews produced and trained in the states could arrive in  and  to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies battles of the central pacificedit adm halsey confers with task force  commander and fellow dirty trickster adm john s mccain sr on board halseys flagship the uss new jersey  as the war progressed it moved out of the south pacific and into the central pacific admiral halseys command shifted with it and in may  he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed third fleet he commanded actions from the philippines to japan from september  to january  he led the campaigns to take the palaus leyte and luzon and on many raids on japanese bases including off the shores of formosa china and vietnam by this point in the conflict the us navy was doing things the japanese high command had not thought possible the fast carrier task force was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in moreover the navys ability to establish forward operating ports as they did at majuro enewetak and ulithi and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western pacific the japanese navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy the us navy remained at sea and on station dominating whatever region it entered the size of the pacific ocean which japanese planners had thought would limit the us navys ability to operate in the western pacific would not be adequate to protect japan command of the big blue fleet was alternated with raymond spruancen  under spruance the fleet designation was the fifth fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  under halsey the fleet was designated third fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  the split command structure was intended to confuse the japanese and created a higher tempo of operations while spruance was at sea operating the fleet halsey and his staff selfdubbed the department of dirty tricks would be planning the next series of operations the two admirals were a contrast in styles halsey was aggressive and a risk taker spruance was calculating professional and cautious most higherranking officers preferred to serve under spruance most common sailors were proud to serve under halsey leyte gulfedit halsey dines with crew of uss new jersey november  in october  amphibious forces of the us seventh fleet carried out general douglas macarthurs major landings on the island of leyte in the central philippines halseys third fleet was assigned to cover and support seventh fleet operations around leyte halseys plans assumed the japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort creating an opportunity to engage it decisively halsey directed the third fleet will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces in response to the invasion the japanese launched their final major naval effort an operation known as shogo involving almost all their surviving fleet it was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the leyte gulf the northern force of admiral ozawa was built around the remaining japanese aircraft carriers now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots the northern force was meant to lure the covering us forces away from the gulf while two surface battlegroups the center force and the southern force were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping these forces were built around the remaining strength of the japanese navy and comprised a total of  battleships and  cruisers the operation brought about the battle for leyte gulf the largest naval battle of the second world war and by some criteria the largest naval battle in history the center force commanded by vice admiral takeo kurita was located october  coming through the palawan passage by two american submarines which attacked the force sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third the following day third fleets aircraft carriers launched strikes against kuritas center force sinking the battleship musashi and damaging the heavy cruiser myōkō causing the force to turn westward back towards its base kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the san bernardino strait at this point ozawas northern force was located by third fleet scout aircraft halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the japanese carrier forces planning to strike them at dawn of october  he considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait and made tentative plans to do so but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover weakening his chance to crush the remaining japanese carrier forces the entire third fleet steamed northward san bernardino strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet battle off samaredit in moving third fleet northwards halsey failed to advise admiral thomas kinkaid of seventh fleet of his decision seventh fleet intercepts of organizational messages from halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the san bernardino strait but this was not the case kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with halsey and neither had confirmed this with nimitz despite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of – october of kuritas center force in the san bernardino strait halsey continued to take third fleet northwards away from leyte gulf halsey with vice admiral john s mccain sr when kuritas center force emerged from the san bernardino strait on the morning of october  there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and destroyer escorts task unit  taffy  which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarinesclarification needed not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since midway led by the largest battleship in the world advancing down the coast of the island of samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the leyte gulf landing they took seventh fleets escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise in the desperate battle off samar which followed kuritas ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers screen and damaging a number of other ships as well the remarkable resistance of the screening ships of the escort carrier groups against kuritas battlegroup remains one of the most heroic feats in the storied history of the us navy their efforts and those of the aircraft that the escort carriers could put up took a heavy toll on kuritas ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case mistaking the escort carriers for halseys fleet carriers and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the third fleet battleship group he decided to withdraw back through the san bernardino strait and to the west without achieving his objective of the leyte landing when the seventh fleets escort carriers found themselves under attack from the center force halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off samar for over two hours halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls then shortly after  hours a message was received from admiral nimitz where is repeat where is task force  the world wonders the tail end of this message the world wonders was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to halsey the urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke the fiery halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing finally halseys chief of staff rear admiral robert mick carney confronted him telling halsey stop it what the hells the matter with you pull yourself together halsey cooled but continued to steam third fleet northward to close on ozawas northern force for a full hour after receiving the signal from nimitz then halsey ordered task force  south as task force  proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to  knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers the refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay by the time task force  arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the seventh fleets escort carrier groups kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area a single straggling destroyer was caught by halseys advance cruisers and destroyers but the rest of kuritas force was able to escape meanwhile the major part third fleet continued to close on ozawas northern force which included one fleet carrier the last surviving japanese carrier of the six that had attacked pearl harbor and three light carriers the battle of cape engaño resulted in halseys third fleet sinking all four of ozawas carriers the same attributes that made halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war his desire to bring the fight to the enemy his willingness to take on a gamble worked against him in the later stages of the war halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle with naval historian samuel morison terming the third fleet run to the north halseys blunder however the destruction of the japanese carriers had been the prime goal of pacific naval battles up to that point and the failure to pursue the japanese fleet carriers and destroy them had been a major criticism of spruance in some circles whose fifth fleet missed the opportunity at the battle of the philippine sean  halseys typhoonedit main article typhoon cobra  uss langley struggles in typhoon cobra after the leyte gulf engagement december found the third fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of typhoon cobra which was dubbed halseys typhoon by many while conducting operations off the philippines the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a pacific storm rather than move third fleet away halsey chose to remain on station for another day in fairness he received conflicting information from pearl harbor and his own staff the hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm which would have cleared task force  by some two hundred miles eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction however halsey played the odds declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of third fleet to hold formation on the evening of december  the combat air patrol over third fleet was unable to land their aircraft aboard the pitching and rolling carriers the pilots were forced to ditch in the ocean the aircraft were lost but all the pilots were picked up by escorting destroyers by  am the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously still the fleet attempted to maintain stations finally at  am halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them something which many ships had already been forced to do between  am and  pm the typhoon did its worst damage tossing the ships in seventyfoot waves the barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at eightythree knots with gusts well over  knots at  pm halsey issued a typhoon warning to fleet weather central by this time the third fleet had already lost three destroyers the storm inflicted damage on a great many ships in the fleet with the loss of some  men and  aircraft third fleet conducted search and rescue operations for three days following the storm finally retiring for repairs at ulithi on december  following the typhoon a navy court of inquiry was convened on board the uss cascade ad in the naval base at ulithi admiral nimitz cincpac was in attendance at the court fortythreeyearold captain herbert k gates of the cascade was the judge advocate the inquiry found that though halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the third fleet into the heart of the typhoon it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction the events surrounding typhoon cobra were similar to those the japanese navy itself faced some nine years earlier in what they termed the fourth fleet incident end of the waredit fleet admiral nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board uss missouri behind him stand gen douglas macarthur adm william halsey and rear adm forrest sherman during january  the third fleet attacked formosa and luzon and raided the south china sea in support of the landing of us army forces on luzon at the conclusion of this operation halsey passed command of the ships that made up third fleet to admiral spruance on  january whereupon its designation changed to fifth fleet returning home halsey was asked about general macarthur general macarthur was not the easiest man to work with and vied with the navy over the conduct and management of the war in the pacific halsey had worked well with macarthur and did not mind saying so when a reporter asked halsey if he thought general macarthurs fleet th fleet would get to tokyo first the admiral grinned and answered were going there together then seriously he added hes a very fine man i have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him spruance held command of th fleet until may when command returned to halsey in early june  rd fleet again sailed through the path of typhoon connie on this occasion six men were swept overboard and lost along with  airplanes lost or destroyed with another  badly damaged though some ships sustained significant damage none were lost a navy court of inquiry was again convened this time recommending that halsey be reassigned but admiral nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation citing halseys prior service record halsey led third fleet through the final stages of the war striking targets on the japanese homeland itself third fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon tokyo the naval base at kure and the northern japanese island of hokkaidō and third fleet battleships engaged in the bombardment of a number of japanese coastal cities in preparation for an invasion of japan which ultimately never had to be undertaken after the cessation of hostilities halsey still aggressively cautious of japanese kamikaze attacks ordered third fleet to maintain a protective air cover with the following communiqué cessation of hostilities war is over if any japanese airplanes appear shoot them down in a friendly way he was present when japan formally surrendered on the deck of his flagship uss missouri on september   postwar yearsedit halsey immediately after the surrender of japan  ships of the third fleet returned to

senator rufus king who was an american lawyer politician diplomat and federalist halsey attended the pingry school after waiting two years to receive an appointment to the united states naval academy halsey decided to study medicine at the university of virginia and then join the navy as a physician he chose virginia because his best friend karl osterhause was there while there halsey joined the delta psi fraternity and was also a member of the secretive seven society after his first year halsey received his appointment to the united states naval academy at annapolis and entered the academy in the fall of  while attending the academy he lettered in football as a fullback and earned several athletic honors halsey graduated from the naval academy on february   following graduation he spent his early service years in battleships and sailed with the main battle fleet aboard the battleship uss kansas bb as roosevelts great white fleet circumnavigated the globe from  to  halsey was on the bridge of the battleship uss missouri on wednesday april   when a flareback from the port gun in her after turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others no explosion occurred but the rapid burning of the powder burnt and suffocated to death  officers and men this resulted in halsey dreading the th of every month especially when it fell on a friday after his service on the missouri halsey served aboard torpedo boats beginning with uss du pont in  halsey was one of the few officers who was promoted directly from ensign to full lieutenant skipping the rank of lieutenant junior grade torpedoes and torpedo boats became specialties of his and he commanded the first group of the atlantic fleets torpedo flotilla in  through  halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and destroyers during the s and s at that time the destroyer and the torpedo boat though extremely hazardous delivery methods were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships lieutenant commander halseys world war i service including command of uss shaw in  earned him the navy cross interwar yearsedit in october  he was the naval attaché at the american embassy in berlin germany one year later he was given additional duty as naval attaché at the american embassies in christiania norway copenhagen denmark and stockholm sweden he then returned to sea duty again in destroyers in european waters in command of uss dale and uss osborne upon his return to the us in  he served one year as executive officer of the battleship uss wyoming and then for three years in command of uss reina mercedes the station ship at the naval academy captain halsey continued his destroyer duty on his next twoyear stint at sea starting in  as commander destroyer division three of the scouting force before returning to study at the naval war college in newport rhode island in  the chief of the bureau of aeronautics navy admiral ernest king offered halsey command of the aircraft carrier uss saratoga subject to completion of the course of an air observer captain halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full week naval aviator course rather than the simpler naval aviation observer program i thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot halsey earned his naval aviators wings on may   at the age of  the oldest person to do so in the history of the us navy while he had approval from his wife to train as an observer she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training and she told her daughter what do you think that the old fool is doing now hes learning to fly he went on to command the saratoga and later the naval air station pensacola at pensacola florida halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy commenting the naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation and good captain halsey was promoted to rear admiral in  during this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the aircraft battle force world war iiedit traditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines this view was challenged when army airman general billy mitchell demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel in the interwar debate that followed some saw the carrier as defensive in nature providing air cover to protect the battle group from shorebased aircraft carrierbased aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal the adage capital ships cannot withstand landbased air power was well known aviation proponents however imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system when he testified at admiral husband kimmels hearing after the pearl harbor debacle he summed up american carrier tactics being to get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon in april  halseys ships as part of battle fleet moved to hawaii and in june  he was promoted to vice admiral temporary rank appointed commander carrier division  and commander aircraft battle force with tensions high and war imminent us naval intelligence indicated wake island would be the target of a japanese surprise attack in response on  november  admiral kimmel ordered halsey to take uss enterprise to ferry aircraft to wake island to reinforce the marines there kimmel had given halsey a free hand to attack and destroy any japanese military forces encountered the planes flew off her deck on december  highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the japanese carrier force halsey gave orders to sink any shipping sighted shoot down any plane encountered protested his operations officer goddammit admiral you cant start a private war of your own whos going to take the responsibility said halsey ill take it if anything gets in my way well shoot first and argue afterwards a storm delayed enterprise on her return voyage to hawaii instead of returning on december  as planned she was still  miles out at sea when she received word that the surprise attack anticipated was not at wake island but at pearl harbor itself news of the attack came in the form of overhearing desperate radio transmissions from one of her aircraft sent forward to pearl harbor attempting to identify itself as american the plane was shot down and her pilot and crew were lost in the immediate wake of the attack upon pearl harbor admiral kimmel named halsey commander of all the ships at sea enterprise searched south and west of the hawaiian islands for the japanese attackers but did not locate the six japanese fleet carriers then retiring to the north and west early pacific carrier raidsedit an sbd dauntless flies antisubmarine patrol over enterprise and saratoga vice admiral halsey and enterprise slipped back into pearl harbor on the evening of december  surveying the wreckage of the pacific fleet he remarked before were through with them the japanese language will be spoken only in hell halsey was an aggressive commander above all else he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the us navys fighting spirit when most required in the early months of the war as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy serving as commander carrier division  aboard his flagship enterprise halsey led a series of hitandrun raids against the japanese striking the gilbert and marshall islands in february wake island in march and carrying out the doolittle raid in april  against the japanese capital tokyo and other places on japans largest and most populous island honshu the first air raid to strike the japanese home islands providing an important boost to american morale halseys slogan hit hard hit fast hit often soon became a byword for the navy halsey returned to pearl harbor from his last raid on may   in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand he had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier enterprise directing the navys counterstrikes a debilitating chronic skin condition covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching making it nearly impossible for him to sleep gaunt and having lost twenty pounds he was medically ordered to the hospital in hawaii meanwhile us naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the japanese were planning an attack on the central pacific island of midway admiral chester nimitz commander in chief us pacific fleet determined to take the opportunity to engage them losing midway would have been a very serious threat because the japanese then could easily take hawaii and threaten the west coast of the united states the loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral halsey on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to nimitz nimitz met with halsey who recommended his cruiser division commander rear admiral raymond spruance to take command for the upcoming midway operation nimitz considered the move but it would mean stepping over rear admiral frank fletcher of task force  who was the senior of the two men after interviewing fletcher and reviewing his reports from the coral sea engagement nimitz was convinced that fletchers performance was sound and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of midway acting upon halseys recommendations nimitz then made rear admiral spruance commander of halseys task force  comprising the carriers enterprise and hornet to aid spruance who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff captain miles browning the ensuing harrowing battle of midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the united states and a dramatic victory for the us navy halseys skin condition was so serious he was sent on the light cruiser uss detroit to san francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment the skin condition soon receded but halsey was ordered to stand down for the next  weeks and relax while detached stateside during his convalescence he visited family and travelled to washington dc in late august he accepted a speaking engagement at the us naval academy at annapolis prior to the discussion of his raids against the japanese positions in the marshall islands halsey informed the midshipmen before him missing the battle of midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career but i am going back to the pacific where i intend personally to have a crack at those yellowbellied sons of bitches and their carriers which was received with loud applause at the completion of his convalescence in september  admiral nimitz reassigned halsey to commander air force pacific fleet south pacific area commandedit halsey in the south pacific after being medically approved to return to duty halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the south pacific area since enterprise was still laid up in pearl harbor undergoing repairs following the battle of the eastern solomons and the other ships of task force  were still being readied he began a familiarization trip to the south pacific on october   arriving at area headquarters at nouméa in new caledonia on the th the guadalcanal campaign was at a critical juncture with the st marine division  men under the combat command of marine major general alexander a vandergrift holding on by a thread around henderson air field the marines did receive additional support from the us armys th regiment with a complement of  soldiers on october  this addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself during this critical juncture naval support was tenuous due to vice admiral robert l ghormleys reticence malaise and lackluster performance pacific fleet commander chester nimitz had concluded that vice admiral ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted nimitz made his decision to change the south pacific area command while halsey was en route as halseys aircraft came to rest in nouméa a whaleboat came alongside carrying ghormleys flag lieutenant meeting him before he could board the flagship the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from nimitz you will take command of the south pacific area and south pacific forces immediately the order came as an awkward surprise to halsey ghormley was a long time personal friend and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at annapolis awkward or not the two men carried out their directives halseys command now included all ground sea and air forces in the south pacific area news of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered marines energizing his command he was widely considered the us navys most aggressive admiral and with good reason he set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed ghormley had been unsure of his commands ability to maintain the marine toehold on guadalcanal and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the bataan peninsula disaster halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the marines he not only intended to counter the japanese efforts to dislodge them he intended to secure the island above all else he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the japanese it was two days after halsey had taken command in october  that he gave an order that all naval officers in the south pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms as richard frank commented in his account of the battle for guadalcanal halsey said he gave this order to conform to army practice and for comfort to his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war halsey led the south pacific command through what was for the us navy the most tenuous phase of the war halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around guadalcanal including the carrier engagements of the battle of the santa cruz islands and the naval battle of guadalcanal these engagements checked the japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots admirals nimitz and halsey discuss south pacific strategy in early  in november halseys willingness to place at risk his commands two fast battleships in the confined waters around guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the us navy winning the naval battle of guadalcanal the decisive naval engagement of the guadalcanal campaign that doomed the japanese garrison and wrested control from the japanese the solomons campaign ended up being a meat grinder of ijn aviation in april  halsey assigned admiral marc mitscher to commander air solomon islands comairsols where he directed a mixed bag of army navy marine and new zealand aircraft in the airwar over guadalcanal and up the solomon chain said halsey i knew wed probably catch hell from the japs in the air thats why i sent pete mitscher up there pete was a fighting fool and i knew it typical for the period was an exchange that occurred between halsey and one of his staff officers in june  south pacific command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive as a part of the long view of winning the war taken by nimitz upon its arrival at fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training south pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the solomon chain the staff officer who brought the dispatch to halsey remarked if they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive the admiral turned to the speaker and replied as long as i have one plane and one pilot i will stay on the offensive admiral halseys forces spent the rest of the year battling up the solomon islands chain to bougainville at bougainville the japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island and another at the northern most peninsula with a fourth on buki just across the northern passage here instead of landing near the japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the japanese defenders halsey landed his invasion force of  marines in empress augusta bay about halfway up the west coast of bougainville there he had the seabees clear and build their own airfield two days after the landing a large cruiser force was sent down from japan to rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against halseys screening force and supply ships in empress augusta bay the japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers along with one light cruiser and four destroyers at rabaul the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them the battleships washington south dakota and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the central pacific to support the upcoming invasion of tarawa other than the destroyer screen the only force halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on saratoga and princeton rabaul was a heavily fortified port with five airfields and extensive antiaircraft batteries other than the surprise raid at pearl harbor no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft it was highly dangerous to the aircrews and to the carriers as well with the landing in the balance halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of rabaul then launch a daybreak raid on the base aircraft from recently captured vella lavella were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers all available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself the mission was a stunning success so damaging the cruiser force at rabaul as to make them no longer a threat aircraft losses in the raid were light halsey later described the threat to the landings the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as comsopac following the successful bougainville operation he then isolated and neutralized the japanese naval stronghold at rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the bismarck archipelago in a series of amphibious landings known as operation cartwheel this enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself with the neutralization of rabaul major operations in the south pacific command came to a close with his determination and grit halsey had bolstered his commands resolve and seized the initiative from the japanese until ships aircraft and crews produced and trained in the states could arrive in  and  to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies battles of the central pacificedit adm halsey confers with task force  commander and fellow dirty trickster adm john s mccain sr on board halseys flagship the uss new jersey  as the war progressed it moved out of the south pacific and into the central pacific admiral halseys command shifted with it and in may  he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed third fleet he commanded actions from the philippines to japan from september  to january  he led the campaigns to take the palaus leyte and luzon and on many raids on japanese bases including off the shores of formosa china and vietnam by this point in the conflict the us navy was doing things the japanese high command had not thought possible the fast carrier task force was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in moreover the navys ability to establish forward operating ports as they did at majuro enewetak and ulithi and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western pacific the japanese navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy the us navy remained at sea and on station dominating whatever region it entered the size of the pacific ocean which japanese planners had thought would limit the us navys ability to operate in the western pacific would not be adequate to protect japan command of the big blue fleet was alternated with raymond spruancen  under spruance the fleet designation was the fifth fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  under halsey the fleet was designated third fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  the split command structure was intended to confuse the japanese and created a higher tempo of operations while spruance was at sea operating the fleet halsey and his staff selfdubbed the department of dirty tricks would be planning the next series of operations the two admirals were a contrast in styles halsey was aggressive and a risk taker spruance was calculating professional and cautious most higherranking officers preferred to serve under spruance most common sailors were proud to serve under halsey leyte gulfedit halsey dines with crew of uss new jersey november  in october  amphibious forces of the us seventh fleet carried out general douglas macarthurs major landings on the island of leyte in the central philippines halseys third fleet was assigned to cover and support seventh fleet operations around leyte halseys plans assumed the japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort creating an opportunity to engage it decisively halsey directed the third fleet will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces in response to the invasion the japanese launched their final major naval effort an operation known as shogo involving almost all their surviving fleet it was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the leyte gulf the northern force of admiral ozawa was built around the remaining japanese aircraft carriers now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots the northern force was meant to lure the covering us forces away from the gulf while two surface battlegroups the center force and the southern force were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping these forces were built around the remaining strength of the japanese navy and comprised a total of  battleships and  cruisers the operation brought about the battle for leyte gulf the largest naval battle of the second world war and by some criteria the largest naval battle in history the center force commanded by vice admiral takeo kurita was located october  coming through the palawan passage by two american submarines which attacked the force sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third the following day third fleets aircraft carriers launched strikes against kuritas center force sinking the battleship musashi and damaging the heavy cruiser myōkō causing the force to turn westward back towards its base kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the san bernardino strait at this point ozawas northern force was located by third fleet scout aircraft halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the japanese carrier forces planning to strike them at dawn of october  he considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait and made tentative plans to do so but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover weakening his chance to crush the remaining japanese carrier forces the entire third fleet steamed northward san bernardino strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet battle off samaredit in moving third fleet northwards halsey failed to advise admiral thomas kinkaid of seventh fleet of his decision seventh fleet intercepts of organizational messages from halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the san bernardino strait but this was not the case kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with halsey and neither had confirmed this with nimitz despite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of – october of kuritas center force in the san bernardino strait halsey continued to take third fleet northwards away from leyte gulf halsey with vice admiral john s mccain sr when kuritas center force emerged from the san bernardino strait on the morning of october  there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and destroyer escorts task unit  taffy  which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarinesclarification needed not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since midway led by the largest battleship in the world advancing down the coast of the island of samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the leyte gulf landing they took seventh fleets escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise in the desperate battle off samar which followed kuritas ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers screen and damaging a number of other ships as well the remarkable resistance of the screening ships of the escort carrier groups against kuritas battlegroup remains one of the most heroic feats in the storied history of the us navy their efforts and those of the aircraft that the escort carriers could put up took a heavy toll on kuritas ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case mistaking the escort carriers for halseys fleet carriers and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the third fleet battleship group he decided to withdraw back through the san bernardino strait and to the west without achieving his objective of the leyte landing when the seventh fleets escort carriers found themselves under attack from the center force halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off samar for over two hours halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls then shortly after  hours a message was received from admiral nimitz where is repeat where is task force  the world wonders the tail end of this message the world wonders was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to halsey the urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke the fiery halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing finally halseys chief of staff rear admiral robert mick carney confronted him telling halsey stop it what the hells the matter with you pull yourself together halsey cooled but continued to steam third fleet northward to close on ozawas northern force for a full hour after receiving the signal from nimitz then halsey ordered task force  south as task force  proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to  knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers the refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay by the time task force  arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the seventh fleets escort carrier groups kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area a single straggling destroyer was caught by halseys advance cruisers and destroyers but the rest of kuritas force was able to escape meanwhile the major part third fleet continued to close on ozawas northern force which included one fleet carrier the last surviving japanese carrier of the six that had attacked pearl harbor and three light carriers the battle of cape engaño resulted in halseys third fleet sinking all four of ozawas carriers the same attributes that made halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war his desire to bring the fight to the enemy his willingness to take on a gamble worked against him in the later stages of the war halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle with naval historian samuel morison terming the third fleet run to the north halseys blunder however the destruction of the japanese carriers had been the prime goal of pacific naval battles up to that point and the failure to pursue the japanese fleet carriers and destroy them had been a major criticism of spruance in some circles whose fifth fleet missed the opportunity at the battle of the philippine sean  halseys typhoonedit main article typhoon cobra  uss langley struggles in typhoon cobra after the leyte gulf engagement december found the third fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of typhoon cobra which was dubbed halseys typhoon by many while conducting operations off the philippines the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a pacific storm rather than move third fleet away halsey chose to remain on station for another day in fairness he received conflicting information from pearl harbor and his own staff the hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm which would have cleared task force  by some two hundred miles eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction however halsey played the odds declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of third fleet to hold formation on the evening of december  the combat air patrol over third fleet was unable to land their aircraft aboard the pitching and rolling carriers the pilots were forced to ditch in the ocean the aircraft were lost but all the pilots were picked up by escorting destroyers by  am the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously still the fleet attempted to maintain stations finally at  am halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them something which many ships had already been forced to do between  am and  pm the typhoon did its worst damage tossing the ships in seventyfoot waves the barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at eightythree knots with gusts well over  knots at  pm halsey issued a typhoon warning to fleet weather central by this time the third fleet had already lost three destroyers the storm inflicted damage on a great many ships in the fleet with the loss of some  men and  aircraft third fleet conducted search and rescue operations for three days following the storm finally retiring for repairs at ulithi on december  following the typhoon a navy court of inquiry was convened on board the uss cascade ad in the naval base at ulithi admiral nimitz cincpac was in attendance at the court fortythreeyearold captain herbert k gates of the cascade was the judge advocate the inquiry found that though halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the third fleet into the heart of the typhoon it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction the events surrounding typhoon cobra were similar to those the japanese navy itself faced some nine years earlier in what they termed the fourth fleet incident end of the waredit fleet admiral nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board uss missouri behind him stand gen douglas macarthur adm william halsey and rear adm forrest sherman during january  the third fleet attacked formosa and luzon and raided the south china sea in support of the landing of us army forces on luzon at the conclusion of this operation halsey passed command of the ships that made up third fleet to admiral spruance on  january whereupon its designation changed to fifth fleet returning home halsey was asked about general macarthur general macarthur was not the easiest man to work with and vied with the navy over the conduct and management of the war in the pacific halsey had worked well with macarthur and did not mind saying so when a reporter asked halsey if he thought general macarthurs fleet th fleet would get to tokyo first the admiral grinned and answered were going there together then seriously he added hes a very fine man i have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him spruance held command of th fleet until may when command returned to halsey in early june  rd fleet again sailed through the path of typhoon connie on this occasion six men were swept overboard and lost along with  airplanes lost or destroyed with another  badly damaged though some ships sustained significant damage none were lost a navy court of inquiry was again convened this time recommending that halsey be reassigned but admiral nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation citing halseys prior service record halsey led third fleet through the final stages of the war striking targets on the japanese homeland itself third fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon tokyo the naval base at kure and the northern japanese island of hokkaidō and third fleet battleships engaged in the bombardment of a number of japanese coastal cities in preparation for an invasion of japan which ultimately never had to be undertaken after the cessation of hostilities halsey still aggressively cautious of japanese kamikaze attacks ordered third fleet to maintain a protective air cover with the following communiqué cessation of hostilities war is over if any japanese airplanes appear shoot them down in a friendly way he was present when japan formally surrendered on the deck of his flagship uss missouri on september   postwar yearsedit halsey immediately after the surrender of japan  ships of the third fleet returned to

was interred on august   near his parents in arlington national cemetery his wife frances grandy halsey is buried with him asked about his contribution in the pacific and the role he played in defending the united states halsey said merely there are no great men just great challenges which ordinary men out of necessity are forced by circumstances to meet personal lifeedit while at the university of virginia he met frances cooke grandy – of norfolk virginia who halsey called fan after his return from the great white fleets circumnavigation of the globe and upon his promotion to the rank of full lieutenant he was able to persuade her to marry him they married on december   at christ church in norfolk among the ushers were halseys friends thomas c hart and husband e kimmel fan

politician diplomat and federalist halsey attended the pingry school after waiting two years to receive an appointment to the united states naval academy halsey decided to study medicine at the university of virginia and then join the navy as a physician he chose virginia because his best friend karl osterhause was there while there halsey joined the delta psi fraternity and was also a member of the secretive seven society after his first year halsey received his appointment to the united states naval academy at annapolis and entered the academy in the fall of  while attending the academy he lettered in football as a fullback and earned several athletic honors halsey graduated from the naval academy on february   following graduation he spent his early service years in battleships and sailed with the main battle fleet aboard the battleship uss kansas bb as roosevelts great white fleet circumnavigated the globe from  to  halsey was on the bridge of the battleship uss missouri on wednesday april   when a flareback from the port gun in her after turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others no explosion occurred but the rapid burning of the powder burnt and suffocated to death  officers and men this resulted in halsey dreading the th of every month especially when it fell on a friday after his service on the missouri halsey served aboard torpedo boats beginning with uss du pont in  halsey was one of the few officers who was promoted directly from ensign to full lieutenant skipping the rank of lieutenant junior grade torpedoes and torpedo boats became specialties of his and he commanded the first group of the atlantic fleets torpedo flotilla in  through  halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and destroyers during the s and s at that time the destroyer and the torpedo boat though extremely hazardous delivery methods were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships lieutenant commander halseys world war i service including command of uss shaw in  earned him the navy cross interwar yearsedit in october  he was the naval attaché at the american embassy in berlin germany one year later he was given additional duty as naval attaché at the american embassies in christiania norway copenhagen denmark and stockholm sweden he then returned to sea duty again in destroyers in european waters in command of uss dale and uss osborne upon his return to the us in  he served one year as executive officer of the battleship uss wyoming and then for three years in command of uss reina mercedes the station ship at the naval academy captain halsey continued his destroyer duty on his next twoyear stint at sea starting in  as commander destroyer division three of the scouting force before returning to study at the naval war college in newport rhode island in  the chief of the bureau of aeronautics navy admiral ernest king offered halsey command of the aircraft carrier uss saratoga subject to completion of the course of an air observer captain halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full week naval aviator course rather than the simpler naval aviation observer program i thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot halsey earned his naval aviators wings on may   at the age of  the oldest person to do so in the history of the us navy while he had approval from his wife to train as an observer she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training and she told her daughter what do you think that the old fool is doing now hes learning to fly he went on to command the saratoga and later the naval air station pensacola at pensacola florida halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy commenting the naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation and good captain halsey was promoted to rear admiral in  during this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the aircraft battle force world war iiedit traditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines this view was challenged when army airman general billy mitchell demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel in the interwar debate that followed some saw the carrier as defensive in nature providing air cover to protect the battle group from shorebased aircraft carrierbased aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal the adage capital ships cannot withstand landbased air power was well known aviation proponents however imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system when he testified at admiral husband kimmels hearing after the pearl harbor debacle he summed up american carrier tactics being to get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon in april  halseys ships as part of battle fleet moved to hawaii and in june  he was promoted to vice admiral temporary rank appointed commander carrier division  and commander aircraft battle force with tensions high and war imminent us naval intelligence indicated wake island would be the target of a japanese surprise attack in response on  november  admiral kimmel ordered halsey to take uss enterprise to ferry aircraft to wake island to reinforce the marines there kimmel had given halsey a free hand to attack and destroy any japanese military forces encountered the planes flew off her deck on december  highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the japanese carrier force halsey gave orders to sink any shipping sighted shoot down any plane encountered protested his operations officer goddammit admiral you cant start a private war of your own whos going to take the responsibility said halsey ill take it if anything gets in my way well shoot first and argue afterwards a storm delayed enterprise on her return voyage to hawaii instead of returning on december  as planned she was still  miles out at sea when she received word that the surprise attack anticipated was not at wake island but at pearl harbor itself news of the attack came in the form of overhearing desperate radio transmissions from one of her aircraft sent forward to pearl harbor attempting to identify itself as american the plane was shot down and her pilot and crew were lost in the immediate wake of the attack upon pearl harbor admiral kimmel named halsey commander of all the ships at sea enterprise searched south and west of the hawaiian islands for the japanese attackers but did not locate the six japanese fleet carriers then retiring to the north and west early pacific carrier raidsedit an sbd dauntless flies antisubmarine patrol over enterprise and saratoga vice admiral halsey and enterprise slipped back into pearl harbor on the evening of december  surveying the wreckage of the pacific fleet he remarked before were through with them the japanese language will be spoken only in hell halsey was an aggressive commander above all else he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the us navys fighting spirit when most required in the early months of the war as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy serving as commander carrier division  aboard his flagship enterprise halsey led a series of hitandrun raids against the japanese striking the gilbert and marshall islands in february wake island in march and carrying out the doolittle raid in april  against the japanese capital tokyo and other places on japans largest and most populous island honshu the first air raid to strike the japanese home islands providing an important boost to american morale halseys slogan hit hard hit fast hit often soon became a byword for the navy halsey returned to pearl harbor from his last raid on may   in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand he had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier enterprise directing the navys counterstrikes a debilitating chronic skin condition covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching making it nearly impossible for him to sleep gaunt and having lost twenty pounds he was medically ordered to the hospital in hawaii meanwhile us naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the japanese were planning an attack on the central pacific island of midway admiral chester nimitz commander in chief us pacific fleet determined to take the opportunity to engage them losing midway would have been a very serious threat because the japanese then could easily take hawaii and threaten the west coast of the united states the loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral halsey on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to nimitz nimitz met with halsey who recommended his cruiser division commander rear admiral raymond spruance to take command for the upcoming midway operation nimitz considered the move but it would mean stepping over rear admiral frank fletcher of task force  who was the senior of the two men after interviewing fletcher and reviewing his reports from the coral sea engagement nimitz was convinced that fletchers performance was sound and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of midway acting upon halseys recommendations nimitz then made rear admiral spruance commander of halseys task force  comprising the carriers enterprise and hornet to aid spruance who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff captain miles browning the ensuing harrowing battle of midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the united states and a dramatic victory for the us navy halseys skin condition was so serious he was sent on the light cruiser uss detroit to san francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment the skin condition soon receded but halsey was ordered to stand down for the next  weeks and relax while detached stateside during his convalescence he visited family and travelled to washington dc in late august he accepted a speaking engagement at the us naval academy at annapolis prior to the discussion of his raids against the japanese positions in the marshall islands halsey informed the midshipmen before him missing the battle of midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career but i am going back to the pacific where i intend personally to have a crack at those yellowbellied sons of bitches and their carriers which was received with loud applause at the completion of his convalescence in september  admiral nimitz reassigned halsey to commander air force pacific fleet south pacific area commandedit halsey in the south pacific after being medically approved to return to duty halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the south pacific area since enterprise was still laid up in pearl harbor undergoing repairs following the battle of the eastern solomons and the other ships of task force  were still being readied he began a familiarization trip to the south pacific on october   arriving at area headquarters at nouméa in new caledonia on the th the guadalcanal campaign was at a critical juncture with the st marine division  men under the combat command of marine major general alexander a vandergrift holding on by a thread around henderson air field the marines did receive additional support from the us armys th regiment with a complement of  soldiers on october  this addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself during this critical juncture naval support was tenuous due to vice admiral robert l ghormleys reticence malaise and lackluster performance pacific fleet commander chester nimitz had concluded that vice admiral ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted nimitz made his decision to change the south pacific area command while halsey was en route as halseys aircraft came to rest in nouméa a whaleboat came alongside carrying ghormleys flag lieutenant meeting him before he could board the flagship the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from nimitz you will take command of the south pacific area and south pacific forces immediately the order came as an awkward surprise to halsey ghormley was a long time personal friend and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at annapolis awkward or not the two men carried out their directives halseys command now included all ground sea and air forces in the south pacific area news of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered marines energizing his command he was widely considered the us navys most aggressive admiral and with good reason he set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed ghormley had been unsure of his commands ability to maintain the marine toehold on guadalcanal and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the bataan peninsula disaster halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the marines he not only intended to counter the japanese efforts to dislodge them he intended to secure the island above all else he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the japanese it was two days after halsey had taken command in october  that he gave an order that all naval officers in the south pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms as richard frank commented in his account of the battle for guadalcanal halsey said he gave this order to conform to army practice and for comfort to his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war halsey led the south pacific command through what was for the us navy the most tenuous phase of the war halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around guadalcanal including the carrier engagements of the battle of the santa cruz islands and the naval battle of guadalcanal these engagements checked the japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots admirals nimitz and halsey discuss south pacific strategy in early  in november halseys willingness to place at risk his commands two fast battleships in the confined waters around guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the us navy winning the naval battle of guadalcanal the decisive naval engagement of the guadalcanal campaign that doomed the japanese garrison and wrested control from the japanese the solomons campaign ended up being a meat grinder of ijn aviation in april  halsey assigned admiral marc mitscher to commander air solomon islands comairsols where he directed a mixed bag of army navy marine and new zealand aircraft in the airwar over guadalcanal and up the solomon chain said halsey i knew wed probably catch hell from the japs in the air thats why i sent pete mitscher up there pete was a fighting fool and i knew it typical for the period was an exchange that occurred between halsey and one of his staff officers in june  south pacific command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive as a part of the long view of winning the war taken by nimitz upon its arrival at fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training south pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the solomon chain the staff officer who brought the dispatch to halsey remarked if they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive the admiral turned to the speaker and replied as long as i have one plane and one pilot i will stay on the offensive admiral halseys forces spent the rest of the year battling up the solomon islands chain to bougainville at bougainville the japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island and another at the northern most peninsula with a fourth on buki just across the northern passage here instead of landing near the japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the japanese defenders halsey landed his invasion force of  marines in empress augusta bay about halfway up the west coast of bougainville there he had the seabees clear and build their own airfield two days after the landing a large cruiser force was sent down from japan to rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against halseys screening force and supply ships in empress augusta bay the japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers along with one light cruiser and four destroyers at rabaul the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them the battleships washington south dakota and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the central pacific to support the upcoming invasion of tarawa other than the destroyer screen the only force halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on saratoga and princeton rabaul was a heavily fortified port with five airfields and extensive antiaircraft batteries other than the surprise raid at pearl harbor no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft it was highly dangerous to the aircrews and to the carriers as well with the landing in the balance halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of rabaul then launch a daybreak raid on the base aircraft from recently captured vella lavella were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers all available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself the mission was a stunning success so damaging the cruiser force at rabaul as to make them no longer a threat aircraft losses in the raid were light halsey later described the threat to the landings the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as comsopac following the successful bougainville operation he then isolated and neutralized the japanese naval stronghold at rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the bismarck archipelago in a series of amphibious landings known as operation cartwheel this enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself with the neutralization of rabaul major operations in the south pacific command came to a close with his determination and grit halsey had bolstered his commands resolve and seized the initiative from the japanese until ships aircraft and crews produced and trained in the states could arrive in  and  to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies battles of the central pacificedit adm halsey confers with task force  commander and fellow dirty trickster adm john s mccain sr on board halseys flagship the uss new jersey  as the war progressed it moved out of the south pacific and into the central pacific admiral halseys command shifted with it and in may  he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed third fleet he commanded actions from the philippines to japan from september  to january  he led the campaigns to take the palaus leyte and luzon and on many raids on japanese bases including off the shores of formosa china and vietnam by this point in the conflict the us navy was doing things the japanese high command had not thought possible the fast carrier task force was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in moreover the navys ability to establish forward operating ports as they did at majuro enewetak and ulithi and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western pacific the japanese navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy the us navy remained at sea and on station dominating whatever region it entered the size of the pacific ocean which japanese planners had thought would limit the us navys ability to operate in the western pacific would not be adequate to protect japan command of the big blue fleet was alternated with raymond spruancen  under spruance the fleet designation was the fifth fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  under halsey the fleet was designated third fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  the split command structure was intended to confuse the japanese and created a higher tempo of operations while spruance was at sea operating the fleet halsey and his staff selfdubbed the department of dirty tricks would be planning the next series of operations the two admirals were a contrast in styles halsey was aggressive and a risk taker spruance was calculating professional and cautious most higherranking officers preferred to serve under spruance most common sailors were proud to serve under halsey leyte gulfedit halsey dines with crew of uss new jersey november  in october  amphibious forces of the us seventh fleet carried out general douglas macarthurs major landings on the island of leyte in the central philippines halseys third fleet was assigned to cover and support seventh fleet operations around leyte halseys plans assumed the japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort creating an opportunity to engage it decisively halsey directed the third fleet will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces in response to the invasion the japanese launched their final major naval effort an operation known as shogo involving almost all their surviving fleet it was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the leyte gulf the northern force of admiral ozawa was built around the remaining japanese aircraft carriers now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots the northern force was meant to lure the covering us forces away from the gulf while two surface battlegroups the center force and the southern force were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping these forces were built around the remaining strength of the japanese navy and comprised a total of  battleships and  cruisers the operation brought about the battle for leyte gulf the largest naval battle of the second world war and by some criteria the largest naval battle in history the center force commanded by vice admiral takeo kurita was located october  coming through the palawan passage by two american submarines which attacked the force sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third the following day third fleets aircraft carriers launched strikes against kuritas center force sinking the battleship musashi and damaging the heavy cruiser myōkō causing the force to turn westward back towards its base kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the san bernardino strait at this point ozawas northern force was located by third fleet scout aircraft halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the japanese carrier forces planning to strike them at dawn of october  he considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait and made tentative plans to do so but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover weakening his chance to crush the remaining japanese carrier forces the entire third fleet steamed northward san bernardino strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet battle off samaredit in moving third fleet northwards halsey failed to advise admiral thomas kinkaid of seventh fleet of his decision seventh fleet intercepts of organizational messages from halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the san bernardino strait but this was not the case kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with halsey and neither had confirmed this with nimitz despite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of – october of kuritas center force in the san bernardino strait halsey continued to take third fleet northwards away from leyte gulf halsey with vice admiral john s mccain sr when kuritas center force emerged from the san bernardino strait on the morning of october  there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and destroyer escorts task unit  taffy  which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarinesclarification needed not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since midway led by the largest battleship in the world advancing down the coast of the island of samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the leyte gulf landing they took seventh fleets escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise in the desperate battle off samar which followed kuritas ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers screen and damaging a number of other ships as well the remarkable resistance of the screening ships of the escort carrier groups against kuritas battlegroup remains one of the most heroic feats in the storied history of the us navy their efforts and those of the aircraft that the escort carriers could put up took a heavy toll on kuritas ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case mistaking the escort carriers for halseys fleet carriers and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the third fleet battleship group he decided to withdraw back through the san bernardino strait and to the west without achieving his objective of the leyte landing when the seventh fleets escort carriers found themselves under attack from the center force halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off samar for over two hours halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls then shortly after  hours a message was received from admiral nimitz where is repeat where is task force  the world wonders the tail end of this message the world wonders was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to halsey the urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke the fiery halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing finally halseys chief of staff rear admiral robert mick carney confronted him telling halsey stop it what the hells the matter with you pull yourself together halsey cooled but continued to steam third fleet northward to close on ozawas northern force for a full hour after receiving the signal from nimitz then halsey ordered task force  south as task force  proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to  knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers the refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay by the time task force  arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the seventh fleets escort carrier groups kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area a single straggling destroyer was caught by halseys advance cruisers and destroyers but the rest of kuritas force was able to escape meanwhile the major part third fleet continued to close on ozawas northern force which included one fleet carrier the last surviving japanese carrier of the six that had attacked pearl harbor and three light carriers the battle of cape engaño resulted in halseys third fleet sinking all four of ozawas carriers the same attributes that made halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war his desire to bring the fight to the enemy his willingness to take on a gamble worked against him in the later stages of the war halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle with naval historian samuel morison terming the third fleet run to the north halseys blunder however the destruction of the japanese carriers had been the prime goal of pacific naval battles up to that point and the failure to pursue the japanese fleet carriers and destroy them had been a major criticism of spruance in some circles whose fifth fleet missed the opportunity at the battle of the philippine sean  halseys typhoonedit main article typhoon cobra  uss langley struggles in typhoon cobra after the leyte gulf engagement december found the third fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of typhoon cobra which was dubbed halseys typhoon by many while conducting operations off the philippines the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a pacific storm rather than move third fleet away halsey chose to remain on station for another day in fairness he received conflicting information from pearl harbor and his own staff the hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm which would have cleared task force  by some two hundred miles eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction however halsey played the odds declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of third fleet to hold formation on the evening of december  the combat air patrol over third fleet was unable to land their aircraft aboard the pitching and rolling carriers the pilots were forced to ditch in the ocean the aircraft were lost but all the pilots were picked up by escorting destroyers by  am the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously still the fleet attempted to maintain stations finally at  am halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them something which many ships had already been forced to do between  am and  pm the typhoon did its worst damage tossing the ships in seventyfoot waves the barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at eightythree knots with gusts well over  knots at  pm halsey issued a typhoon warning to fleet weather central by this time the third fleet had already lost three destroyers the storm inflicted damage on a great many ships in the fleet with the loss of some  men and  aircraft third fleet conducted search and rescue operations for three days following the storm finally retiring for repairs at ulithi on december  following the typhoon a navy court of inquiry was convened on board the uss cascade ad in the naval base at ulithi admiral nimitz cincpac was in attendance at the court fortythreeyearold captain herbert k gates of the cascade was the judge advocate the inquiry found that though halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the third fleet into the heart of the typhoon it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction the events surrounding typhoon cobra were similar to those the japanese navy itself faced some nine years earlier in what they termed the fourth fleet incident end of the waredit fleet admiral nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board uss missouri behind him stand gen douglas macarthur adm william halsey and rear adm forrest sherman during january  the third fleet attacked formosa and luzon and raided the south china sea in support of the landing of us army forces on luzon at the conclusion of this operation halsey passed command of the ships that made up third fleet to admiral spruance on  january whereupon its designation changed to fifth fleet returning home halsey was asked about general macarthur general macarthur was not the easiest man to work with and vied with the navy over the conduct and management of the war in the pacific halsey

senator rufus king who was an american lawyer politician diplomat and federalist halsey attended the pingry school after waiting two years to receive an appointment to the united states naval academy halsey decided to study medicine at the university of virginia and then join the navy as a physician he chose virginia because his best friend karl osterhause was there while there halsey joined the delta psi fraternity and was also a member of the secretive seven society after his first year halsey received his appointment to the united states naval academy at annapolis and entered the academy in the fall of  while attending the academy he lettered in football as a fullback and earned several athletic honors halsey graduated from the naval academy on february   following graduation he spent his early service years in battleships and sailed with the main battle fleet aboard the battleship uss kansas bb as roosevelts great white fleet circumnavigated the globe from  to  halsey was on the bridge of the battleship uss missouri on wednesday april   when a flareback from the port gun in her after turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others no explosion occurred but the rapid burning of the powder burnt and suffocated to death  officers and men this resulted in halsey dreading the th of every month especially when it fell on a friday after his service on the missouri halsey served aboard torpedo boats beginning with uss du pont in  halsey was one of the few officers who was promoted directly from ensign to full lieutenant skipping the rank of lieutenant junior grade torpedoes and torpedo boats became specialties of his and he commanded the first group of the atlantic fleets torpedo flotilla in  through  halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and destroyers during the s and s at that time the destroyer and the torpedo boat though extremely hazardous delivery methods were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships lieutenant commander halseys world war i service including command of uss shaw in  earned him the navy cross interwar yearsedit in october  he was the naval attaché at the american embassy in berlin germany one year later he was given additional duty as naval attaché at the american embassies in christiania norway copenhagen denmark and stockholm sweden he then returned to sea duty again

the scouting force before returning to study at the naval war college in newport rhode island in  the chief of the bureau of aeronautics navy admiral ernest king offered halsey command of the aircraft carrier uss saratoga subject to completion of the course of an air observer captain halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full week naval aviator course rather than the simpler naval aviation observer program i thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot halsey earned his naval aviators wings on may   at the age of  the oldest person to do so in the history of the us navy while he had approval from his wife to train as an observer she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training and she told her daughter what do you think that the old fool is doing now hes learning to fly he went on to command the saratoga and later the naval air station pensacola at pensacola florida halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy commenting the naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation and good captain halsey was promoted to rear admiral in  during this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the aircraft battle force world war iiedit traditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines this view was challenged when army airman general billy mitchell demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel in the interwar debate that followed some saw the carrier as defensive in nature providing air cover to protect the battle group from shorebased aircraft carrierbased aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal the adage capital ships cannot withstand landbased air power was well known aviation proponents however imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system when he testified at admiral husband kimmels hearing after the pearl harbor debacle he summed up american carrier tactics being to get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon in april  halseys ships as part of battle fleet moved to hawaii and in june  he was promoted to vice admiral temporary rank appointed commander carrier division  and commander aircraft battle force with tensions high and war imminent us naval intelligence indicated wake island would be the target of a japanese surprise attack in response on  november  admiral kimmel ordered halsey to take uss enterprise to ferry aircraft to wake island to reinforce the marines there kimmel had given halsey a free hand to attack and destroy any japanese military forces encountered the planes flew off her deck on december  highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the japanese carrier force halsey gave orders to sink any shipping sighted shoot down any plane encountered protested his operations officer goddammit admiral you cant start a private war of your own whos going to take the responsibility said halsey ill take it if anything gets in my way well shoot first and argue afterwards a storm delayed enterprise on her return voyage to hawaii instead of returning on december  as planned she was still  miles out at sea when she received word that the surprise attack anticipated was not at wake island but at pearl harbor itself news of the attack came in the form of overhearing desperate radio transmissions from one of her aircraft sent forward to pearl harbor attempting to identify itself as american the plane was shot down and her pilot and crew were lost in the immediate wake of the attack upon pearl harbor admiral kimmel named halsey commander of all the ships at sea enterprise searched south and west of the hawaiian islands for the japanese attackers but did not locate the six japanese fleet carriers then retiring to the north and west early pacific carrier raidsedit an sbd dauntless flies antisubmarine patrol over enterprise and saratoga vice admiral halsey and enterprise slipped back into pearl harbor on the evening of december  surveying the wreckage of the pacific fleet he remarked before were through with them the japanese language will be spoken only in hell halsey was an aggressive commander above all else he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the us navys fighting spirit when most required in the early months of the war as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy serving as commander carrier division  aboard his flagship enterprise halsey led a series of hitandrun raids against the japanese striking the gilbert and marshall islands in february wake island in march and carrying out the doolittle raid in april  against the japanese capital tokyo and other places on japans largest and most populous island honshu the first air raid to strike the japanese home islands providing an important boost to american morale halseys slogan hit hard hit fast hit often soon became a byword for the navy halsey returned to pearl harbor from his last raid on may   in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand he had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier enterprise directing the navys counterstrikes a debilitating chronic skin condition covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching making it nearly impossible for him to sleep gaunt and having lost twenty pounds he was medically ordered to the hospital in hawaii meanwhile us naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the japanese were planning an attack on the central pacific island of midway admiral chester nimitz commander in chief us pacific fleet determined to take the opportunity to engage them losing midway would have been a very serious threat because the japanese then could easily take hawaii and threaten the west coast of the united states the loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral halsey on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to nimitz nimitz met with halsey who recommended his cruiser division commander rear admiral raymond spruance to take command for the upcoming midway operation nimitz considered the move but it would mean stepping over rear admiral frank fletcher of task force  who was the senior of the two men after interviewing fletcher and reviewing his reports from the coral sea engagement nimitz was convinced that fletchers performance was sound and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of midway acting upon halseys recommendations nimitz then made rear admiral spruance commander of halseys task force  comprising the carriers enterprise and hornet to aid spruance who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff captain miles browning the ensuing harrowing battle of midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the united states and a dramatic victory for the us navy halseys skin condition was so serious he was sent on the light cruiser uss detroit to san francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment the skin condition soon receded but halsey was ordered to stand down for the next  weeks and relax while detached stateside during his convalescence he visited family and travelled to washington dc in late august he accepted a speaking engagement at the us naval academy at annapolis prior to the discussion of his raids against the japanese positions in the marshall islands halsey informed the midshipmen before him missing the battle of midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career but i am going back to the pacific where i intend personally to have a crack at those yellowbellied sons of bitches and their carriers which was received with loud applause at the completion of his convalescence in september  admiral nimitz reassigned halsey to commander air force pacific fleet south pacific area commandedit halsey in the south pacific after being medically approved to return to duty halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the south pacific area since enterprise was still laid up in pearl harbor undergoing repairs following the battle of the eastern solomons and the other ships of task force  were still being readied he began a familiarization trip to the south pacific on october   arriving at area headquarters at nouméa in new caledonia on the th the guadalcanal campaign was at a critical juncture with the st marine division  men under the combat command of marine major general alexander a vandergrift holding on by a thread around henderson air field the marines did receive additional support from the us armys th regiment with a complement of  soldiers on october  this addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself during this critical juncture naval support was tenuous due to vice admiral robert l ghormleys reticence malaise and lackluster performance pacific fleet commander chester nimitz had concluded that vice admiral ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted nimitz made his decision to change the south pacific area command while halsey was en route as halseys aircraft came to rest in nouméa a whaleboat came alongside carrying ghormleys flag lieutenant meeting him before he could board the flagship the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from nimitz you will take command of the south pacific area and south pacific forces immediately the order came as an awkward surprise to halsey ghormley was a long time personal friend and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at annapolis awkward or not the two men carried out their directives halseys command now included all ground sea and air forces in the south pacific area news of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered marines energizing his command he was widely considered the us navys most aggressive admiral and with good reason he set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed ghormley had been unsure of his commands ability to maintain the marine toehold on guadalcanal and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the bataan peninsula disaster halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the marines he not only intended to counter the japanese efforts to dislodge them he intended to secure the island above all else he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the japanese it was two days after halsey had taken command in october  that he gave an order that all naval officers in the south pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms as richard frank commented in his account of the battle for guadalcanal halsey said he gave this order to conform to army practice and for comfort to his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war halsey led the south pacific command through what was for the us navy the most tenuous phase of the war halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around guadalcanal including the carrier engagements of the battle of the santa cruz islands and the naval battle of guadalcanal these engagements checked the japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots admirals nimitz and halsey discuss south pacific strategy in early  in november halseys willingness to place at risk his commands two fast battleships in the confined waters around guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the us navy winning the naval battle of guadalcanal the decisive naval engagement of the guadalcanal campaign that doomed the japanese garrison and wrested control from the japanese the solomons campaign ended up being a meat grinder of ijn aviation in april  halsey assigned admiral marc mitscher to commander air solomon islands comairsols where he directed a mixed bag of army navy marine and new zealand aircraft in the airwar over guadalcanal and up the solomon chain said halsey i knew wed probably catch hell from the japs in the air thats why i sent pete mitscher up there pete was a fighting fool and i knew it typical for the period was an exchange that occurred between halsey and one of his staff officers in june  south pacific command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive as a part of the long view of winning the war taken by nimitz upon its arrival at fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training south pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the solomon chain the staff officer who brought the dispatch to halsey remarked if they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive the admiral turned to the speaker and replied as long as i have one plane and one pilot i will stay on the offensive admiral halseys forces spent the rest of the year battling up the solomon islands chain to bougainville at bougainville the japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island and another at the northern most peninsula with a fourth on buki just across the northern passage here instead of landing near the japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the japanese defenders halsey landed his invasion force of  marines in empress augusta bay about halfway up the west coast of bougainville there he had the seabees clear and build their own airfield two days after the landing a large cruiser force was sent down from japan to rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against halseys screening force and supply ships in empress augusta bay the japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers along with one light cruiser and four destroyers at rabaul the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them the battleships washington south dakota and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the central pacific to support the upcoming invasion of tarawa other than the destroyer screen the only force halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on saratoga and princeton rabaul was a heavily fortified port with five airfields and extensive antiaircraft batteries other than the surprise raid at pearl harbor no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft it was highly dangerous to the aircrews and to the carriers as well with the landing in the balance halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of rabaul then launch a daybreak raid on the base aircraft from recently captured vella lavella were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers all available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself the mission was a stunning success so damaging the cruiser force at rabaul as to make them no longer a threat aircraft losses in the raid were light halsey later described the threat to the landings the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as comsopac following the successful bougainville operation he then isolated and neutralized the japanese naval stronghold at rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the bismarck archipelago in a series of amphibious landings known as operation cartwheel this enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself with the neutralization of rabaul major operations in the south pacific command came to a close with his determination and grit halsey had bolstered his commands resolve and seized the initiative from the japanese until ships aircraft and crews produced and trained in the states could arrive in  and  to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies battles of the central pacificedit adm halsey confers with task force  commander and fellow dirty trickster adm john s mccain sr on board halseys flagship the uss new jersey  as the war progressed it moved out of the south pacific and into the central pacific admiral halseys command shifted with it and in may  he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed third fleet he commanded actions from the philippines to japan from september  to january  he led the campaigns to take the palaus leyte and luzon and on many raids on japanese bases including off the shores of formosa china and vietnam by this point in the conflict the us navy was doing things the japanese high command had not thought possible the fast carrier task force was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in moreover the navys ability to establish forward operating ports as they did at majuro enewetak and ulithi and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western pacific the japanese navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy the us navy remained at sea and on station dominating whatever region it entered the size of the pacific ocean which japanese planners had thought would limit the us navys ability to operate in the western pacific would not be adequate to protect japan command of the big blue fleet was alternated with raymond spruancen  under spruance the fleet designation was the fifth fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  under halsey the fleet was designated third fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  the split command structure was intended to confuse the japanese and created a higher tempo of operations while spruance was at sea operating the fleet halsey and his staff selfdubbed the department of dirty tricks would be planning the next series of operations the two admirals were a contrast in styles halsey was aggressive and a risk taker spruance was calculating professional and cautious most higherranking officers preferred to serve under spruance most common sailors were proud to serve under halsey leyte gulfedit halsey dines with crew of uss new jersey november  in october  amphibious forces of the us seventh fleet carried out general douglas macarthurs major landings on the island of leyte in the central philippines halseys third fleet was assigned to cover and support seventh fleet operations around leyte halseys plans assumed the japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort creating an opportunity to engage it decisively halsey directed the third fleet will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces in response to the invasion the japanese launched their final major naval effort an operation known as shogo involving almost all their surviving fleet it was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the leyte gulf the northern force of admiral ozawa was built around the remaining japanese aircraft carriers now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots the northern force was meant to lure the covering us forces away from the gulf while two surface battlegroups the center force and the southern force were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping these forces were built around the remaining strength of the japanese navy and comprised a total of  battleships and  cruisers the operation brought about the battle for leyte gulf the largest naval battle of the second world war and by some criteria the largest naval battle in history the center force commanded by vice admiral takeo kurita was located october  coming through the palawan passage by two american submarines which attacked the force sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third the following day third fleets aircraft carriers launched strikes against kuritas center force sinking the battleship musashi and damaging the heavy cruiser myōkō causing the force to turn westward back towards its base kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the san bernardino strait at this point ozawas northern force was located by third fleet scout aircraft halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the japanese carrier forces planning to strike them at dawn of october  he considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait and made tentative plans to do so but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover weakening his chance to crush the remaining japanese carrier forces the entire third fleet steamed northward san bernardino strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet battle off samaredit in moving third fleet northwards halsey failed to advise admiral thomas kinkaid of seventh fleet of his decision seventh fleet intercepts of organizational messages from halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the san bernardino strait but this was not the case kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with halsey and neither had confirmed this with nimitz despite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of – october of kuritas center force in the san bernardino strait halsey continued to take third fleet northwards away from leyte gulf halsey with vice admiral john s mccain sr when kuritas center force emerged from the san bernardino strait on the morning of october  there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and destroyer escorts task unit  taffy  which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarinesclarification needed not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since midway led by the largest battleship in the world advancing down the coast of the island of samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the leyte gulf landing they took seventh fleets escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise in the desperate battle off samar which followed kuritas ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers screen and damaging a number of other ships as well the remarkable resistance of the screening ships of the escort carrier groups against kuritas battlegroup remains one of the most heroic feats in the storied history of the us navy their efforts and those of the aircraft that the escort carriers could put up took a heavy toll on kuritas ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case mistaking the escort carriers for halseys fleet carriers and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the third fleet battleship group he decided to withdraw back through the san bernardino strait and to the west without achieving his objective of the leyte landing when the seventh fleets escort carriers found themselves under attack from the center force halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off samar for over two hours halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls then shortly after  hours a message was received from admiral nimitz where is repeat where is task force  the world wonders the tail end of this message the world wonders was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to halsey the urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke the fiery halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing finally halseys chief of staff rear admiral robert mick carney confronted him telling halsey stop it what the hells the matter with you pull yourself together halsey cooled but continued to steam third fleet northward to close on ozawas northern force for a full hour after receiving the signal from nimitz then halsey ordered task force  south as task force  proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to  knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers the refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay by the time task force  arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the seventh fleets escort carrier groups kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area a single straggling destroyer was caught by halseys advance cruisers and destroyers but the rest of kuritas force was able to escape meanwhile the major part third fleet continued to close on ozawas northern force which included one fleet carrier the last surviving japanese carrier of the six that had attacked pearl harbor and three light carriers the battle of cape engaño resulted in halseys third fleet sinking all four of ozawas carriers the same attributes that made halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war his desire to bring the fight to the enemy his willingness to take on a gamble worked against him in the later stages of the war halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle with naval historian samuel morison terming the third fleet run to the north halseys blunder however the destruction of the japanese carriers had been the prime goal of pacific naval battles up to that point and the failure to pursue the japanese fleet carriers and destroy them had been a major criticism of spruance in some circles whose fifth fleet missed the opportunity at the battle of the philippine sean  halseys typhoonedit main article typhoon cobra  uss langley struggles in typhoon cobra after the leyte gulf engagement december found the third fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of typhoon cobra which was dubbed halseys typhoon by many while conducting operations off the philippines the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a pacific storm rather than move third fleet away halsey chose to remain on station for another day in fairness he received conflicting information from pearl harbor and his own staff the hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm which would have cleared task force  by some two hundred miles eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction however halsey played the odds declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of third fleet to hold formation on the evening of december  the combat air patrol over third fleet was unable to land their aircraft aboard the pitching and rolling carriers the pilots were forced to ditch in the ocean the aircraft were lost but all the pilots were picked up by escorting destroyers by  am the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously still the fleet attempted to maintain stations finally at  am halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them something which many ships had already been forced to do between  am and  pm the typhoon did its worst damage tossing the ships in seventyfoot waves the barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at eightythree knots with gusts well over  knots at  pm halsey issued a typhoon warning to fleet weather central by this time the third fleet had already lost three destroyers the storm inflicted damage on a great many ships in the fleet with the loss of some  men and  aircraft third fleet conducted search and rescue operations for three days following the storm finally retiring for repairs at ulithi on december  following the typhoon a navy court of inquiry was convened on board the uss cascade ad in the naval base at ulithi admiral nimitz cincpac was in attendance at the court fortythreeyearold captain herbert k gates of the cascade was the judge advocate the inquiry found that though halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the third fleet into the heart of the typhoon it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction the events surrounding typhoon cobra were similar to those the japanese navy itself faced some nine years earlier in what they termed the fourth fleet incident end of the waredit fleet admiral nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board uss missouri behind him stand gen douglas macarthur adm william halsey and rear adm forrest sherman during january  the third fleet attacked formosa and luzon and raided the south china sea in support of the landing of us army forces on luzon at the conclusion of this operation halsey passed command of the ships that made up third fleet to admiral spruance on  january whereupon its designation changed to fifth fleet returning home halsey was asked about general macarthur general macarthur was not the easiest man to work with and vied with the navy over the conduct and management of the war in the pacific halsey had worked well with macarthur and did not mind saying so when a reporter asked halsey if he thought general macarthurs fleet th fleet would get to tokyo first the admiral grinned and answered were going there together then seriously he added hes a very fine man i have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him spruance held command of th fleet until may when command returned to halsey in early june  rd fleet again sailed through the path of typhoon connie on this occasion six men were swept overboard and lost along with  airplanes lost or destroyed with another  badly damaged though some ships sustained significant damage none were lost a navy court of inquiry was again convened this time recommending that halsey be reassigned but admiral nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation citing halseys prior service record halsey led third fleet through the final stages of the war striking targets on the japanese homeland itself third fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon tokyo the naval base at kure and the northern japanese island of hokkaidō and third fleet battleships engaged in the bombardment of a number of japanese coastal cities in preparation for an invasion of japan which ultimately never had to be undertaken after the cessation of hostilities halsey still aggressively cautious of japanese kamikaze attacks

halsey decided to study medicine at the university of virginia and then join the navy as a physician he chose virginia because his best friend karl osterhause was there while there halsey joined the delta psi fraternity and was also a member of the secretive seven society after his first year halsey received his appointment to the united states naval academy at annapolis and entered the academy in the fall of  while attending the academy he lettered in football as a fullback and earned several athletic honors halsey graduated from the naval academy on february   following graduation he spent his early service years in battleships and sailed with the main battle fleet aboard the battleship uss kansas bb as roosevelts great white fleet circumnavigated the globe from  to  halsey was on the bridge of the battleship uss missouri on wednesday april   when a flareback from the port gun in her after turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others no explosion occurred but the rapid burning of the powder burnt and suffocated to death  officers and men this resulted in halsey dreading the th of every month especially when it fell on a friday after his service on the missouri halsey served aboard torpedo boats beginning with uss du pont in  halsey was one of the few officers who was promoted directly from ensign to full lieutenant skipping the rank of lieutenant junior grade torpedoes and torpedo boats became specialties of his and he commanded the first group of the atlantic fleets torpedo flotilla in  through  halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and destroyers during the s and s at that time the destroyer and the torpedo boat though extremely hazardous delivery methods were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships lieutenant commander halseys world war i service including command of uss shaw in  earned him the navy cross interwar yearsedit in october  he was the naval attaché at the american embassy in berlin germany one year later he was given additional duty as naval attaché at the american embassies in christiania norway copenhagen denmark and stockholm sweden he then returned to sea duty again

the scouting force before returning to study at the naval war college in newport rhode island in  the chief of the bureau of aeronautics navy admiral ernest king offered halsey command of the aircraft carrier uss saratoga subject to completion of the course of an air observer captain halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full week naval aviator course rather than the simpler naval aviation observer program i thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot halsey earned his naval aviators wings on may   at the age of  the oldest person to do so in the history of the us navy while he had approval from his wife to train as an observer she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training and she told her daughter what do you think that the old fool is doing now hes learning to fly he went on to command the saratoga and later the naval air station pensacola at pensacola florida halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy commenting the naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation and good captain halsey was promoted to rear admiral in  during this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the aircraft battle force world war iiedit traditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines this view was challenged when army airman general billy mitchell demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel in the interwar debate that followed some saw the carrier as defensive in nature providing air cover to protect the battle group from shorebased aircraft carrierbased aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal the adage capital ships cannot withstand landbased air power was well known aviation proponents however imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system when he testified at admiral husband kimmels hearing after the pearl harbor debacle he summed up american carrier tactics being to get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon in april  halseys ships as part of battle fleet moved to hawaii and in june  he was promoted to vice admiral temporary rank appointed commander carrier division  and commander aircraft battle force with tensions high and war imminent us naval intelligence indicated wake island would be the target of a japanese surprise attack in response on  november  admiral kimmel ordered halsey to take uss enterprise to ferry aircraft to wake island to reinforce the marines there kimmel had given halsey a free hand to attack and destroy any japanese military forces encountered the planes flew off her deck on december  highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the japanese carrier force halsey gave orders to sink any shipping sighted shoot down any plane encountered protested his operations officer goddammit admiral you cant start a private war of your own whos going to take the responsibility said halsey ill take it if anything gets in my way well shoot first and argue afterwards a storm delayed enterprise on her return voyage to hawaii instead of returning on december  as planned she was still  miles out at sea when she received word that the surprise attack anticipated was not at wake island but at pearl harbor itself news of the attack came in the form of overhearing desperate radio transmissions from one of her aircraft sent forward to pearl harbor attempting to identify itself as american the plane was shot down and her pilot and crew were lost in the immediate wake of the attack upon pearl harbor admiral kimmel named halsey commander of all the ships at sea enterprise searched south and west of the hawaiian islands for the japanese attackers but did not locate the six japanese fleet carriers then retiring to the north and west early pacific carrier raidsedit an sbd dauntless flies antisubmarine patrol over enterprise and saratoga vice admiral halsey and enterprise slipped back into pearl harbor on the evening of december  surveying the wreckage of the pacific fleet he remarked before were through with them the japanese language will be spoken only in hell halsey was an aggressive commander above all else he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the us navys fighting spirit when most required in the early months of the war as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy serving as commander carrier division  aboard his flagship enterprise halsey led a series of hitandrun raids against the japanese striking the gilbert and marshall islands in february wake island in march and carrying out the doolittle raid in april  against the japanese capital tokyo and other places on japans largest and most populous island honshu the first air raid to strike the japanese home islands providing an important boost to american morale halseys slogan hit hard hit fast hit often soon became a byword for the navy halsey returned to pearl harbor from his last raid on may   in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand he had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier enterprise directing the navys counterstrikes a debilitating chronic skin condition covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching making it nearly impossible for him to sleep gaunt and having lost twenty pounds he was medically ordered to the hospital in hawaii meanwhile us naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the japanese were planning an attack on the central pacific island of midway admiral chester nimitz commander in chief us pacific fleet determined to take the opportunity to engage them losing midway would have been a very serious threat because the japanese then could easily take hawaii and threaten the west coast of the united states the loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral halsey on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to nimitz nimitz met with halsey who recommended his cruiser division commander rear admiral raymond spruance to take command for the upcoming midway operation nimitz considered the move but it would mean stepping over rear admiral frank fletcher of task force  who was the senior of the two men after interviewing fletcher and reviewing his reports from the coral sea engagement nimitz was convinced that fletchers performance was sound and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of midway acting upon halseys recommendations nimitz then made rear admiral spruance commander of halseys task force  comprising the carriers enterprise and hornet to aid spruance who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff captain miles browning the ensuing harrowing battle of midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the united states and a dramatic victory for the us navy halseys skin condition was so serious he was sent on the light cruiser uss detroit to san francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment the skin condition soon receded but halsey was ordered to stand down for the next  weeks and relax while detached stateside during his convalescence he visited family and travelled to washington dc in late august he accepted a speaking engagement at the us naval academy at annapolis prior to the discussion of his raids against the japanese positions in the marshall islands halsey informed the midshipmen before him missing the battle of midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career but i am going back to the pacific where i intend personally to have a crack at those yellowbellied sons of bitches and their carriers which was received with loud applause at the completion of his convalescence in september  admiral nimitz reassigned halsey to commander air force pacific fleet south pacific area commandedit halsey in the south pacific after being medically approved to return to duty halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the south pacific area since enterprise was still laid up in pearl harbor undergoing repairs following the battle of the eastern solomons and the other ships of task force  were still being readied he began a familiarization trip to the south pacific on october   arriving at area headquarters at nouméa in new caledonia on the th the guadalcanal campaign was at a critical juncture with the st marine division  men under the combat command of marine major general alexander a vandergrift holding on by a thread around henderson air field the marines did receive additional support from the us armys th regiment with a complement of  soldiers on october  this addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself during this critical juncture naval support was tenuous due to vice admiral robert l ghormleys reticence malaise and lackluster performance pacific fleet commander chester nimitz had concluded that vice admiral ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted nimitz made his decision to change the south pacific area command while halsey was en route as halseys aircraft came to rest in nouméa a whaleboat came alongside carrying ghormleys flag lieutenant meeting him before he could board the flagship the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from nimitz you will take command of the south pacific area and south pacific forces immediately the order came as an awkward surprise to halsey ghormley was a long time personal friend and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at annapolis awkward or not the two men carried out their directives halseys command now included all ground sea and air forces in the south pacific area news of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered marines energizing his command he was widely considered the us navys most aggressive admiral and with good reason he set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed ghormley had been unsure of his commands ability to maintain the marine toehold on guadalcanal and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the bataan peninsula disaster halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the marines he not only intended to counter the japanese efforts to dislodge them he intended to secure the island above all else he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the japanese it was two days after halsey had taken command in october  that he gave an order that all naval officers in the south pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms as richard frank commented in his account of the battle for guadalcanal halsey said he gave this order to conform to army practice and for comfort to his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war halsey led the south pacific command through what was for the us navy the most tenuous phase of the war halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around guadalcanal including the carrier engagements of the battle of the santa cruz islands and the naval battle of guadalcanal these engagements checked the japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots admirals nimitz and halsey discuss south pacific strategy in early  in november halseys willingness to place at risk his commands two fast battleships in the confined waters around guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the us navy winning the naval battle of guadalcanal the decisive naval engagement of the guadalcanal campaign that doomed the japanese garrison and wrested control from the japanese the solomons campaign ended up being a meat grinder of ijn aviation in april  halsey assigned admiral marc mitscher to commander air solomon islands comairsols where he directed a mixed bag of army navy marine and new zealand aircraft in the airwar over guadalcanal and up the solomon chain said halsey i knew wed probably catch hell from the japs in the air thats why i sent pete mitscher up there pete was a fighting fool and i knew it typical for the period was an exchange that occurred between halsey and one of his staff officers in june  south pacific command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive as a part of the long view of winning the war taken by nimitz upon its arrival at fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training south pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the solomon chain the staff officer who brought the dispatch to halsey remarked if they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive the admiral turned to the speaker and replied as long as i have one plane and one pilot i will stay on the offensive admiral halseys forces spent the rest of the year battling up the solomon islands chain to bougainville at bougainville the japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island and another at the northern most peninsula with a fourth on buki just across the northern passage here instead of landing near the japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the japanese defenders halsey landed his invasion force of  marines in empress augusta bay about halfway up the west coast of bougainville there he had the seabees clear and build their own airfield two days after the landing a large cruiser force was sent down from japan to rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against halseys screening force and supply ships in empress augusta bay the japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers along with one light cruiser and four destroyers at rabaul the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them the battleships washington south dakota and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the central pacific to support the upcoming invasion of tarawa other than the destroyer screen the only force halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on saratoga and princeton rabaul was a heavily fortified port with five airfields and extensive antiaircraft batteries other than the surprise raid at pearl harbor no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft it was highly dangerous to the aircrews and to the carriers as well with the landing in the balance halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of rabaul then launch a daybreak raid on the base aircraft from recently captured vella lavella were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers all available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself the mission was a stunning success so damaging the cruiser force at rabaul as to make them no longer a threat aircraft losses in the raid were light halsey later described the threat to the landings the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as comsopac following the successful bougainville operation he then isolated and neutralized the japanese naval stronghold at rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the bismarck archipelago in a series of amphibious landings known as operation cartwheel this enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself with the neutralization of rabaul major operations in the south pacific command came to a close with his determination and grit halsey had bolstered his commands resolve and seized the initiative from the japanese until ships aircraft and crews produced and trained in the states could arrive in  and  to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies battles of the central pacificedit adm halsey confers with task force  commander and fellow dirty trickster adm john s mccain sr on board halseys flagship the uss new jersey  as the war progressed it moved out of the south pacific and into the central pacific admiral halseys command shifted with it and in may  he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed third fleet he commanded actions from the philippines to japan from september  to january  he led the campaigns to take the palaus leyte and luzon and on many raids on japanese bases including off the shores of formosa china and vietnam by this point in the conflict the us navy was doing things the japanese high command had not thought possible the fast carrier task force was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in moreover the navys ability to establish forward operating ports as they did at majuro enewetak and ulithi and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western pacific the japanese navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy the us navy remained at sea and on station dominating whatever region it entered the size of the pacific ocean which japanese planners had thought would limit the us navys ability to operate in the western pacific would not be adequate to protect japan command of the big blue fleet was alternated with raymond spruancen  under spruance the fleet designation was the fifth fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  under halsey the fleet was designated third fleet and the fast carrier task force was designated task force  the split command structure was intended to confuse the japanese and created a higher tempo of operations while spruance was at sea operating the fleet halsey and his staff selfdubbed the department of dirty tricks would be planning the next series of operations the two admirals were a contrast in styles halsey was aggressive and a risk taker spruance was calculating professional and cautious most higherranking officers preferred to serve under spruance most common sailors were proud to serve under halsey leyte gulfedit halsey dines with crew of uss new jersey november  in october  amphibious forces of the us seventh fleet carried out general douglas macarthurs major landings on the island of leyte in the central philippines halseys third fleet was assigned to cover and support seventh fleet operations around leyte halseys plans assumed the japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort creating an opportunity to engage it decisively halsey directed the third fleet will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces in response to the invasion the japanese launched their final major naval effort an operation known as shogo involving almost all their surviving fleet it was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the leyte gulf the northern force of admiral ozawa was built around the remaining japanese aircraft carriers now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots the northern force was meant to lure the covering us forces away from the gulf while two surface battlegroups the center force and the southern force were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping these forces were built around the remaining strength of the japanese navy and comprised a total of  battleships and  cruisers the operation brought about the battle for leyte gulf the largest naval battle of the second world war and by some criteria the largest naval battle in history the center force commanded by vice admiral takeo kurita was located october  coming through the palawan passage by two american submarines which attacked the force sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third the following day third fleets aircraft carriers launched strikes against kuritas center force sinking the battleship musashi and damaging the heavy cruiser myōkō causing the force to turn westward back towards its base kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the san bernardino strait at this point ozawas northern force was located by third fleet scout aircraft halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the japanese carrier forces planning to strike them at dawn of october  he considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait and made tentative plans to do so but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover weakening his chance to crush the remaining japanese carrier forces the entire third fleet steamed northward san bernardino strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet battle off samaredit in moving third fleet northwards halsey failed to advise admiral thomas kinkaid of seventh fleet of his decision seventh fleet intercepts of organizational messages from halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the san bernardino strait but this was not the case kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with halsey and neither had confirmed this with nimitz despite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of – october of kuritas center force in the san bernardino strait halsey continued to take third fleet northwards away from leyte gulf halsey with vice admiral john s mccain sr when kuritas center force emerged from the san bernardino strait on the morning of october  there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and destroyer escorts task unit  taffy  which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarinesclarification needed not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since midway led by the largest battleship in the world advancing down the coast of the island of samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the leyte gulf landing they took seventh fleets escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise in the desperate battle off samar which followed kuritas ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers screen and damaging a number of other ships as well the remarkable resistance of the screening ships of the escort carrier groups against kuritas battlegroup remains one of the most heroic feats in the storied history of the us navy their efforts and those of the aircraft that the escort carriers could put up took a heavy toll on kuritas ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case mistaking the escort carriers for halseys fleet carriers and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the third fleet battleship group he decided to withdraw back through the san bernardino strait and to the west without achieving his objective of the leyte landing when the seventh fleets escort carriers found themselves under attack from the center force halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off samar for over two hours halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls then shortly after  hours a message was received from admiral nimitz where is repeat where is task force  the world wonders the tail end of this message the world wonders was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to halsey the urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke the fiery halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing finally halseys chief of staff rear admiral robert mick carney confronted him telling halsey stop it what the hells the matter with you pull yourself together halsey cooled but continued to steam third fleet northward to close on ozawas northern force for a full hour after receiving the signal from nimitz then halsey ordered task force  south as task force  proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to  knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers the refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay by the time task force  arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the seventh fleets escort carrier groups kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area a single straggling destroyer was caught by halseys advance cruisers and destroyers but the rest of kuritas force was able to escape meanwhile the major part third fleet continued to close on ozawas northern force which included one fleet carrier the last surviving japanese carrier of the six that had attacked pearl harbor and three light carriers the battle of cape engaño resulted in halseys third fleet sinking all four of ozawas carriers the same attributes that made halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war his desire to bring the fight to the enemy his willingness to take on a gamble worked against him in the later stages of the war halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle with naval historian samuel morison terming the third fleet run to the north halseys blunder however the destruction of the japanese carriers had been the prime goal of pacific naval battles up to that point and the failure to pursue the japanese fleet carriers and destroy them had been a major criticism of spruance in some circles whose fifth fleet missed the opportunity at the battle of the philippine sean  halseys typhoonedit main article typhoon cobra  uss langley struggles in typhoon cobra after the leyte gulf engagement december found the third fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of typhoon cobra which was dubbed halseys typhoon by many while conducting operations off the philippines the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a pacific storm rather than move third fleet away halsey chose to remain on station for another day in fairness he received conflicting information from pearl harbor and his own staff the hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm which would have cleared task force  by some two hundred miles eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction however halsey played the odds declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of third fleet to hold formation on the evening of december  the combat air patrol over third fleet was unable to land their aircraft aboard the pitching and rolling carriers the pilots were forced to ditch in the ocean the aircraft were lost but all the pilots were picked up by escorting destroyers by  am the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously still the fleet attempted to maintain stations finally at  am halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them something which many ships had already been forced to do between  am and  pm the typhoon did its worst damage tossing the ships in seventyfoot waves the barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at eightythree knots with gusts well over  knots at  pm halsey issued a typhoon warning to fleet weather central by this time the third fleet had already lost three destroyers the storm inflicted damage on a great many ships in the fleet with the loss of some  men and  aircraft third fleet conducted search and rescue operations for three days following the storm finally retiring for repairs at ulithi on december  following the typhoon a navy court of inquiry was convened on board the uss cascade ad in the naval base at ulithi admiral nimitz cincpac was in attendance at the court fortythreeyearold captain herbert k gates of the cascade was the judge advocate the inquiry found that though halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the third fleet into the heart of the typhoon it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction the events surrounding typhoon cobra were similar to those the japanese navy itself faced some nine years earlier in what they termed the fourth fleet incident end of the waredit fleet admiral nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board uss missouri behind him stand gen douglas macarthur adm william halsey and rear adm forrest sherman during january  the third fleet attacked formosa and luzon and raided the south china sea in support of the landing of us army forces on luzon at the conclusion of this operation halsey passed command of the ships that made up third fleet to admiral spruance on  january whereupon its designation changed to fifth fleet returning home halsey was asked about general macarthur general macarthur was not the easiest man to work with and vied with the navy over the conduct and management of the war in the pacific halsey had worked well with macarthur and did not mind saying so when a reporter asked halsey if he thought general macarthurs fleet th fleet would get to tokyo first the admiral grinned and answered were going there together then seriously he added hes a very fine man i have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him spruance held command of th fleet until may when command returned to halsey in early june  rd fleet again sailed through the path of typhoon connie on this occasion six men were swept overboard and lost along with  airplanes lost or destroyed with another  badly damaged though some ships sustained significant damage none were lost a navy court of inquiry was again convened this time recommending that halsey be reassigned but admiral nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation citing halseys prior service record halsey led third fleet through the final stages of the war striking targets on the japanese homeland itself third fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon tokyo the naval base at kure and the northern japanese island of hokkaidō and third fleet battleships engaged in the bombardment of a number of japanese coastal cities in preparation for an invasion of japan which ultimately never had to be undertaken after the cessation of hostilities halsey still aggressively cautious of japanese kamikaze attacks ordered third fleet to maintain a protective air cover with the following communiqué cessation of hostilities war is over if any japanese airplanes appear shoot them down in a friendly way he was present when japan formally surrendered on the deck of his flagship uss missouri on september   postwar yearsedit halsey immediately after the surrender of japan  ships of the third fleet returned to

admiral halsey made a goodwill flying trip passing by central and south america covering nearly  miles and  nations he retired from active service in march  but as a fleet admiral he was not taken off

middle georgia market cox communications state director of finance georgia key market charter communications director of supply chain erp and logistics cox communications education alabama state university bs in accounting    as a transportation and logistics sergeant during the first gulf war william cossey jr was responsible for bringing tracked military vehicles to the front in civilian life however cossey was studying accounting when he left the army national guard in  he assumed that was the end of his association with logistics then in  cossey was named director of business operations for cox communications middle georgia market and supply chain fell under his area of responsibility he liked that aspect of his work so much that several promotions later he embraced the chance to become director of supply chain enterprise resource planning erp and logistics for cox the nations thirdlargest cable services provider in december  atlantabased cox named cossey executive director supply chain integration what makes supply chain management so appealing i never wanted to be strictly a bean counter cossey says throughout his finance career hed always felt drawn to operations supply chain puts you in the middle of the action reporting to the vice president of supply chain cossey is responsible for all the processes and systems involved in managing coxs inventory at the corporate level hes also in charge of forecasting and planning and distribution and fulfillment inventory at cox comes in two varieties the first is customer premises equipment—the settop boxes modems and other equipment used in coxs tv data voice and wireless services the second type of inventory is equipment for coxs network infrastructure until recently each of coxs markets managed its supply chain independently in  however cossey launched an initiative to centralize that function the effort began with settop boxes and two suppliers and has grown to encompass more products and the largest  of coxs  suppliers cox centralized its supply chain management to better balance supply and demand companywide thats not easy in a firm that not only delivers product to new customers but also must maintain leased consumer products and network hardware endoflife management is a challenge cossey says but simply delivering new product can become tricky especially when hordes of customers sign on at once thats what happened in december  just as the corporate supply chain organization was hitting the ground with inventory short cossey and his team pulled strings with vendors to obtain more settop boxes in a hurry they made sure that the product flowed first to markets where the need was greatest in the past managers in each market would have called the suppliers individually competing for the same limited pool of boxes the new process was much more effective the fact that we had that model even though it was in its infancy made it a very palatable challenge cossey says with that new model now firmly in place cosseys team and coxs sourcing organization are preparing for a new challenge were going to spend this year giving the supply chain a facelift he says that means examining every process to find which ones offer room for optimization then of course theyll put improvements in place for a man like cossey who loves working right in the center of things such a project is bound to be an enjoyable adventure the big questions what do you do when youre not at work i have one child in middle school and two in high school so afterschool activities comprise most of my nights and weekends we try to take three or four family trips every year i used to play golf but i just dont get the chance these days ideal dinner companion the composer john williams i took my kids to see star wars in concert and it was amazing whats in your laptop bag laptop cables general office supplies and the current issue of multichannel news when its time to pack up at the end of the day the only additions are my trusty composition book and laptop business motto anything is possible if you didnt work in supply chain management what would be your dream job a conductor or band
