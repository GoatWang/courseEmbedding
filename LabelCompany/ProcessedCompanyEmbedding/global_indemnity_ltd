general agencies that have limited quoting and binding authority as well as a number of wholesale insurance brokers who in turn sell the companys insurance products to insureds through table of contents retail insurance brokers commercial lines operates predominantly in the excess and surplus lines marketplace the company manages its commercial lines segment via product classification these product classifications are  pennamerica which includes property and general liability products for small commercial businesses distributed through a select network of wholesale general agents with specific binding authority  united national which includes property general liability and professional lines products distributed through program administrators with specific binding authority and  diamond state which includes property casualty and professional lines products distributed through wholesale brokers and program administrators with specific binding authority the companys personal lines segment via american reliable offers specialty personal lines and agricultural coverage through a group of approximately  agents primarily comprised of wholesale general agents with specific binding authority in the admitted marketplace the companys reinsurance operations consisting solely of the operations of global indemnity reinsurance currently provides reinsurance solutions through brokers and on a direct basis global indemnity reinsurance is a bermuda based treaty reinsurer for specialty property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies global indemnity reinsurance conducts business in bermuda and is focused on using its capital capacity to write catastropheoriented placements and other niche or specialtyfocused treaties meeting the companys risk tolerance and return thresholds the company derives its revenues primarily from premiums paid on insurance policies that it writes and from income generated by its investment portfolio net of fees paid for investment management services the amount of insurance premiums that the company receives is a function of the amount and type of policies it writes as well as prevailing market prices the companys expenses include losses and loss adjustment expenses acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses corporate and other operating expenses interest investment expenses and income taxes losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated by management and reflect the companys best estimate of ultimate losses and costs arising during the reporting period and revisions of prior period estimates the company records its best estimate of losses and loss adjustment expenses considering both internal and external actuarial analyses of the estimated losses the company expects to incur on the insurance policies it writes the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses will depend on the actual costs to resolve claims acquisition costs consist principally of commissions and premium taxes that are typically a percentage of the premiums on the insurance policies the company writes net of ceding commissions earned from reinsurers other underwriting expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses

critical accounting estimates and policies the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap which require it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods see note  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  of part ii of this report actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions the company believes that of the companys significant accounting policies the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and estimation table of contents liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses although variability is inherent in estimates the company believes that the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses reflects managements best estimate for future amounts needed to pay losses and related loss adjustment expenses and the impact of its reinsurance coverage with respect to insured events in developing loss and loss adjustment expense loss or losses reserve estimates for the us insurance operations the companys actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses each quarter to perform the analysis the data is organized at a reserve category level a reserve category can be a line of business such as commercial automobile liability or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect the reserves within a reserve category level are characterized as longtail or shorttail for longtail business it will generally be several years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled the companys longtail exposures include general liability professional liability products liability commercial automobile liability and excess and umbrella shorttail exposures include property commercial automobile physical damage and equine mortality to manage its insurance operations the company differentiates by product classifications which are pennamerica united national diamond state and american reliable for further discussion about the companys product classifications see generalbusiness segmentsinsurance operations in item  of part i of this report each of the companys product classifications contain both longtail and shorttail exposures every reserve category is analyzed by the companys actuaries each quarter management is responsible for the final determination of loss reserve selections loss reserve estimates for the companys reinsurance operations are developed by independent external actuaries at least annually however management is responsible for the final determination of loss reserve selections the data for this analysis is organized by treaty and treaty year as with the companys reserves for its insurance operations reserves for its reinsurance operations are characterized as longtail or shorttail longtail exposures include workers compensation professional liability and excess and umbrella liability shorttail exposures are primarily catastrophe exposed property and marine accounts in addition to the companys internal reserve analysis independent external actuaries perform a full detailed review of the insurance and reinsurance operations reserves annually the company reviews both the internal and external actuarial analyses in determining its reserve position the actuarial methods used to project ultimate losses for both longtail and shorttail reserve categories include but are not limited to the following paid development method incurred development method expected loss ratio method bornhuetterferguson method using premiums and paid loss bornhuetterferguson method using premiums and incurred loss and average loss method the paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident years with further expected changes in paid loss selection of the paid loss pattern requires analysis of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims the impact of judicial decisions the impact of underwriting changes the impact of large claim payments and other factors claim cost inflation itself requires evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property changes in the cost of medical care changes in the cost of wage replacement judicial decisions legislative changes and other factors because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate changes in any of these factors can impact the results since the method does not rely on case reserves it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves table of contents for many reserve categories paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for reliable loss projections this situation often exists for longtail exposures in addition changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns finally estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for longtail reserve categories the incurred development method is similar to the paid development method but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses since this method uses more data case reserves in addition to paid losses than the paid development method the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid development patterns however selection of the incurred loss pattern requires analysis of all of the factors listed in the description of the paid development method in addition the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available the expected loss ratio method multiplies premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident year this method may be useful if loss development patterns are inconsistent losses emerge very slowly or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses the selection of the expected loss ratio requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends frequency trends rate changes underwriting changes and other applicable factors the bornhuetterferguson method using premiums and paid losses is a combination of the paid development method and the expected loss ratio method this method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the method used for the expected loss ratio method and requires analysis of the same factors described above the method assumes that only future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level the percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid the use of the pattern from the paid development method requires consideration of all factors listed in the description of the paid development method the estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each accident year this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation the bornhuetterferguson method using premiums and incurred losses is similar to the bornhuetterferguson method using premiums and paid losses except that it uses case incurred losses the use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid development patterns however the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place the method requires analysis of all the factors that need to be reviewed for the expected loss ratio and incurred development methods the average loss method multiplies a projected number of ultimate incurred claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimates since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss this method can provide more reliable results for reserve categories where loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively in addition this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that impact the number and size of claims however this method can be difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes projecting the ultimate number of claims requires analysis of several factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims to the company the impact of judicial decisions the impact of underwriting changes and other factors estimating the ultimate average loss requires analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property changes in the cost of medical care changes in the cost of wage replacement judicial decisions legislative changes and other factors for many reserve categories especially those that can be considered longtail a particular accident year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses in such a table of contents case the companys actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid development method as claims continue to settle and the volume of paid losses increases the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method for most of the companys reserve categories even the case incurred losses for accident years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses in these cases the company will not assign any weight to the paid and incurred development methods and will use the bornhuetterferguson and expected loss ratio methods for shorttail exposures the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner primarily because the companys history includes a sufficient number of accident years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change however the company may also assign weights to the expected loss ratio bornhuetterferguson and average loss methods for shorttail exposures when developing estimates of ultimate losses generally reserves for longtail lines give more weight to the expected loss ratio method in the more recent immature years as the accident years mature weight shifts to the bornhuetterferguson methods and eventually to the incurred andor paid development method claims related to umbrella business are usually reported later than claims for other longtail lines for umbrella business the shift from the expected loss ratio method to the bornhuetterferguson methods to the loss development method may be more protracted than for most longtailed lines reserves for shorttail lines tend to make the shift across methods more quickly than the longtail lines for other more complex reserve categories where the above methods may not produce reliable indications the company uses additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation such reserve categories include losses from construction defect and ae claims for construction defect losses the companys actuaries organize losses by the year in which they were reported to develop an ibnr provision for development on known cases to estimate losses from claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the company pure ibnr various extrapolation techniques are applied to the pattern of claims that have been reported to estimate the number of claims yet to be reported this process requires analysis of several factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims to the company the impact of judicial decisions the impact of underwriting changes and other factors an average claim size is determined from past experience and applied to the number of unreported claims to estimate reserves for these claims establishing reserves for ae and other mass tort claims involves considerably more judgment than other types of claims due to among other things inconsistent court decisions bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestosrelated liabilities and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage the insurance industry continues to receive a substantial number of asbestosrelated bodily injury claims with an increasing focus being directed toward other parties including installers of products containing asbestos rather than against asbestos manufacturers this shift has resulted in significant insurance coverage litigation implicating applicable coverage defenses or determinations if any including but not limited to determinations as to whether or not an asbestosrelated bodily injury claim is subject to aggregate limits of liability found in most comprehensive general liability policies the company continues to closely monitor its asbestos exposure and make adjustments where they are warranted reserve analyses performed by the companys internal and external actuaries result in actuarial point estimates the results of the detailed reserve reviews were summarized and discussed with the companys senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves this group considered many factors in making this decision the factors included but were not limited to the historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and incurred loss patterns the consistency of claims handling processes the consistency of case reserving practices changes in the companys pricing and underwriting and overall pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market table of contents managements best estimate at december   was recorded as the loss reserve managements best estimate is as of a particular point in time and is based upon known facts the companys actuarial analyses current law and the companys judgment this resulted in carried gross and net reserves of  million and  million respectively as of december   a breakout of the companys gross and net reserves excluding the effects of the companys intercompany pooling arrangements and intercompany stop loss and quota share reinsurance agreements as of december   is as follows gross reserves dollars in thousands case ibnr  total commercial lines       personal lines    reinsurance operations    total       net reserves  dollars in thousands case ibnr  total commercial lines       personal lines    reinsurance operations    total        losses incurred but not reported including the expected future emergence of case reserves  does not include reinsurance receivable on paid losses the company continually reviews these estimates and based on new developments and information includes adjustments of the estimated ultimate liability in the operating results for the periods in which the adjustments are made the establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves makes no provision for the possible broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation or the emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in the companys historical experience or that cannot yet be quantified or estimated the company regularly analyzes its reserves and reviews reserving methodologies so that future adjustments to prior accident year reserves can be minimized however given the complexity of this process reserves require continual updates and the ultimate liability may be higher or lower than previously indicated changes in estimates for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are recorded in the period that the change in these estimates is made see note  to the consolidated financial statements in item  of part ii of this report for details concerning the changes in the estimate for incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses related to prior accident years the detailed reserve analyses that the companys internal and external actuaries complete use a variety of generally accepted actuarial methods and techniques to produce a number of estimates of ultimate loss the company determines its best estimate of ultimate loss by reviewing the various estimates provided by its actuaries and other relevant information the reserve estimate is the difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the losses paid to date the difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the case incurred loss paid loss plus case reserve is considered to be ibnr ibnr calculated as such includes a provision for development on known cases supplemental development as well as a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the company pure ibnr in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels the company reviews its reserve estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined the key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various reserve categories and accident years some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method but table of contents most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified an example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method however the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims each reserve category has an implicit frequency and severity for each accident year as a result of the various assumptions made previous reserve analyses have resulted in the companys identification of information and trends that have caused it to increase or decrease frequency and severity assumptions in prior periods and could lead to the identification of a need for additional material changes in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves which could materially affect results of operations equity business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings factors affecting loss frequency include among other things the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns factors affecting loss severity include among other things changes in policy limits and deductibles rate of inflation and judicial interpretations another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag    mar   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage all the companies in jeff bezos’s empire in one large chart why john
