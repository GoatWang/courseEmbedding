opportunities  about risk depositary receipts risk investing in depositary receipts involves the same risks as direct investments in foreign securities in addition the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts the fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less control than if it invested directly in the foreign issuer derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions emerging markets securities risk emerging markets also referred to as developing markets are generally subject to greater market volatility political social and economic instability uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets in addition emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably in addition investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs delays in settlement procedures and lack of timely information foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful geographic focus risk the fund may from time to time invest a substantial amount of its assets in securities of issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries adverse economic political or social conditions in those countries may therefore have a significant negative impact on the funds investment performance growth investing risk growth stocks tend to be more expensive relative to the issuing companys earnings or assets compared with other types of stock as a result they tend to be more sensitive to changes in or investors expectations of the issuing companys earnings and can be more volatile investing in the european union risk investments in certain countries in the european union are susceptible to high economic risks associated with high levels of debt such as investments in sovereign debt of greece italy and spain separately the european union faces issues involving its membership structure procedures and policies the exit of one or more member states from the european union would place its currency and banking system in jeopardy efforts of the member states to further unify their economic and monetary policies may increase the potential for the downward movement of one member states market to cause a similar effect on other member states markets management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of the fund and therefore the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value midcapitalization companies risk midcapitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions and may have more limited product lines and markets less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies these companies securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies and their returns may vary sometimes significantly from the overall securities market preferred securities risk preferred securities are subject to issuerspecific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt instruments subjecting them to a greater risk of nonpayment may be less liquid than many other securities such as common stocks and generally offer no voting rights

legal analysis  section a of the act states in part that it is unlawful for any person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company “except pursuant to a written contract which contract whether with such registered company or with an investment adviser of such registered company has been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such registered company” rule f under the act provides that each series or class of stock in a series investment company affected by a matter must approve that matter if the act requires shareholder approval  form na is the registration statement used by openend investment companies item a of form na requires a registered investment company to disclose in its statement of additional information the method of computing the “advisory fee payable” by the investment company including the total dollar amounts that the investment company “paid to the adviser aggregated with amounts paid to affiliated advisers if any and any advisers who are not affiliated persons of the adviser under the investment advisory contract for the last three fiscal years”  rule a under the act requires proxies solicited with respect to a registered investment company to comply with schedule a under the exchange act items cii ciii c and c of schedule a taken together require a proxy statement for a shareholder meeting at which the advisory contract will be voted upon to include the “rate of compensation of the investment adviser” the “aggregate amount of the investment advisers fee” a description of the “terms of the contract to be acted upon” and if a change in the advisory fee is proposed the existing and proposed fees and the difference between the two fees  regulation sx sets forth the requirements for financial statements required to be included as part of a registered investment companys registration statement and shareholder reports filed with the commission sections a b and c of regulation sx require a registered investment company to include in its financial statement information about the investment advisory fees  section c of the act provides that the commission by order upon application may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provisions of the act or from any rule thereunder if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants state that their requested relief meets this standard for the reasons discussed below  applicants assert that the shareholders expect the advisor subject to the review and approval of the board to select the subadvisors who are in the best position to achieve the subadvised series investment objective applicants assert that from the perspective of the shareholder the role of the subadvisors is substantially equivalent to the role of the individual portfolio managers employed by an investment adviser to a traditional investment company applicants believe that permitting the advisor to perform the duties for which the shareholders of the subadvised series are paying the advisor—the selection supervision and evaluation of the subadvisors—without incurring unnecessary delays or expenses is appropriate in the interest of the subadvised series shareholders and will allow such subadvised series to operate more efficiently applicants state that each investment management agreement will continue to be fully subject to section a of the act and rule f under the act and approved by the board including a majority of the independent board members in the manner required by sections a and c of the act applicants are not seeking an exemption with respect to the investment management agreements  applicants assert that disclosure of the individual fees that the advisor would pay to the subadvisors of subadvised series that operate under the multimanager structure described in the application would not serve any meaningful purpose applicants contend that the primary reasons for requiring disclosure of individual fees paid to subadvisors are to inform shareholders of expenses to be charged by a particular subadvised series and to enable shareholders to compare the fees to those of other comparable investment companies applicants believe that the requested relief satisfies these objectives because the advisory fee paid to the advisor will be fully disclosed and therefore shareholders will know what the subadvised series fees and expenses are and will be able to compare the advisory fees a subadvised series is charged to those of other investment companies applicants assert that the requested disclosure relief would benefit shareholders of the subadvised series because it would improve the advisors ability to negotiate the fees paid to subadvisors applicants state that the advisor may be able to negotiate rates that are below a subadvisors “posted” amounts if the advisor is not required to disclose the subadvisors fees to the public applicants submit that the relief start printed page requested to use aggregate fee disclosure will encourage subadvisors to negotiate lower subadvisory fees with the advisor if the lower fees are not required to be made public  for the reasons discussed above applicants submit that the requested relief meets the standards for relief under section c of the act applicants state that the operation of the subadvised series in the manner described in the application must be approved by shareholders of a subadvised series before that subadvised series may rely on the requested relief in addition applicants state that the proposed conditions to the requested relief are designed to address any potential conflicts of interest including any posed by the use of whollyowned subadvisors and provide that shareholders are informed when new subadvisors are hired applicants assert that conditions   and  are designed to provide the board with sufficient independence and the resources and information it needs to monitor and address any conflicts of interest with affiliated persons of the advisor including whollyowned subadvisors applicants state that accordingly they believe the requested relief is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions   before a subadvised series may rely on the order requested in the

with information showing the expected impact on the profitability of the advisor  whenever a subadviser change is proposed for a subadvised series with an affiliated subadvisor or a whollyowned subadvisor the board including a majority of the independent board members will make a separate finding reflected in the board minutes that such change is in the best interests of the subadvised

are ie whether the expenses reflect redemption of shares as this information should be included in the heading before each table response��the registrants respectfully decline the staff�s request to reformat the expense example into separate tables in this round of n filings �the registrants believe the current format provides shareholders a singlepage view to compare shareholder expenses with and without redemptions �additionally invesco as recently as january   filed a n with a consolidated expense example �as the staff did not take issue with the format in that filing invesco believed this was an appropriate format to disclose this data �bifurcating the expense table may result in the tables appearing on separate pages in the proxy statementprospectus and make it more difficult for shareholders of a particular target fund to view the data relevant to their fund �in addition the change would require significant reformatting of these tables across  separate ns which would

prospectus and fund reports fact sheet  about risk derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions emerging markets securities risk emerging markets also referred to as developing markets are generally subject to greater market volatility political social and economic instability uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets in addition companies operating in emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably in addition investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs delays in settlement procedures and lack of timely information energy sector risk the fund will concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers engaged primarily in energyrelated industries changes in worldwide energy prices exploration and production spending government regulation world events economic conditions exchange rates transportation and storage costs and labor relations can affect companies in the energy sector in addition these companies are at an increased risk of civil liability and environmental damage claims and are also subject to the risk of loss from terrorism and natural disasters foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of the fund and therefore the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value small and midcapitalization risks small and midcapitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions may have little or no operating history or track record of success and may have more limited product lines and markets less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies these companies securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies and their returns may vary sometimes significantly from the overall securities market as of  ienax nav change    nas may appear
