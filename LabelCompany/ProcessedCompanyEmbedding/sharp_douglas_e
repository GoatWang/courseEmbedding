typical fantasy storyline it has a great mix of fantasy some scifi elements as well as an interesting conflict between modern day elements and those that are more ancient and magical the result is a great story that doesnt bog down when there is a lull in the action i definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes to escape reality every so often and delve into a good storycomment  people

staples or tacks used to secure the canvas are not visible the sides of the canvas are prepared and primed in the same manner as the face or front they may then be painted a solid color usually white or painted to continue the image appearing on the face this method of stretching and preparing a canvas allows for a frameless presentation of the finished painting or photograph in some competitions it is considered “framed” and ready to hang terminology in canvas printing the term “gallery wrap” refers to an image that appears on the sides of the frame as well as the front the image on the sides is either a continuation or a reflection of the main image or an otherwise fabricated element such as a solid color or colors derived from the adjacent image gallery wrap is a very popular way to display art however because the edges of the canvas are wrapped over the thick bars approximately two inches of the image top bottom and sides are not visible from the front if the subject of an image or painting is sized and positioned correctly the image will not be negatively affected however in some situations photo editing techniques are employed to fabricate additional imagematerial or to mirror existing content on the wrapped edges solid colours can also be used on the wrapped edges gallery wrap vs non gallery wrap gallery wrap is a method of displaying art wrapped over thick wooden bars so that there are no visible fasteners eg staples or tacks this method of stretching and preparing a canvas allows for a frameless presentation of the finished painting in contrast a non gallery wrap canvas is usually intended to be framed before presentation the stretcher bars are often thinner and the canvas can be secured at the sides with staples or tacks as the frame will hide them however thin stretcher bars can be found “gallery wrapped” as a hangable work without a frame   product description port douglas clean sharp port douglas clean sharp four mile beach port douglas is
