factom harmony takes on the mortgage industry  nasdaqcom hot topics etfs  smart portfolio  currencies  online broker center search factom harmony takes on the mortgage industry may    pm edt by bradley fink bitcoin magazine shutterstock photo already working with the department of homeland security and the bill  melinda gates foundation to secure records on their blockchain factom has now set its sights on the trilliondollar mortgage industry having launched its new factom harmony solution in march the company hopes to attract big banks and host their sensitive mortgage data by increasing the efficiency of document management harmony will allow a seamless transaction process between lenders and brokers without them having to worry about lost documents altered agreements or incomplete records built on the factom apollo data management solution which allows users to store and create immutable digital records harmony works with existing imaging or document management solutions to create secure transparent unalterable records for final loan documents in the process every file is secured within a blockchain container locking in the order of the final documentation recording each person who accesses files and rejecting duplicate documents factom refers to this system as a perfected digital audit vault for each specific loan thus the core product behind factom harmony is called digital vault  which locks into time the most important closing documents and gives a complete history of every file from origination to close as an allinclusive solution factom harmony creates a permanent record and index of final loan documents making audits smooth by reducing quality control due diligence and review time reduces costs by creating a single source that organizes the final documentation and provides cryptographic truth that each document is an authentic copy provides access control to multiple parties that can collaborate under audit conditions and exceptions and includes an immutable audit trail of all actions on each document in realtime giving a true history of every loan opens a secure audit room or due diligence deal room that can be tracked on the factom blockchain according to peter kirby ceo of factom inc the harmony solution and the underlying factom blockchain provide lenders with something that was fundamentally missing from the industry with harmony a lender is able to create a final set of documents for each closed loan right now origination of a loan has underlying costs of about  per loan  up from approximately  per loan in  the costs have tripled over the last few years as banks have been forced to step up their efforts to be in compliance with new laws factom harmony addresses many of the redundancy issues associated with these efforts by permanently documenting the process from the moment documents are first created and then allowing that data to be quickly shared and verified digitally having digital records that can be securely shared and verified also speeds up financial institutions ability to settle transaction among themselves factom does not claim to move money faster but it does attempt to allow others to have the confidence in the data they are reviewing and thus speed up the processes according to factom harmony is the first practical and effective deployment of blockchain technology in the mortgage industry through combining blockchain technology advanced cryptography tools and a digital fingerprint for each document or data file lenders can securely store and expose individual loan files or documents to various third parties this technology dramatically changes the approach and reduces the costs for audits thirdparty reviews litigation costs and due diligence costs jason nadeau executive vice president of factom said in a statement the combination of blockchain and digital signature technology within factoms solution creates a solution where the benefits of digital signatures and electronic vaulting are now available for all documents without having to deploy any emortgage or eclosing technology toni moss is the founder and ceo of americatalyst llc  an advisory firm located in austin texas specializing in corporate strategy business development market intelligence and market positioning for companies engaged in all sectors of the residential realestate and housing finance industry in the north american market moss has advised clients including citigroup goldman sachs deutsche bank the european commission and the kingdom of saudi arabia wellknown in the us mortgage industry she is a big fan of factom harmony and had this to say about the blockchainbased solution the industry remains disparate and fractured with regard to the acquisition management distribution and protection of data with a wide variety of thirdparty providers proprietary platforms and programming languages its just a matter of time before mortgage data is aggregated into a secure and centralized industry utility  and blockchain technology is the most promising catalyst to enable it moss said to bitcoin magazine as data becomes more plentiful accurate accessible and immutable investors will have the confidence to return to the mortgage market processing servicing and transactional costs should decrease and the market itself will be far more secure and sustainable in the longterm factom has yet to announce any contracts or partnerships related to its mortgage solution but the time is right for big banks to start utilizing blockchain technology in a separate recent development for the company the factom blockchain was made accessible to chinese developers through wancloud  a product released by wanxiang blockchain corporation to drive progress among

jul  keeping communication lines open science and technology keeping communication lines open by william bryan under secretary acting for science and technology william bryan this past week i joined my team in idaho falls idaho for jamx  this jamming exercise held at the department of energy’s idaho national laboratory gave us the opportunity to evaluate solutions to a threat that can leave responders in the dark in regard to communications—possibly escalating already dire situations the proliferation of jamming devices led us to look more closely at how they could impact responder communications last year we held an exercise in white sands new mexico to understand the problem we assessed jamming vulnerabilities to responder communications systems and published an after action report you can request a copy by contacting jammingexercisehqdhsgov building off of our work from last year jamx  focused on the technologies and tactics that can be used to thwart jamming devices in the public safety sector using test scenarios with nearly  participants from over  federal state and local public safety and private sector organizations the goal of jamx  was to help responders recognize respond to report and resolve jamming incidents by evaluating these solutions we can say with more certainty how responders can be more resilient to the threats of jamming being in idaho falls with so many men and women who are working to protect us crystallized how important it is that we bolster our capability to mitigate and overcome this threat i was grateful to be joined by us customs and border protection and the federal emergency management agency among many others on this trip when i think about the men and women who are working to protect us—in our communities at our borders and ports of entry i know how important it is that they are able to respond quickly and effectively this is an issue that is important to all of us because we all rely on their work to keep the nation safe and secure out of this exercise we look forward to bringing these entities solutions you can find more information regarding last year’s exercise can be found on dhs st’s jamming

st anniversary by tiana laurence – cmo our quest to secure the worlds systems and data has been exciting and challenging so far the simple yet powerful idea of factom has led us to travel all over the world we have been blessed to speak with leaders from almost every industry it has become clear that data and system integrity is a significant problem worth solving there is a strong need for permanent unchangeable data across both public and private sectors over the last two years we have been working hard to make factom a reality we have come a long way from our very first speech on factom by brian deery our chief scientist building revolutionary technology does not happen overnight one year ago today we launched the factom genesis network and secured the first records on the factom network these records included the declaration of human rights and the gutenberg library which includes many of the world’s famous public domain books a year later we have secured more than  million records on the factom network the basic functionality of publishing and validating data is just the beginning we are building factom so that developers can utilize permanent and unchangeable data at scale in any application the first pioneers have been datayes ancun intrinio and poloniex helping us secure stock market data notarize documents and build a digital history that developers can

security dhs science and technology directorate st today awarded  to factom inc based in austin texas to advance the security of digital identity for internet of things iot devices  the project titled “blockchain software to prove integrity of captured data from border devices” was awarded through securing the internet of things iot solicitation number hshqdcr the first call for proposals under the silicon valley innovation program svip  other transaction solicitation ots which launched in december  to encourage nontraditional performers to offer solutions to some of the toughest threats facing dhs and the homeland security mission  “iot devices are embedded within our daily lives – from the vehicle we drive to devices we wear – it’s critical to safeguard these devices from adversaries said dhs under secretary for science and technology dr reginald brothers “st is excited to engage our nation’s innovators helping us to develop novel solutions for the homeland security enterprise” the internet of things is a convergence of mobile devices information technology networks connected sensors and devices the dhs ots call for security solutions seeks novel ideas and technologies to improve situational awareness and security for protecting these domains including the  critical infrastructure sectors monitored by dhs “the startup community is already developing innovative commercial solutions for iot so why not take advantage of that” said melissa ho managing director st’s silicon valley innovation program “dhs is engaging this community to gain access to products that will have a large impact to our enterprise and we’re excited by the diversity of solutions this solicitation is able to bring to the department”     the factom inc team proposes to authenticate devices to prevent spoofing and ensure data integrity by leveraging one of the most secure networks – the blockchain factom will create an identity log that captures the identification of a device who manufactured it lists of available updates known security issues and granted authorities while adding the dimension of time for added security the goal is to limit wouldbe hackers’ abilities to corrupt the past records for a device making it more difficult to spoof for more information on future ots solicitations visit httpscitechdhsgovhsip or contact dhssiliconvalleyhqdhsgov      you are
