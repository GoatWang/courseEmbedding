historical fund and portfolio names adding deleting or substituting variable investment options we do not control the subaccounts underlying portfolios so we cannot guarantee that any of the portfolios will always be available we retain the right to change the investments of the separate account and to eliminate the shares of any subaccounts underlying portfolio and substitute shares of another series fund portfolio if the shares of an underlying portfolio are no longer available for investment or if in our judgment investment in the portfolio would be inappropriate in view of the purposes of the separate account we may add new separate account underlying portfolios or eliminate existing underlying portfolios when in our sole discretion conditions warrant a change in all of these situations we will receive any necessary sec and state approval before making any such change our separate account may be i operated as an investment management company or any other form permitted by law ii deregistered with the sec if registration is no longer required or iii combined with one or more other separate accounts to the extent permitted by law we also may transfer assets of the separate account to other accounts where permitted by applicable law we reserve the right to remove combine or add subaccounts subaccounts may be closed to new or subsequent premium payments transfers or premium allocations we will receive any necessary sec and state approval before making any of these changes we will notify you of any changes to the variable investment options resolving material conflicts underlying investment interests in addition to serving as underlying portfolios to the subaccounts the portfolios are available to registered separate accounts of other insurance companies offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts we do not currently foresee any disadvantages to you resulting from the fund companies selling portfolio shares to fund other products however there is a possibility that a material conflict of interest may arise between policy owners and the owners of variable contracts issued by other companies whose values are allocated to one of the portfolios shares of some of the portfolios may also be sold to certain qualified pension and retirement plans qualifying under section  of the internal revenue code as a result there is a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the interests of owners or owners of other contracts including contracts issued by other companies and such retirement plans or participants in such retirement plans in the event of a material conflict we will take any necessary steps to resolve the matter including removing that portfolio as an underlying investment option of the separate account the board of directors of each fund company will monitor events in order to identify any material conflicts that may arise and determine what action if any should be taken in response to those events or conflicts see the accompanying prospectuses of the portfolios for more information also see the transfers section omnibus orders fixed account investment option there is one fixed interest rate option fixed account where we bear the investment risk we guarantee that you will earn a minimum interest rate that will yield at least  per year compounded annually we may declare a higher current interest rate however you bear the risk that we will not credit more interest than will yield the minimum guaranteed rate per year for the life of the policy we have sole discretion over how assets allocated to the fixed account are invested and we bear the risk that those assets will perform better or worse than the amount of interest we have declared net premiums allocated to and transfers to the fixed account under the policy become part of our general account assets which support annuity and insurance obligations interest in the general account has not been registered with the sec and is not subject to sec regulation nor is the general account registered as an investment company with the sec the general account includes all of our assets except those assets segregated in separate accounts we have sole discretion to invest the assets of the general account subject to applicable law assets in the fixed account are subject to claims by creditors of the company the focus of this prospectus is to disclose the separate account aspects of the policy therefore sec staff have not reviewed the fixed account disclosures in this prospectus transfers the policy is designed for longterm investment not for use with professional market timing services or use with programmed large or frequent transfers excessive transfers could harm other policy owners by having a detrimental effect on investment portfolio management in addition to the right of the portfolios to impose redemption fees on shortterm trading we reserve the right to reject any specific premium allocation or transfer request if in the judgment of a subaccount portfolio fund advisor a subaccount portfolio would be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objectives and policies or if policy owners would otherwise potentially be adversely affected transferring money out of a subaccount within  days of a purchase may be considered market timing however any portfolio fund adviser may establish its own standards and each transaction may be evaluated on its own ultimately the portfolio fund adviser has the authority to make this determination prior to the annuity date you may transfer policy value from one subaccount to another from the separate account to the fixed account or from the fixed account to any subaccount subject to these rules transfer rules a transfer is considered any single request to move assets from one or more subaccounts or the fixed account to one or more of the other subaccounts or the fixed account we must receive notice of the transfer  either by written notice an authorized telephone transaction or by internet when available transfer requests by facsimile telephone or internet must be sent to us by  pm eastern time for sameday processing requests received later are processed on the next trading day fax requests must be sent to us at if requests are faxed elsewhere we will process them as of the day they are received by our trading unit the transferred amount must be at least  or the entire subaccount or fixed account value if it is less if the value remaining after a transfer will be less than  in a subaccount or  in the fixed account we will include that amount as part of the transfer  if the dollar cost averaging systematic transfer program is used then the minimum transfer amount out of a subaccount or the fixed account is the lesser of  or the balance in the subaccount or fixed account under this program the maximum amount that may be transferred from the fixed account each month is  th of the value of the fixed account at the time the dollar cost averaging program is established while a dollar cost averaging program is in effect elective transfers out of the fixed account are prohibited  the portfolio rebalancing and earnings sweep systematic transfer programs have no minimum transfer limits the first  transfers each policy year are free thereafter transfers may result in a  charge for each transfer this fee is deducted on a prorata basis from balances in all subaccounts and the fixed account it is not subtracted from the amount of the transfer transfers under any systematic transfer program do count toward the  free transfer limit a transfer from the fixed account except made pursuant to a systematic transfer program  may be made only once each policy year  may be delayed up to six months  is limited during any policy year to the greatest of   of the fixed account value on the date of the initial transfer during that year  the greatest amount of any similar transfer out of the fixed account during the previous  months or   we reserve the right to limit transfers or to modify transfer privileges and we reserve the right to change the transfer rules at any time if the policy value in any subaccount falls below  we may transfer the remaining balance without charge proportionately to the remaining investment options you selected in your latest allocation instructions we will notify you when such a transfer occurs you may within  days of the date of our notice reallocate the amount transferred without charge to another investment option in the event you authorize telephone or internet transfers we are not liable for telephone or internet instructions that we in good faith believe you authorized we will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions are genuine omnibus orders purchase and redemption orders received by the portfolios generally are omnibus orders from intermediaries such as retirement plans and separate accounts funding variable insurance products the omnibus orders reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders from individual retirement plan participants and individual owners of variable insurance products the omnibus nature of these orders may limit the ability of the portfolios to apply their respective disruptive trading policies and procedures we cannot guarantee that the portfolios will not be harmed by transfer activity relating to the retirement plans or other insurance companies that may invest in the portfolios these other insurance companies are responsible for their own policies and procedures regarding frequent transfer activity if their policies and procedures fail to successfully discourage harmful transfer activity it will affect other owners of portfolio shares as well as the owners of all variable life insurance or variable annuity contracts including ours whose variable investment options correspond to the affected portfolios in addition if a portfolio believes that an omnibus order that we submit may reflect one or more transfer requests from owners engaged in disruptive trading the portfolio may reject the entire omnibus order and thereby delay or prevent us from implementing your request disruptive trading procedures the policy is not designed to serve as a vehicle for frequent trading in response to shortterm fluctuations in the market such frequent trading programmed transfers or transfers that are large in relation to the total assets of a subaccounts underlying portfolio can disrupt management of a subaccounts underlying portfolio and raise expenses this in turn can hurt performance of an affected subaccount and therefore hurt your policys performance organizations or individuals that use market timing investment strategies and make frequent or other disruptive transfers should not purchase the policy policy owners should be aware that we are contractually obligated to provide policy owner transaction data relating to trading activities to the underlying funds on written request and on receipt of written instructions from a fund to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers by policy owners identified by an underlying fund as having engaged in transactions that violate the trading policies of the fund we reserve the right to reject or restrict in our sole discretion transfers initiated by a market timing organization or individual or other party authorized to give transfer instructions we further reserve the right to impose restrictions on transfers that we determine in our sole discretion will disadvantage or potentially hurt the rights or interests of other policy owners restrictions may include changing suspending or terminating telephone online and facsimile transfer privileges we will enforce any subaccount underlying portfolio managers restrictions imposed upon transfers considered by the manager to be disruptive our disruptive trading procedures may vary from subaccount to subaccount and may also vary due to differences in operational systems and contract provisions any subaccount restrictions will be uniformly applied there is no assurance that the measures we take will be effective in preventing market timing or other excessive transfer activity our ability to detect and deter disruptive trading and to consistently apply our disruptive trading procedures may be limited by operational systems and technological limitations the discretionary nature of our disruptive trading procedures may result in some policy owners being able to market time while other policy owners bear the harm associated with timing also because other insurance companies and retirement plans may invest in subaccount underlying portfolios we cannot guarantee that subaccount underlying portfolios will not suffer harm from disruptive trading within contracts issued by them excessive transfers we reserve the right to restrict transfers if we determine you are engaging in a pattern of transfers that may disadvantage policy owners in making this determination we will consider among other things the total dollar amount being transferred the number of transfers you make over a period of time whether your transfers follow a pattern designed to take advantage of short term market fluctuations particularly within certain subaccount underlying portfolios whether your transfers are part of a group of transfers made by a third party on behalf of individual policy owners in the group and the investment objectives andor size of the subaccount underlying portfolio third party traders we reserve the right to restrict transfers by any firm or any other third party authorized to initiate transfers on behalf of multiple policy owners if we determine such third party trader is engaging in a pattern of transfers that may disadvantage policy owners in making this determination we may among other things reject the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one policy owner or reject the transfer or exchange instructions of individual policy owners who have executed transfer forms which are submitted by market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one policy owner we will notify affected policy owners before we limit transfers modify transfer procedures or refuse to complete a transfer transfers made pursuant to participation in a dollar cost averaging portfolio rebalancing or earnings sweep program are not subject to these disruptive trading procedures see the section of this prospectus describing those programs for the rules of each program systematic transfer programs we offer several systematic transfer programs we reserve the right to alter or terminate these programs upon thirty days written notice dollar cost averaging the dollar cost averaging program allows you to automatically transfer on a periodic basis a set dollar amount or percentage from the money market subaccount or the fixed account to any other subaccounts or the fixed account requested percentages are converted to a dollar amount you can begin dollar cost averaging when you purchase the policy or later you can increase or decrease the amount or percentage of transfers or discontinue the program at any time dollar cost averaging programs are intended to limit loss and result in the purchase of more accumulation units when a portfolios value is low and fewer units when its value is high however there is no guarantee that such a program will result in a higher policy value protect against a loss

strategies and risks of the replacement portfolio and the current portfolio is included in the application  the following table compares the fees and expenses of the current portfolio and the

investment advisor cim has contractually agreed to limit direct net annual portfolio operating expenses through april   to  under the terms of the contractual expense limitation operating expenses do not include interest expense brokerage commissions taxes and extraordinary expenses only the board of directors of cvsi may terminate a portfolios expense cap before the contractual period expires the advisor further voluntarily reimbursed expenses of  or  for net operating expenses of  to maintain a positive yield during the year ended december    the applicants state that the proposed substitution is in response to a decision by the board of directors for cvsi at a meeting held on june   to approve the dissolution of the current portfolio on or about november   the “liquidation date” the boards decision to liquidate the current portfolio requires the life insurance companies to transfer accumulated contract value invested in the current portfolio to an alternative investment option available under the contracts on or before the liquidation date currently the only money market portfolio investment option offered under the contracts is the current portfolio accordingly the proposed substitution is necessary in order to provide the contract owners with continued access to a money market portfolio investment option consequently the life insurance companies have determined to replace the current portfolio with the replacement portfolio via the substitution  the life insurance companies submit that the replacement portfolio is an appropriate alternative for contract owners for several reasons first its investment objectives strategies and risks are substantially the same as those of the current portfolio second it is substantially larger than the current portfolio has had lower overall expense levels than the portfolio in recent years and has had higher yields in recent years than the current portfolio third the contracts and other variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by the life insurance companies currently offer one or more vipfv portfolios other than the replacement portfolio  the applicants believe that contract owners would benefit from the significantly larger size of the replacement portfolio and the somewhat higher yields of the replacement portfolio as contrasted start printed page with the size and recent yields of the current portfolio the yield for the current portfolio for the seven days ending december   was  the net asset value of the current portfolio was  as of december   the yield for the replacement portfolio initial class shares for the seven days ending december   was  the net asset value of the replacement portfolio supporting initial class shares was  as of december    the applicants believe that contract owners will benefit from the reduction in overall expenses of the replacement portfolio as compared to the current portfolio specifically the management fee other expenses and total operating expenses are less than those of the current portfolio both portfolios have no charge for rule b distribution and services fees the total annual operating expense of the replacement portfolio is less than that of the current portfolio given this decrease the applicants believe that the substitution would benefit contract owners by reducing the overall level of portfolio expenses legal analysis and conditions  the applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the  act approving the proposed substitution section c of the  act requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding securities of a single issuer to obtain commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust  applicants submit that the proposed substitution is not the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent section c was intended to provide for commission scrutiny of a proposed substitution which could in effect force shareholders dissatisfied with the substitute security to redeem their shares thereby possibly incurring a loss of the sales load deducted from initial premium an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption or both as well as possibly suffering adverse tax consequences upon redemption consequently the section was designed to forestall the ability of a depositor to present holders of interest in a unit investment trust with situations in which a holders only choice would be to continue an investment in an unsuitable underlying security or to elect a costly and in effect forced redemption  applicants submit that the proposed substitution will provide contract owners with substantially the same investment vehicle and would not raise any of the aforementioned concerns that congress intended to address when the  act was amended to include section c  applicants represent that redemptions and purchases will occur simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times all redemptions of shares of the current portfolio and purchases of shares of the replacement portfolio will be effected in accordance with section c of the act and rule c thereunder the substitution will take place at relative net asset value as of the effective date of the substitution “effective date” with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in the money market subaccount of the applicable account  contract values attributable to investments in the current portfolio will be transferred to the replacement portfolio without charge including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted

accounting transactional and other fees and expenses including brokerage commissions will be paid by the life insurance companies in addition the substitution will not impose any tax liability on contract owners  the applicants also represent that the substitution will not cause the contract fees and charges currently paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the substitution than before the substitution the life insurance companies will not exercise any right they may have under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers under the contracts for the period beginning on the date of the presubstitution notice defined below through at least thirty  days following the effective date  existing contract owners will be notified of the proposed substitution by means of a

under the terms of the contracts and vii inform contract owners that except as described in the market timing limitations section of the relevant prospectus the applicable life insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of the subaccount investing in the replacement portfolio for at least thirty  days after the effective date  all contract owners will have received a copy of the most recent prospectus for the replacement portfolio prior to the substitution in addition within five  days following the substitution contract owners affected by the substitution will be notified in writing that the substitution was carried out this notice will restate the relevant information set forth in the presubstitution notice and will also explain that the contract values attributable to investments in the current portfolio were transferred to the replacement portfolio without charge start printed page including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge  the applicants represent that the life insurance companies will not receive for three  years after the effective date any direct or indirect benefits from the replacement portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates in connection with assets attributable to the contracts affected by the substitution at a higher rate than the life insurance companies had received from the current portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates including without limitation b fees revenue sharing or other arrangements the applicants further represent that the substitution and the selection of the replacement portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to a life insurance company or its affiliates by the replacement portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates  applicants submit that the replacement of the current portfolio with the replacement portfolio is consistent with the protection of contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act and
