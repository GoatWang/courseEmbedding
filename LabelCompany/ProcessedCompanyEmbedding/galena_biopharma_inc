helps to clarify the capital structure of the company and should enable us to complete our strategic alternatives process” mr ghiglieri continued “thus far we have had initial interest in potential transactions from a number of companies  though this process is still evolving we are committed to updating the market as key events unfold my goal is to find the best available option or options for

discovery bay boulevarddiscovery bay california  warning letter dear dr schwartz the united states food and drug administration fda conducted an inspection of your firm galena biopharma inc located at  sw macadam avenue suite  portland oregon between november  and   the inspection focused on your firm’s compliance with postmarketing adverse drug experience pade reporting requirements and current good manufacturing practice cgmp for finished pharmaceuticals relating to abstral fentanyl sublingual tablets nda approved by fda on january   and acquired by your firm on may   and zuplenz ondansetron oral soluble film nda approved by fda on july   and acquired by your firm on august    our inspection revealed serious violations of fda’s pade reporting requirements under section k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the act  usc § k and title  code of federal regulations  cfr part  at the conclusion of the inspection your firm was issued a form fda  inspectional observations which listed instances where your firm failed to comply with pade requirements under section k of the act  usc § k and  cfr  failure to comply with section k and its corresponding regulations under  cfr  is a prohibited act under section e of the act  usc § e  we acknowledge your firm’s december   written response to the form fda  from our review of the fda establishment inspection report the documents submitted with that report and your firm’s written response we conclude that your firm did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and fda regulations governing pade reporting specific violations include but are not limited to the following     failure to develop adequate written procedures for the surveillance receipt evaluation and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experiences from all sources as required by  cfr b  your firm does not have adequate written procedures to ensure that adverse drug experiences ades are detected correctly identified assessed and reported to fda in accordance with postmarketing regulations specifically the draft standard operating procedures sops provided during the inspection “product complaints” and “post marketing reporting of serious adverse events” failed to adequately address regulatory requirements to ensure that  ade information obtained from any source is promptly conveyed to the appropriate galena biopharma inc personnel for evaluation  ades that are evaluated as day alert reports are promptly investigated and all attempts to obtain followup information about the ades are recorded as required by  cfr ciiand  an fda form a for each ade not reported as a day alert reportunder  cfr ci is submitted in the correct format and on time during the inspection your staff indicated that the initial receipt of postmarketing ades for abstral is contracted out to a call center and the call center forwards ade reports to a centralized b draft sops reviewed during the inspection require product complaints to be logged in by quality assurance staff for an investigation and cases to be created in the safety database or logged on b for special interest reports and adverse events by the pharmacovigilance staff however the sops do not include who at your firm is responsible for retrieving reports forwarded to the b from the call center how the responsible person retrieves the reports how your staff ensures that all ade information obtained by the call center was forwarded to and received by galena biopharma inc or how your staff ensure any ade obtained by the quality assurance staff during a complaint investigation is forwarded to pharmacovigilance staff  the draft “post marketing reporting of serious adverse events” sop generally references obtaining followup data from a reporter and documenting followup attempts the sop does provide vague guidelines for which reports require followup ie the report requires additional information the outcome of the event is unknown however the sop fails to adequately describe the requirement to followup on day alert reports methods used to obtain followup information the timetable for submitting followup information or how the followup information is to be reported to fda in accordance with  cfr cii in addition the draft “post marketing reporting of serious adverse events” sop states that periodic reports will be submitted “as required” this is inadequate because there is no indication of what “required” means to ensure timely periodic reporting we believe the inadequacy of these sops have contributed to your firm failing to submit any periodic adverse drug experience reports paders and associated individual case safety reports icsrs since acquiring the product abstral in your december   written response to the form fda  you included revised procedures qa “product complaints” and pv  “post marketing reporting of adverse events” and training records you noted that the revised procedures include the initial assessment and event disposition of ades the procedure for the chief medical officer evaluation of the events and the expedited reporting of day alert reports in addition your response notes that the revised procedures include a process for submitting padersyour response is inadequate the revised sop qa “product complaints” does not include procedures to follow if an ade is identified in a product complaint  therefore this written procedure fails to ensure your firm obtains ade reports from any source which includes product complaints as required by  cfr b   the revised sop pv  “post marketing reporting of adverse events” received with your december   written response includes a case creation requirement similar to what was included in the draft sop collected during the inspection however the revised sop does not specify who at your firm is responsible for obtaining reports from the call center or how the reports are retrieved by the pharmacovigilance staff for case creation  in addition the revised procedures do not provide any processes for your staff to ensure that all ade information obtained by the call center was forwarded to and received by galena biopharma inc the revised sop pv  “post marketing reporting of adverse events” lacks the steps required for the followup of day alert reports specifically it fails to describe what procedures are to be used by your staff to attempt the required followup also you do not describe your procedure for submitting postmarketing day alert followup reports to fda in accordance with  cfr cii the revised soppv  “post marketing reporting of adverse events” states that periodic reports will be submitted “as required” this is inadequate as noted previously because there is no indication of what “required” means to ensure timely periodic reporting although you committed to and submitted a periodic safety update report psur on february   in lieu of a pader with an approved waiver the lack of adequate procedures for how to submit the psurpader and associated icsrs does not prevent the possible failure to submit these reports in the future     failure to report each adverse drug experience not reported under  cfr ci at quarterly intervals as required by  cfr ci as the nda holder of abstral you are required to submit paders with icsrs to fda at quarterly intervals for three years from the nda approval date and then at annual intervals nda for abstral was originally approved on january   and subsequently transferred to your firm on may   you failed to submit ade reports in a pader or otherwise for the following periods may   through july   july   through october   and october   through january   there were at least nineteen ades reported to your firm for abstral from may   through january   in your december   written response you committed to submitting the ade reports identified as missing on or before february   however the written response is inadequate because you failed to identify why you did not submit paders with icsrs within the quarterly intervals required by regulation we also note that neither the draft sops reviewed during the inspection nor the revised sop pv  “postmarketing reporting of adverse events” submitted in your response includes any procedures for how the icsrs are to be submitted to fda the revised sop only states what will be in a psur and at what intervals the psur will be submitted therefore you have not provided adequate preventative actions to address the timely submission of periodic icsrs failure to report ades to fda at the required intervals raises concerns about your firm’s ability to monitor the safety of drug products as well as the reliability and integrity of the information submitted to fda  on february   you submitted a psur covering the period of may   to january   we acknowledge receipt of your psur however the icsrs included in the psur were not submitted in an acceptable format please refer to the fda adverse events reporting system website for instructions on how to submit icsrs electronically available online at httpwwwfdagovdrugs guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformationsurveillanceadversedrugeffectsucmhtm we emphasize our concern about the adequacy of your written procedures for the surveillance receipt evaluation and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experiences without adequate written procedures we cannot be assured that you will accurately capture and report important safety information about your drug products to the agency the violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an allinclusive statement of violations that exist at your facility it is your responsibility to ensure compliance with all requirements of federal law and fda regulations you should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice including without limitation seizure and injunction other federal agencies may take this warning letter into account when awarding contracts fda may reinspect to verify corrective actions have been completed  also we are concerned about your firm’s fundamental understanding of the overall regulatory expectations for a firm that enters into agreements with contract manufacturers to manufacture its drug products including cgmp operations under  cfr  although you have agreements with other firms that delineate specific responsibilities to each party you are ultimately responsible for the quality of your products fda is aware that many manufacturers of pharmaceutical products utilize extramural independent contract facilities and regard extramural facilities as an extension of the manufacturers own facility  cfr b regardless of who performs your operations or the agreements in place you are required to ensure your products are made in accordance with section ab of the act within fifteen working days of your receipt of this letter please notify this office in writing of the specific actions that you are taking to correct violations your response should explain how each action being taken will prevent the recurrence of similar violations as well as copies of supporting documentation if you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days state the reason for the delay and the time within which corrective actions will be completed your written response should be sent to maria p kellydoggett compliance
