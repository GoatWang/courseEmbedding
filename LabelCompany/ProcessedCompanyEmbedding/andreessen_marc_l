ama stripe has an excellent post up titled marc andreessen answers questions from stripe atlas founders andreesseen as always doesn’t disappoint see the article about him in the new yorker here are a few quick notes from the article on raising money at the seed stage when a startup is brand new the decision is driven almost entirely by the people at the venture stage when a startup has a prototype or an initial product but not yet a fully functional business the decision is some combination of the people as with seed rounds but also productmarket fit at the growth stage when a startup is fully in market and building out sales and marketing efforts to expand the decision becomes far more about the financial characteristics of the business how many pitches annually out of the  we see we will make somewhere between  and  investments per year so around a  hit rate the very best vcs in the us collectively make perhaps  investments per year out of those  about  of them will generate  of the investment returns for the entire year on saas pricing but if i were to give general advice i’d say that we see far more saas startups underpricing their product than overpricing tldr when in doubt

andreessen horowitz the venture capitalist routinely lays out “what will happen in the next ten twenty thirty years”photograph by joe puglieseon a bright october morning suhail doshi drove to silicon valley in his parents’ honda civic carrying a laptop with a twelveslide presentation that was surely worth at least fifty million dollars doshi the twentysixyearold ceo of a dataanalytics startup called mixpanel had come from san francisco to sand hill road in menlo park where many of the world’s most prestigious venturecapital firms cluster to pitch andreessen horowitz the road’s newest and most unusual firm inside the offices he stood at the head of a massive beechwood conference table to address the firm’s deal team and its seven general partners—the men who venture the money take a seat on the board and fire the entrepreneur if things go wrongmarc andreessen the firm’s cofounder fixed his gaze on doshi as he disinfected his germless hands with a sanitizing wipe andreessen is fortythree years old and six feet five inches tall with a cranium so large bald and oblong that you can’t help but think of words like “jumbo” and “grade a” two decades ago he was the animating spirit of netscape the web browser that launched the internet boom in many respects he is the quintessential silicon valley venture capitalist an imposing fortyish longcelebrated white man forbes’s midas list of the top hundred vcs includes just five women but whereas most vcs maintain a casualfriday vibe andreessen seethes with beliefs he’s an evangelist for the church of technology afire to reorder life as we know it he believes that tech products will soon erase such primitive behaviors as paying cash bitcoin eating cooked food soylent and enduring a world unimproved by virtual reality oculus vr he believes that silicon valley is mission control for mankind which is therefore on a steep trajectory toward perfection and when he so argues firehosing you with syllogisms and data points and prerefuting every potential rebuttal he’s very persuasivedoshi lean and quizzical in a maroon tshirt and jeans began his pitch by declaring “most of the world will make decisions by either guessing or using their gut they will be either lucky or wrong” far better to apply mixpanel’s analytics which enable mobilebased companies to know exactly who their customers are and how they use their apps doshi rapidly escalated to rhetoric—“we want to do data science for every single market in the world”—that would sound bumptious anywhere but on sand hill road where the young guy in jeans is obligated to astound the middleaged guys in cashmere vnecks “mediocre vcs want to see that your company has traction” doshi told me “the top vcs want you to show them you can invent the future”if you have a crackerjack idea one of your stops on sand hill road will be andreessen horowitz often referred to by its alphanumeric url az there are sixteen letters between the “a” in andreessen and the “z” in horowitz since the firm was launched six years ago it has vaulted into the top echelon of venture concerns competing vcs disturbed by its speed and its power and the lavish prices it paid for deals gave it another nickname aho each year three thousand startups approach az with a “warm intro” from someone the firm knows az invests in fifteen of those at least ten will fold three or four will prosper and one might soar to be worth more than a billion dollars—a “unicorn” in the local parlance with great luck once a decade that unicorn will become a google or a facebook and return the vc’s money a thousand times over the storied x there are eight hundred and three vc firms in the us and last year they spent fortyeight billion dollars chasing that dreamdoshi had run the gantlet before in  he tracked down andreessen and his equally if less splendidly bald cofounder ben horowitz at a ritzcarlton near tucson then he pitched them in the lobby having made sure that his parents’ honda which contained his father was well out of sight doshi mentioned that he’d become so dissatisfied with the incumbent database software that he’d built his own andreessen later told me that this “was like a cub reporter saying ‘i need to write the great american novel before i can really file this story’ ” az gave doshi ten million dollars and he gave it twentyfive per cent of his companynow he was back for more he zipped through his slides hundredpercent growth rate head count doubling every six to nine months and he still had all the money he’d raised last time as andreessen drank an iced tea in two gulps and began to roam the room doshi called up a slide that showed his competitors—localytics amplitude google analytics—grouped into quadrants then he explained how he’d crush each quadrant “i want to buy a machinelearning team i want to buy cuttingedge server hardware” he said indicating his allbutobliterated competitors he added “i want to buy stuff no one here can afford” he jammed his hands in his pockets questionswhile entrepreneurs attack with historiography—“the greatman view of history is correct and i am that great man”—vcs defend with doubletalk “you’re definitely going to get funded” means “but not by us” “who else is in” means “besides not us” and “i’m not sure i would ever use your product myself” means “so long” but the best vcs test the entrepreneur’s mettle as well as their own assumptions andreessen gripped the back of his chair “so one way to describe what you’re doing is a network effect” he said “more data gives you more customers which allows you to build more services which gives you more data which allows you to get more customers and you just turn the crank” doshi thought this over and said “sure” andreessen grinned he’s a systems thinker and he’d grasped how mixpanel fit into the system after the pitch he told me that mixpanel is “a picksandshovels business right in the middle of the gold rush”when a startup is just an idea and a few employees it looks for seedround funding when it has a product that early adopters like—or when it’s run through its seedround money—it tries to raise an a round once the product catches on it’s time for a b round and on the rounds go most vcs contemplating an investment in one of these early rounds consider the same factors “the bottom seventy per cent of vcs just go down a checklist” jordan cooper a new york entrepreneur and vc said “monthly recurring revenue founder with experience good sales pipeline x per cent of monthovermonth growth” vcs also patternmatch if the kids are into snapchat fund things like it yik yak streetchat oovoo or at a slightly deeper level if two dropouts from stanford’s computerscience phd program created google fund more stanford csp dropouts because they blend superior capacity with monetizable dissatisfactionventure capitalists with a knack for the x know that true innovations don’t follow a pattern the future is always stranger than we expect mobile phones and the internet not flying cars doug leone one of the leaders of sequoia capital by consensus silicon valley’s top firm said “the biggest outcomes come when you break your previous mental model the blackswan events of the past forty years—the pc the router the internet the iphone—nobody had theses around those so what’s useful to us is having dumbo ears” a great vc keeps his ears pricked for a disturbing story with the elements of a fairy tale this tale begins in another age which happens to be the future and features a lowborn hero who knows a secret from his hardscrabble experience the hero encounters royalty the vcs who test him and he harnesses magic technology to prevail the tale ends in heaping treasure chests for all borne home on the unicorn’s backat pitch meetings andreessen is relatively measured he reserves his passion for the deal review afterward when the firm decides whether to invest that’s where he asks questions that oblige his partners to envision a new world for the ridesharing service lyft “don’t think about how big the taxi market is what if people no longer owned cars” for offerup “what if all this selling online—ebay and craigslist—goes to mobile how big could it be” ben horowitz who sits next to his cofounder at the head of the table is an astute manager who quotes the rap lyrics of his friends nas and kanye west to inspire fearless thinking—but he doesn’t try to manage andreessen “if you say to marc ‘don’t bite somebody’s fucking head off’ that would be wrong” horowitz said “because a lot of his value when you’re making giant decisions for huge amounts of money is saying ‘why aren’t you fucking considering this and this and this’ ”“in new york we wouldn’t call this quick”az was designed to be a fullthroated argument about the future a design predicated on its founders’ comfort with conflict in  when horowitz was a netscape product manager he wrote a note to andreessen accusing him of prematurely revealing the company’s new strategy to a reporter andreessen wrote back to say that it would be horowitz’s fault if the company failed “next time do the fucking interview yourself fuck you” ordinarily relationship over “when he feels disrespected marc can cut you out of his life like a cancer” one of andreessen’s close friends said “but ben and marc fight like cats and dogs then forget about it” two years later when netscape was floundering and forty per cent of its employees left horowitz announced that he was staying no matter what andreessen had never trusted anyone before but he began to consider it their teamwork at az is complementary horowitz is the peopleperson ceo and andreessen is the farsighted theorist the chairman yet horowitz noted that “marc is much more sensitive than i am actually he’ll get upset about my body language—‘god damn it ben you look like you’re going to throw up when i’m talking about this’ ”although andreessen has been a board member of facebook hewlettpackard and ebay he doesn’t take many board seats in az’s portfolio companies preferring to train his eyes on the horizon andreessen is tomorrow’s advance man routinely laying out “what will happen in the next ten twenty thirty years” as if he were glancing at his google calendar he views his acuity as a matter of careful observation and extrapolation and often invokes william gibson’s observation “the future is already here—it’s just not very evenly distributed” jet packs have been around for half a century but you still can’t buy them at target to smooth out such lumps in distribution andreessen disseminates his views via every available podcast and panel discussion and cnn interview slot he’s a media soothsayer andreessen the magnificent he also tweets a hundred and ten times a day inundating his three hundred and ten thousand followers with aphorisms and statistics and tweetstorm jeremiads andreessen says that he loves twitter because “reporters are obsessed with it it’s like a tube and i have loudspeakers installed in every reporting cubicle around the world” he believes that if you say it often enough and insistently enough it will come—a glorious revenge he told me “we have this theory of nerd nation of forty or fifty million people all over the world who believe that other nerds have more in common with them than the people in their own country so you get to choose what tribe or band or group you’re a part of” the nationstates of twitter will map the worldmixpanel was emblematic of silicon valley’s outsized worship of unicorns at the company’s deal review peter levine who sits on doshi’s board reported that the entrepreneur had emailed to say that he’d love for his company to be valued at a billion dollars—an assessment that would set the price for the portion of it that az might now buy however doshi would sell the firm ten per cent of his company for eighty million suggesting a valuation of eight hundred million dollars andreessen said “the dogs are fucking jumping through the screen door to eat the dog food and he hasn’t done any marketing yet and he’s profitable”horowitz exclaimed “how old is he twentyfour god damn it let’s give him all our money” az provided doshi all his bround funding—sixtyfive million dollars—for a further  per cent of the company which was thus valued at eight hundred and sixtyfive million dollars doshi was a little sorry that mixpanel wasn’t valued at a billion dollars but he told me that he could wait his business was growing so fast and everyone was raising money so frequently in the current boom that “in six or twelve months we’ll be a unicorn”venture firms rarely do an entire followon round themselves for fear of losing sight of a company’s true market value as andreessen put it “you can be thinking your shit smells like ice cream” none of the halfdozen other firms that doshi pitched last fall valued his company as highly as az did but andreessen applied a maxim from his friend and intellectual sparring partner peter thiel who cofounded paypal and was an early investor in linkedin and yelp when a reputable venture firm leads two consecutive rounds of investment in a company andreessen told me thiel believes that that is “a screaming buy signal and the bigger the markup on the last round the more undervalued the company is” thiel’s point which takes a moment to digest is that when a company grows extremely rapidly even its bullish vcs having recently set a relatively low value on the previous round will be slightly stuck in the past the faster the growth the farther behind they’ll be andreessen grinned appreciating the paradox the more they paid for mixpanel—according to thiel anyway—the better a deal they’d be gettingmost businesses don’t work like this at least not yetsilicon valley the fifteenhundred squaremile shelf an hour south of san francisco was called the santa clara valley until the rise of the microprocessor in the nineteenseventies it remains contested ground armies of startups attack every incumbent with early employees—and sometimes even their lawyers and landlords—taking deferred compensation in the hope that their options and warrants will pay off down the line yet workers’ loyalty is not to a company or even to an idea but to the iterative promise of the region “uber is built on the efforts of thousands of people in the valley” the investor naval ravikant said “on the back of the iphone and android and gps and battery technology and online creditcard payments all stacked on themselves”vcs give the valley its continuity—and its ammunition they are the arms merchants who can turn your crazy idea and your expendable youth into a team of coders with thunderbolt monitors apple and microsoft got started with venture money so did starbucks the home depot whole foods market and jetblue vcs made their key introductions and stole from every page of sun tzu to help them penetrate markets and yet vcs maintain a zone of embarrassed privacy around their activities they tell strangers they’re investors or work in technology because in a valley that valorizes the entrepreneur they don’t want to be seen as just the money “i say i’m in the software industry” one of the valley’s bestknown vcs told me “i’m ashamed of the truth”at a hundred and eleven dollars a square foot sand hill road is america’s most expensive officerental market—an oakandeucalyptuslined prospect stippled with bland twostory ski chalets constrained by an ethos of nonconspicuous consumption except for the teslas in the parking lot it’s a community of paranoid optimists the top firms coöperate and compete by turns suspicious of any company whose previous round wasn’t led by another topfive firm even as they’re jealous of that firm for leading it they call this schadenfreuderiddled relationship “coopitition” firms trumpet their boldness yet they often follow one another lemminglike pursuing the latest innovation—penbased computers biotech interactive television superconductors clean tech—off a cliffventure capital became a profession here when an investor named arthur rock bankrolled intel in  intel’s cofounder gordon moore coined the phrase “vulture capital” because vcs could pick you clean semiretired millionaires who routinely arrived late for pitch meetings they’d take half your company and replace you with a ceo of their choosing—if you were lucky but vcs can also anoint you the imprimatur of a top firm’s investment is so powerful that entrepreneurs routinely accept a twentyfive per cent lower valuation to get it patrick collison a cofounder of the onlinepayment company stripe says that landing sequoia peter thiel and az as seed investors “was a signal that was not lost on the banks we wanted to work with” laughing he noted that the valuation in the next round of funding—“for a prelaunch company from very untested entrepreneurs who had very few customers”—was a hundred million dollars stewart butterfield a cofounder of the officemessaging app slack told me “it’s hard to overestimate how much the perception of the quality of the vc firm you’re with matters—the signal it sends to other vcs to potential employees to customers to the tech press it’s like where you went to college”a venture firm musters its ammunition—say a fund of a hundred and fifty million dollars—by recruiting investors such as university endowments and pension funds to become “limited partners” or lps in the fund the firm invests the money for three or four years then harvests the returns for the remainder of the fund’s tenyear term in theory vcs like entrepreneurs are motivated by delayed gratification the standard fee is “two and twenty” two per cent of the fund each year and twenty per cent of the ultimate profits the top firms including az charge thirty per cent lps expect returns equal to at least those they’d get in the stock market plus an additional five per cent for the illiquidity of the investment for top firms the dream is x to xat the moment venture funding accounts for less than  per cent of the us’s gdp “venture is often called a rounding error in the economy” herbert allen iii the head of the investment bank allen  company said “but the bang for the buck is huge and venture is a major source of the optimism that underlies the american myth” venture speeds the cycle of american impatience what exists is bad and what replaces it is good—until the new thing itself must be supplantedcorporate culture civic responsibility becoming a pillar of society—these are not venture’s concerns andy weissman a partner at new york’s union square ventures noted that venture in the valley is a perfect embodiment of the capitalist dynamic that the economist joseph schumpeter called “creative destruction” weissman said “silicon valley vcs are all technooptimists they have the arrogant belief that you can take a geography and remove all obstructions and have nothing but a free flow of capital and ideas and that it’s good it’s very good to creatively destroy everything that has gone before” some silicon valley vcs believe that these values would have greater sway if their community left america behind andreessen’s nerd nation with a charter and a geographic locale peter thiel favors “seasteading” establishing floating cities in the middle of the ocean balaji srinivasan until recently a general partner at az and now the chairman of one of its bitcoin companies has called for the “ultimate exit” arguing that the united states is as fossilized as microsoft and that the valley has become stronger than boston new york los angeles and washington dc combined srinivasan believes that its denizens should “build an optin society ultimately outside the us run by technology”the game in silicon valley while it remains part of california is not ferocious intelligence or a contrarian investment thesis everyone has that it’s not even wealth anyone can become a billionaire just by rooming with mark zuckerberg it’s prescience and then it’s removing every obstacle to the ferocious clarity of your vision incumbents regulations folkways people can you not just see the future but summon itmarc andreessen mentions thomas edison often his family never when he was growing up outside the nostoplight town of new lisbon wisconsin his father lowell was a sales manager for a seed company called pioneer hibred international and his mother pat worked in customer service at lands’ end—but i didn’t get that information from him a friend who knows andreessen well told me “we’ve never had a conversation about his parents or his brother—all he said was ‘they didn’t like me and i didn’t like them all that much either’ ”the few details andreessen let slip to me suggested a climate of antiquity superstition frustration and penury “the natural state of human beings is to be subsistence farmers and that was my expectation” he said adding that his world was “scandinavian hardcore very selfdenying people who go through life never expecting to be happy” the family telephone was a party line and the bathroom at his relatives’ farm was an outhouse everyone believed in dowsing and the weather reports in the farmers’ almanac one winter with money tight his father decided to stop paying for gas heat “and we spent a great deal of time chopping fucking wood” the local movie theatre one town over was an unheated room that doubled as a fertilizerstorage depot andreessen wore a puffy pioneer hibred coat to watch “star wars” while sitting on the makings of a huge bomb he had to drive an hour to find a waldenbooks in la crosse it was all cookbooks and cat calendars so he later saw amazon as a heroic disseminator of knowledge and progress “screw the independent bookstores” he told me “there weren’t any near where i grew up there were only ones in college towns the rest of us could go pound sand”andreessen’s vision of the future and of his escape route came from television he told me “kitt the car in ‘knight rider’ was a computer that could analyze a poisongas attack the car was magic—but now you can actually do all those things a new car isn’t kitt but it does have all the maps and all the music in the world and it talks to you even the transporter beam in ‘star trek’ basically makes sense if you understand quantum entanglement people are composed of quantum elements so there is a path”something of the transporter beam clings to andreessen a sense that he just rematerialized from a city on the edge of forever he’s not great at the basics of daily life directions confound him because roadways aren’t logical and he’s so absentminded about sunglasses that he keeps a “reload station” with nine pairs on his hall table perhaps edison haunts his conversation because andreessen is a fellowtinkerer except that his gadgets are systems and platforms and his workshop is his own mind he regularly reprograms his appearance and deportment—his user interface—to suit his present role and friends refer to chapters in his life as versions of an operating system “marc ” “marc ” and so on a charismatic introvert andreessen draws people in but doesn’t really want them around though he has a crisp sense of humor it’s rarely deployed at his own expense he hates being complimented looked at or embraced and has toyed with the idea of wearing a tshirt that says “no hugging no touching” he doesn’t grasp the protocols of social chitchat and prefers getting a memo to which he can email a response typing at a hundred and forty words a minute he didn’t attend netscape’s twentiethanniversary celebration because it combined two things from which he recoils parties and reminiscingyet he’s also energetic and decisive which makes him a valued counsellor in  yahoo offered to buy facebook for a billion dollars and accel partners facebook’s lead investor urged mark zuckerberg to accept andreessen said “every single person involved in facebook wanted mark to take the yahoo offer the psychological pressure they put on this twentytwoyearold was intense mark and i really bonded in that period because i told him ‘don’t sell don’t sell don’t sell’ ” zuckerberg told me “marc has this really deep belief that when companies are executing well on their vision they can have a much bigger effect on the world than people think not just as a business but as a steward of humanity—if they have the time to execute” he didn’t sell facebook is now worth two hundred and eighteen billion dollarsandreessen’s range of reference extends from ibn khaldun to “south park” yet he approaches new topics as if starved eating through men’s fashion or whiskeymaking or congressional politics until it has yielded every micronutrient in a tweetstorm about the question of net neutrality he observed that anyone who took a position should be versed in the “history technology and economics of backbones interconnection agreement peering cdns caching colocation current and future telco and cable business models including capex and opex models rate caps cost of capital return on investment” as well as a dozen other equally abstruse matters he coyly noted that no one himself included understood them all—then stated his position andreessen’s learning fuses the idiosyncrasy of the autodidact with the thoroughness of what programmers call depthfirst search “i could never tolerate not knowing why” he said “you have to work your way back to figure out the politics the motivations i always stop when i get to evolutionary psychology and why we have tribes—oh ok we’re primates cursed with emotions and the ability to do logical thinking” he keeps rediscovering that we’re australopithecines and keeps hoping to transform us into homo habilis man the tool user able manto this end he addresses any topic such as google’s purchase of the thermostat maker nest by launching a dialectics—“ either nest is the most amazing company ever or  larry page acquihired tony fadell for  billion and got a thermostat business on the side”—whose synthesis is often that the thesis and the antithesis were simplistic “or maybe google has a larger plan for automating the home” or irrelevant “whatever whatever we don’t own it so who cares” often he discourses at such lucid length that his cheeks redden and he must pause for breath if you seize the interval to demonstrate a basic grasp of his argument he’ll say “exzactly” with a pleased smile and upload another tranche what saves him from pompous knowitalldom most of the time is this eagerness to communicatehe turns to theory the way a drinker turns to the minibar but horowitz told me that every once in a while andreessen will “get all wisconsin on you sticking up for his people when we looked at an internet pawnshop people here said ‘it’s immoral’ and marc went bananas he said ‘if you’ve got no fucking money and you need to pawn your watch to pay for your kids to eat—you think that’s morally fucking wrong because it offends your sensibilities you rich motherfuckers’ he knew that guy who was pawning his watch because he’d missed the harvest or whatever or we saw an uberforprivatejets thing or some wine thing that came through and he just got incensed ‘we didn’t start the firm for rich people to buy hundreddollar bottles of wine or to fly around on fucking private jets’ he reminds me of kanye that level of emotional intensity—his childhood was so intensely bad he just won’t go there”one afternoon alexis ringwald the ceo of learnup a jobtraining startup that has worked with staples and old navy stood in az’s conference room all poise and smile “i like to launch movements to tackle huge problems” she said launching into her presentation“start at the beginning where you grew up” ben horowitz said az had made a small seed investment in ringwald’s company but most of the general partners who were about to tell her whether she was ready for an a round didn’t know much about her horowitz also routinely forces a founder to abandon her script and regroup it’s a stress test intended to elicit biography resilience and the real story“how many times do i have to tell you to stay inside the bowl”ringwald who is thirtyone blinked then shifted smoothly to an engaging account of her early years her work interviewing people on the unemployment line and how she’d eventually realized that the country’s biggest gulf is between those who have the basic skills to be employable—showing up on time dressing neatly—and those who don’t “so it’s a modern ‘my fair lady’ sort of thing” horowitz asked ingenuously ringwald crisply noted that her process triples an applicant’s chance of getting a job and that eightytwo per cent of learnup’s trainees outperform their fellowworkers horowitz and andreessen nodded she could handle the pressure afterward horowitz told me “my big conclusion was she’s a legit pied piper with charisma and will and fury”pitch meetings are minefields if a vc asks you “when you get to a hundred engineers are you worried about the company culture or excited” the correct answer is “a hundred i want a thousand” reid hoffman a vc at greylock partners who cofounded linkedin told me “i look to see if someone has a marine strategy for taking the beach an army strategy for taking the country and a police strategy for governing the country afterward”az wants to learn if the founder has a secret—a novel insight drawn from personal experience about how the world could be better arranged if that new arrangement is x better consumers might be won over balaji srinivasan contributed the concept of the “idea maze” you want the entrepreneur to have spent years thinking her idea into—and out of—every conceivable dead end “entrepreneurs want to raise money from us” andreessen told me “so the natural thing when we say ‘what if you did this’ is to tell us what we want to hear but we don’t want to hear what we want to hear it’s a delight when they look at you with contempt—you idiot—and then walk you through the idea maze and explain why your idea won’t work” such tests help az determine whether the founder is a mercenary who wants to sell the company within four years which will cap az’s return at x or a missionary determined to change the world “at the same time” andreessen said “we’re not funding mother teresa we’re funding imperial willtopower people who want to crush their competition companies can only have a big impact on the world if they get big”ringwald back into her planned remarks promised bigness “learnup will transform employment in america we can unleash human potential and move the needle on the gdp” andreessen said “question this is a known problem why do companies not just do this themselves once they see that it works” ringwald replied “we’ll keep on differentiating by moving fast and collecting more data on what companies need now”then a general partner named chris dixon asked “is it a marketplace or an enterprise company” marketplace companies sell to consumers enterprise companies sell to other businesses clearly perplexed by the distinction ringwald said that she was signing up workers as well as companies everyone became a shade more remoteafterward andreessen told his colleagues “she didn’t really answer chris’s question if it’s marketplace it’s defensible if it’s enterprise she can be undercut” if ringwald’s customers were the workers who would keep using learnup as they moved from job to job she could create a network effect if her customers were actually the companies they could start doing the training themselves—or another startup could az views marketplace and enterprise companies very differently the firm invests early with enterprise but waits with consumer companies because they tend to take off—suddenly everyone wants to be on instagram—or fail fast it’s a riskaverse way to embrace risk in  az passed on the a round of oculus vr waiting to see if it could resolve the nausea issue that has plagued virtualreality systems and came in on the b six months later it got the same ten per cent of the company it could have had in the a—but it paid thirty million dollars instead of six million the internal rationale for this expensive “derisking” is “we paid up for certainty”the partners began to discuss how learnup might be valued valuation particularly in a company’s early rounds often derives less from spreadsheets than from market forces—what are other firms offering—and the “what if”s of mental modelling does the company’s traction leadership team and “total addressable market” call to mind a pinterest or does it feel more like a shoedazzle one partner suggested that learnup was a “ten on thirty”—ten million dollars should buy a third of the company which would then be valued at forty million “it’s more like ten on fifteen or twenty” horowitz said cutting the company’s value in half “or six on twelve” andreessen said whittling it further soon after the meeting ringwald turned learnup into an enterprise companymost venture firms operate as a guild each partner works with his own companies and a small shared staff helps with business development and recruiting az introduced a new model the venture company its general partners make about three hundred thousand dollars a year far less than the industry standard of at least a million dollars and the savings pays for sixtyfive specialists in executive talent tech talent market development corporate development and marketing az maintains a network of twenty thousand contacts and brings two thousand established companies a year to its executive briefing center to meet its startups which has produced a pipeline of deals worth three billion dollars andreessen told me “we give our founders the networking superpower hyperaccelerating someone into a fully functional ceo in five years”the firm’s fourteenperson deal team also enables it to rapidly assess any new technology making az a kind of iron man suit for andreessen as he pursues his flights of fancy jim breyer who led facebook’s first venture round at accel partners told me “i spend most of my time trying to connect the dots for what the future will look like in five to seven years but i don’t believe i scale as well as marc and ben and their team they’ve moved into nextgen agricultural products and wearables and drone software where a lot of us don’t have expertise or networks”andreessen and horowitz launched the firm in  when venture investment was frozen by the recession their strategy was shaped by their friend andy rachleff a former vc he told them that he’d run the numbers and that fifteen technology companies a year reach a hundred million dollars in annual revenue—and they account for ninetyeight per cent of the market capitalization of companies that go public so az had to get those fifteen companies to pitch them “deal flow is everything ” andreessen told me “if you’re in a secondtier firm you never get a chance at that great company” a leading investment banker who has taken numerous software companies public told me “i put ninety per cent of my effort into seeking out deals from the top eight venture firms ten per cent into the next twelve and zero per cent into all the rest”the dirty secret of the trade is that the bottom threequarters of venture firms didn’t beat the nasdaq for the past five years in a stinging  report the lp diane mulcahy calculated “since  less cash has been returned to vc investors than they have invested” the truth is that most vcs subsist entirely on fees which they compound by raising a new fund every three years returns are kept hidden by nondisclosure agreements and so vcs routinely overstate them both to encourage investment and to attract entrepreneurs “you can’t find a venture fund anywhere that’s not in the top quartile” one lp said sardonically vcs also logo shop buying into late rounds of hot companies at high prices so they can list them on their portfolio pagewhen az began it didn’t have even an ersatz track record to promote so andreessen and horowitz consulted on tactics with their friend michael ovitz who cofounded the hollywood talent agency creative artists agency in  ovitz told me that he’d advised them to distinguish themselves by treating the entrepreneur as a client “take the long view of your platform rather than a transactional one call everyone a partner offer services the others don’t and help people who aren’t your clients disrupt to differentiate by becoming a dreamexecution machine”believing that founders make the best ceos—look at intel apple oracle google facebook—andreessen and horowitz recruited only general partners who’d been founders or run companies then they began constructing the illusion of authority taking offices on sand hill road and filling them with paintings by robert rauschenberg and sol lewitt—another page from the book of ovitz who commissioned a roy lichtenstein painting for caa’s lobby that was so large the firm had to leave it behind when it moved they were studiously punctual partners are fined ten dollars for each minute they’re late to a pitch used glassware rather than plastic and said no quickly and explained why unless the reason was doubts about the entrepreneur in a handwritten note and while most vcs were publicity averse—sequoia’s slogan was “the entrepreneurs behind the entrepreneurs”—az banged the drum to draw startups the tech publicist margit wennmachers built an eightperson marketing department and helped to orchestrate stories in forbes and fortune“they all lead back to this ball of yarn”andreessen and horowitz believed that it would take them years to get great deal flow so instead of fighting for around financings—the most competitive round because it’s when you can buy the largest chunk of an upandcoming company—they planned to make seed investments in eighty startups they wouldn’t take the customary board seats otherwise they’d each be sitting on forty boards but they’d help all eighty companies and then lead the a round for the twelve bestthe strategy had flaws entrepreneurs want vcs on their boards and so do lps that’s how you really learn a company the firm would be sending a huge negative signal about companies it didn’t reinvest in—hardly an entrepreneurfriendly stance furthermore by making so many investments az would create significant opportunity costs in its first year it put two hundred and fifty thousand dollars into a company called burbn which soon pivoted and became instagram—but az couldn’t increase its share because it had also taken a position in a shortlived photo app called picplz though the firm made x when facebook bought instagram the huge multiple amounted to only seventyeight million dollars elizabeth obershaw a managing director at horsley bridge a prominent lp that invested in az after some debate told me “our list of cons was that we didn’t think their original model would work at all the pros were marc and ben—we decided they were learners and adapters and would realize the model wasn’t workable fast enough to fix it—and an industry that was ripe for reinvention”they learned fast after az raised a threehundredmilliondollar fund and opened shop in july  it did a lot of seed rounds but it also spent fifty million dollars to buy three per cent of skype two years later microsoft bought skype and the investment returned x andreessen believed that everyone had underestimated the size of the internet market so in  after raising a much bigger second fund the firm spent a hundred and thirty million dollars to acquire shares of facebook and twitter at unprecedented valuations other vcs sniped that az was trying to buy its way in skype was an established company not a startup and the facebook and twitter deals were mere logo shopping but as ron conway silicon valley’s leading angel investor noted “in twentyfour months andreessen horowitz was the talk of the town” the firm won a hundredmilliondollar a round for the coding company github which conway called “the most hotly contested deal in five years” chris wanstrath github’s cofounder and ceo said that az’s services were a major attraction “it’s like a buffet—they offered a bunch of great dishes and we wanted to sample them all”after six years andreessen believes az is meeting—and winning—enough new clients to place it “comfortably in the top three” vc firms this is not far off from the consensus in the valley its first fund has already returned x and contains such powerhouses as slack and the identitymanagement company okta the fund’s internal rate of return a calculation of annualized profit is fifty per cent which places it very high among funds raised in  sequoia’s rate for its corresponding fund is sixtynine per cent the firm’s second fund includes pinterest and airbnb and its third fund includes zenefits github and mixpanel both funds on paper are well into the black a respected lp of the firm told me “they’re one of our top performers” yet andreessen cautioned “we still have a lot to prove on returns i wouldn’t be comfortable saying we’re no  until ten years have passed maybe fifteen until then it’s schrödinger’s cat and i’ve got really good arguments on why the cats are both alive and dead”at andreessen’s wedding in  ben horowitz said in his toast that the man he’d long known was “grouchy marc” because he’d “gone through his whole life without anyone understanding him being all by himself” no one had understood him in his farm town no one had understood him in silicon valley—“hell i do not understand him” but now at last he was “happy marc” because he’d found “someone who totally gets him” the bride a lecturer in philanthropy at stanford’s business school named laura arrillagaandreessenin december andreessen invited me to their house in atherton five minutes from az’s office to watch television he and laura live in a modern artfilled ninethousandsquarefoot villa built in a style that she calls “northern california pastiche” the ceilings are scaled to andreessen’s brobdingnagian proportions and everything is majestic minimal and new the toilet in the powder room is so visionary and the surrounding dimmer lights so flattering that i had to study it for some time to figure out how it flushedarrillagaandreessen brought the couple’s dinners into the living room and placed them on matching costco tv tables the omelettes and thai salads that their chef had prepared earlier had been freshly reheated they have three microwaves so their food will always be ready at the same time andreessen stroked her arm and beamed “hello gorgeous”“hello my darling” she replied then she gave me a dramatic hug as we hadn’t seen each other since the previous day arrillagaandreessen is a tall etherealseeming yet effusive woman when the couple met in  at a new year’s eve dinner thrown by the leading investor in eharmony they talked for six and a half hours she told me that andreessen satisfied most of the criteria on her checklist he was a genius he was a coder he was funny and he was bald “i find it incredibly sexy to see the encasement of a cerebrum” she explained for his part andreessen felt that “she was spectacular my biggest concern was that she wanted to live a jetset life” in one of the seventeen emails he sent her the next day he asked “what’s your ideal evening” she responded “stay home do email make an omelette watch tv take a bath go to bed” before their second date he delivered what she calls “a twentyfiveminute monologue on why we should go steady with a full intellectual decision tree in anticipation of my own decision tree” they were married nine months later in her and her father john a billionaire silicon valley developer andreessen seems to have found a replacement family laura showed me a photograph of the two men side by side both bald selfmade and magisterial “quite two peas in a pod”after some tv time together the couple reads in bed so that she says “i can fall asleep holding my beloved” she invariably refers to her husband as “my beloved” rather than “marc” “i ask him questions about things i got curious about during the day so every night i’m going to sleep with a human wikipedia that can go deeper and deeper and deeper link upon link in the past week we talked about all the hardware components of a mobile phone how binary code works what might happen with drone regulation and whether putin is using ukraine as a distraction from the financial crisis in russia” once she’s dozed off andreessen returns to work in his home office where like a recharging cell phone he gains energy through the nighthe pushed a button to unroll the wall screen then called up apple tv we were going to watch the final two episodes of the first season of the amc drama “halt and catch fire” about a fictional company called cardiff which enters the personalcomputer wars of the early eighties the show’s resonance for andreessen was plain in  he said “i was twelve and i didn’t know anything about startups or venture capital but i knew all the products” he used the school library’s radio shack trs to build a calculator for math homework in  as an undergraduate at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign he neglected his job—writing unix code for  an hour—to team with another programmer to create mosaic the first graphical browser for the web after graduating he moved to silicon valley where he and a volatile serial entrepreneur named jim clark launched netscape to make the internet available not just to scientists but to everyone john doerr the vc who funded their a round said that the genius of their browser was that “it was like putting photos on the menu at howard johnson you didn’t need to know the language you could just point” the story underlying that story arrillagaandreessen told me—the secret—was that “netscape was based on my beloved’s own inability as a child to access knowledge in a small town”netscape navigator released in  quickly claimed more than ninety per cent of the browser market and andreessen predicted that the web would make operating systems such as microsoft’s windows “irrelevant” when the company went public in  its stock rocketed from twentyeight dollars a share to seventyfive dollars and andreessen was soon on the cover of time barefoot on a throne but marc  was very much in beta having given up coding his first love to manage coders he scarfed pepperidge farm nantuckets and honeycomb cereal straight from the box skipped meetings and blazed up without warning “you’d see him vibrating and it would inspire a combination of excitement and terror” jason rosenthal a manager whom andreessen actually liked recalled a favorite andreessen response to underlings’ confusion was “there are no stupid questions only stupid people” jim barksdale the company’s ceo said “i’d tell marc after meetings ‘you don’t have to tell a dumb sumbitch he’s a dumb sumbitch’ ” andreessen told me “i needed netscape to work it had to work—it was my oneway door—so i was absolutely intolerant of anything that got in the way”—meaning he clarified “people” he could never relax “i am very paranoid and the down cycle hurt a lot more than the up cycle felt good”the down cycle began when microsoft bundled its own browser with its operating system making it the nation’s browser of convenience if not of choice netscape shifted from marketplace to enterprise and began selling browser and server software but it was fortunate to get bought by aol in  for ten billion dollars peter currie the company’s cfo said “we made a difference we invented cookies and pioneered downloading software from the internet yet netscape is an asterisk in business history maybe the best way to think about it is as a classic tech story a company creates invents succeeds—and gets bypassed”in the first “halt and catch fire” episode cardiff’s entrepreneurs go to comdex the big trade show and discover that another company has stolen their idea and beaten them to market in response gordon the hardware engineer removes the interactive operating system from their cardiff machine—a system designed by cameron a punk female software prodigy—and slots in microsoft’s dos which makes the machine ibmcompatible viable and dull it was an excruciating capitulation but andreessen nodded evenly “this was microsoft’s moment and gordon is right—they need to live to fight another day but   ” he pointed at the screen where apple’s macintosh was making its début at the trade show “hello i’m macintosh” the machine said andreessen laughed and continued “they were doomed from the start because apple in cupertino”—in silicon valley—“had spent three years building that i’ve been totally determined to be on the other side of that dynamic by being here because success in software follows a powerlaw distribution it’s not coke and pepsi and a bunch of others it’s winner take all second prize is a set of steak knives and third prize is you’re fired”in the season finale cameron launches her own startup as andreessen watched her manage her coders he said softly “the best scenes with cameron were when she was alone in the basement coding” i said i felt that she was the least satisfactory character underwritten inconsistent lacking in plausible motivation he smiled and replied “because she’s the future”in “why software is eating the world” a widely invoked  oped in the wall street journal andreessen put the most optimistic spin on silicon valley’s tendencies the article proclaimed that tech companies are consuming vast swaths of the economy from books and movies to financial services to agriculture to national defense—which andreessen saw as the healthful scavenging of a carrion way of life on twitter he pursued the theme “posit a world in which all material needs are provided free by robots and material synthesizers    imagine six or  billion people doing nothing but arts and sciences culture and exploring and learning what a world that would be” particularly as “technological progress is precisely what makes a strong rigorous social safety net affordable”andreessen’s telepathic method—extrapolating the future from current trends—may be the best available but it has had doubtful results of the eighteen firms that vcs valued at more than a billion dollars in the heady days of  eleven have gone out of business or have been liquidated in fire sales including home etoys and webvan az bought into zulily an online marketer at a valuation of a billion dollars it soared to a market capitalization of five billion dollars and has since slumped to  billion another billiondollar az company the bargainshopping site fab recently sold for about thirty million dollars on the other hand the firm wrote off the gaming company slack to zero—and then it became an officemessaging app that’s now valued at  billionthe random contingent way that the future comes to pass is a source of endless frustration in the valley sam altman the president of the startup incubator y combinator notes that his early investment in stripe is now worth on paper more than x “so ninetyseven per cent of my returns from  and  are concentrated in one investment which i could easily have missed” he said “i only let myself think about this sort of thing on vacation because if i acknowledged that i was wasting more than ninety per cent of my time—which is true from an economic perspective—i couldn’t get through my days”the key to investing andreessen contends is to be aggressive and to fight your instinct to patternmatch “breakthrough ideas look crazy nuts” he said adding “it’s hard to think this way—i see it in other people’s body language and i can feel it in my own where i sometimes feel like i don’t even care if it’s going to work i can’t take more change” andreessen believes that the major barrier to change is sociological people can embrace only so many new ideas at once “ok google ok twitter—but airbnb people staying in each other’s houses without there being a lot of axe murders”az passed on airbnb’s a round in  reid hoffman the greylock vc who led that round and who is a friend of andreessen’s said “once something like airbnb gets going marc can get a very good sense of it of the economic system—but he’s not necessarily as good at the psychology of why it would get going in the first place”brian chesky airbnb’s cofounder and ceo told me “in  when we were starting to get some traction marc and ben did a oneeighty and were very humble marc said he now saw it through the lens of ebay buying stuff from strangers” az led airbnb’s b round soon afterward the company was battered by headlines about renters who trashed a san francisco home it wasn’t axe murders but chesky said “it was a pr nightmare we had just expanded from being ten people living in a threebedroom apartment and we had no idea how to be a billiondollar company marc came to our office at midnight and read the letter i’d written to our community about the airbnb guarantee and the two changes he made changed the company forever i’d said we guarantee five thousand dollars for property damage and he added a zero which seemed crazy” andreessen also added the proviso that claimants would have to file a police report which he correctly believed would discourage scam artists “and he told me to add my personal email address he gave us permission to be bold”in venture it’s not batting average that matters it’s slugging average boldness is all when google glass appeared az joined a collective to seek out investments and andreessen declared that without the face shield “people are going to find they feel basically naked and lonely” google withdrew the product in january but he would argue so what his thesis is that such az failures as fab and rockmelt and digg and kno are not merely a tolerable byproduct of the risk algorithm but a vital indicator of it it’s fine to have a lousy record of predicting the future most of the time as long as when you’re right you’re really right between  and  a mere  per cent of all venture investments returned at least x the real mistakes aren’t the errors of commission the companies that crash—all you can lose is your investment—but those of omission there were good reasons that az passed on buying twelve per cent of uber in  including a deadline of just hours to make a decision but the firm missed a profit on paper of more than three billion dollarsthe beauty of betting on risky technologies is that you’re sometimes proved right eventually—perhaps we’ll all feel naked without google glass  when reverses occur andreessen tends to believe that he wasn’t wrong so much as overly prescient yet while he professes intellectual comfort with being wrong he never mentions ning a socialnetworking company that he cofounded in  because as he conceded when i asked about the elision “it didn’t do great” and he can be touchy about criticism at one q  a i attended when the interviewer read him a snarky quote from sam biddle a writer who worked for the gossip site valleywag andreessen made a doobiesmoking gesture and plunged an imaginary needle into his vein to suggest the quality of biddle’s thinking being the public face of venture means that you can be challenged on multiple fronts even as you philosophize about ushering in a new age of democracy you also have to make money for your lps and while the ideal startup advances both goals most in truth advance neither the vc bryce roberts told me “it’s an ego game where you want to believe you’re changing the world but how can you write a check to fab and believe that giving people discounted tchotchkes is changing the world”“you two are fired as security guards now gather up your things and escort each other from the building”in  andreessen and horowitz started loudcloud an early cloudcomputing service that booked thirtyseven million dollars in contracts in its first nine months andreessen meanwhile was becoming marc  he shed thirty pounds started wearing ermenegildo zegna suits and traded in his red mustang for a white mercedes “marc  was jim clark” andreessen told me referring to his impulsive cofounder “marc  was trying to get as polished as possible more socialized and marc  is a combo the goal is not to be elegant but to be blunt enough that there’s no confusion i learned the skills from reading all of caro’s lbj books”the dotcom crash hit loudcloud hard and in  it pivoted to become a software company with a new name opsware in  after years of slogging andreessen and horowitz sold the company for  billion andreessen says that the tech crash scarred him “the overwhelming message to our generation in the early nineties was ‘you’re dirty you’re all about grunge—you guys are fucking losers’ then the tech boom hit and it was ‘we are going to do amazing things’ and then the roof caved in and the wisdom was that the internet was a mirage i one hundred per cent believed that because the rejection was so personal—both what everybody thought of me and what i thought of myself i was not depressed but i was growly in retrospect” he concluded “we were five or six years too early”peter thiel who is four years older than andreessen observed that “the late nineties for gen xers in silicon valley was an experience as powerful as the late sixties was for the younger boomers the sixties was a transformative moment that got shortcircuited by nixon and for marc the nineties—when netscape was iconic and he was deeply living the belief that technology was going to inspire liberalization everywhere—was shortcircuited by the superpowerful bust and return of the old economy but marc is very tenacious”andreessen said he learned that while technology improves steadily “psychologically there’s no middle ground—the plane is always headed straight up or straight down” recognizing that he was a poor manager and needing to buffer those emotional and financial swings andreessen saw that the obvious next move was a portfolio of investments in  he and horowitz began angel investing separately and then together they put ten million dollars into fifty companies including facebook twitter and linkedin then andreessen began pushing to start a venture firm “i always thought the entire venture thing was incredibly cool” he told me “going to kleiner perkins”—the firm that funded netscape—“with the high ceilings the markers on the wall of all the great companies they’d ipo’d larry ellison walking through and at  am the biggest buffet you’ve ever seen at a time when i was eating at subway it was the closest thing to a cathedral for nerds” mark zuckerberg told me “when marc started andreessen horowitz i asked him why he didn’t start another company instead and he said ‘it would be like going back to kindergarten’ ”az was designed not merely to succeed but also to deliver payback it would right the wrongs that andreessen and horowitz had suffered as entrepreneurs most of those in their telling came from benchmark capital the firm that funded loudcloud and recently led the a rounds of uber and snapchat—a fivepartner boutique with no backoffice specialists to provide the services they’d craved “we were always the antibenchmark” horowitz told me “our design was to not do what they did” horowitz is still mad that one benchmark partner asked him in front of his cofounders “when are you going to get a real ceo” and that benchmark’s bestknown vc the sixfeeteight bill gurley another outspoken giant with a large twitter following advised horowitz to cut andreessen and his sixmilliondollar investment out of the company andreessen said “i can’t stand him if you’ve seen ‘seinfeld’ bill gurley is my newman”—jerry’s bête noireaz’s services model made a strong impression on sand hill road “andreessen caused us to up our game on the marketing side” sequoia’s doug leone told me “younger founders pay attention to media and we don’t want to be depositioned” sequoia hired an inhouse publicist and two new marketing specialists to complement the four it had and most top firms made similar moves even if they privately believed that az’s services were simply a marketing tool todd mckinnon the ceo of okta said “every firm we talk to now is ‘hey we’re doing all this recruiting and we’ll introduce you to big customers’ it’s become the table stakes”benchmark by contrast took down its web site “it’s like watching coke and pepsi go head to head” one ceo told me bill gurley declined my requests for comment but he has publicly bemoaned all the money that firms such as az are pumping into the system at a time when he and many other vcs worry that the tech sector is experiencing another bubble so many investors from outside the valley want in on the startup world that valuations have been soaring last year thirtyeight us startups received billiondollar valuations twentythree more than in  many vcs have told their companies to raise as much money as possible now to have a buffer against a crashbenchmark’s funds top out at four hundred million dollars and are reserved for earlyround investing the original artisanal venture model az raised  billion each for its third and fourth funds in  and  with much of the money earmarked for later costlier growth rounds whose returns tend to be capped at x andreessen argues that startups now wait longer and raise more capital before going public and az wants to be in those conversations too he also says that larger funds will allow the firm to provide even more of the services that its entrepreneurs crave but in the valley increasing your fund size so dramatically is customarily seen as “smoking your own exhaust” or among those with a classical turn of mind hubris “venture doesn’t scale” diane mulcahy the lp and venture critic said “raising and investing more doesn’t increase the number of billiondollar companies and offering services to entrepreneurs won’t help the firm generate returns it’s like a saks fifth avenue that gives everybody a free iphone are they going to attract everybody and see everybody yes are they going to make money not for long”when i pressed andreessen on az’s fund size he said that even if the basic assumptions haven’t changed—even if only fifteen companies a year reach a hundred million dollars in revenue—those companies generate more money now and he said “i’d bet the number of companies that reach that revenue is going up” with a playful smile he referred to gurley “if there’s no profit opportunity beyond the first four hundred million bill’s making the case that everyone who follows benchmark in a later investment round is a moron i wouldn’t say that”one morning as i sat down to breakfast with andreessen a rival vc sent me a long email about az’s holdings the vc estimated that because andreessen’s firm had taken so many growth positions its average ownership stake was roughly  per cent it’s eight per cent which meant that to get x to x across its four funds “you would need your aggregate portfolio to be worth b” you would in other words need to invest in every facebook and uber that came along when i started to check the math with andreessen he made a jerkingoff motion and said “blahblahblah we have all the models—we’re elephant hunting going after big game”in addition to assuaging various slights from vcs andreessen is attempting to assuage the wound of the  crash by maintaining that it was an isolated event “the argument in favor of concern is cyclical” he told me—busts follow booms “the counterargument is that stuff works now in  you had fifty million people on the internet and the number of smartphones was zero today you have three billion internet users and two billion smartphones it’s pong versus nintendo it’s carlota perez’s argument that technology is adopted on an s curve the installation phase the crash—because the technology isn’t ready yet—and then the deployment phase when technology gets adopted by everyone and the real money gets made” so the  tech crash prefigured not the next crash but a sustained boom and andreessen’s portfolio like the entire sand hill road enterprise wasn’t so much overpriced as underappreciated“we even tried a visit from a celebrity”still he recently tweeted that startups were spending too much when the market turns he wrote “nobody will want to buy your cashincinerating startup there will be no plan b vaporize” and come to think of it maybe it wasn’t prudent to raise too much either in one pitch meeting where a portfolio company sought a billiondollar growth round andreessen raised his arms overhead and made an explosive sound to warn of what can happen when your valuation vastly exceeds your revenues “thanks for playing—game over” the company went on to secure its round with only a token contribution from az andreessen later said that as in an increasing number of deals growth investors had paid one round ahead of progress—paid in other words for the results they hoped to see in the following round though the company’s lofty valuation buoyed az’s portfolio his body language suggested that buying at such valuations was maybe not smart—“but as long as they’re sophisticated investors it’s not our job to moralize on whether they’re overpaying”another way of framing the growthfunding question peter thiel suggests is that andreessen may not be as suited to making early counterintuitive investments as he is—a point that andreessen concedes “peter is just smarter than i am and in a lateral way” but thiel says andreessen is well positioned because of his broad knowledge and flexible mindset to respond to incremental changes in an array of fields and that he argues is what the times reward “while twitter is a lesser innovation than flying cars it’s a much more valuable business we live in a financial age not a technological age”in december apoorva mehta the founder of a grocerydelivery app called instacart came to az to ask it to fill out his c round the firm had led mehta’s b round with an investment of twentyseven million dollars but he reminded the team anyway that instacart “is quite a magical experience” then he invoked a few sharingeconomy shibboleths including “we don’t have any infrastructure” “mobilepowered independent contractors” and “machinelearningbased fulfillment engine” in two years mehta had set up in fifteen cities signed up many of the independent grocery chains including whole foods and showed profitability in a number of stores and it was a defensible network because he installed refrigerated lockers in the stores at the same time because mehta had recently changed his model instacart was losing money on each delivery and that amount was growing as he rapidly expanded into new marketsandreessen applied a disinfecting wipe and said “let me ask you a question i know the answer to in  there was no more flaming debacle of a business than grocery delivery online you were probably twelve at the time of webvan”“thirteen” mehta said“so why now”“the main reason is you have access to labor through smartphones it’s the same reason uber and lyft exist now”andreessen nodded with satisfaction “you can orchestrate the entire supply chain through your phone” webvan was what he called a “ghost story”—a cautionary tale that still frightened investors but instacart proved that even haunted houses could be rehabilitatedanother partner asked about competitors including uber taskrabbit amazon fresh and fresh direct “the other older models can’t do instant delivery” mehta replied “and the newer ones don’t have anywhere near our coverage and range of data in groceries so if you want slower delivery and smaller selection go with them” andreessen smiled savoring the contemptat the deal review jeff jordan who sits on instacart’s board praised mehta’s progress while noting concerns about unit economics—how he’d get to profitability on each delivery referring to the venture community’s enthusiasm for the round jordan went on “this is an ‘i missed uber i don’t want to miss the next one’ climate” balancing everything he recommended that the firm put in ten million dollarshorowitz argued for a bigger investment mehta’s moat against competitors “is really fucking deep—he already has whole foods monster of monsters it’s the biggest market of all time incredibly huge”after other partners argued that the valuation seemed high andreessen looked at horowitz “ben i think you’re making an even more provocative point than people understand it sounds like you’re saying this could be an uber for real”“i think so” horowitz said “what makes unit economics really scary is if you’re in a competitive market he’s in a monopoly”andreessen said “we could go to the well and go in higher” he beckoned coaxingly horowitz thought it over then said “i don’t want to override jeff” andreessen too seemed content to temper his enthusiasm and to share the round with other firms mehta eventually raised two hundred and twenty million dollars on a valuation of two billion he’d like to make twenty times the investments the firm does but every opportunity comes with an opportunity cost and even  billion doesn’t last foreverandrew golden the chief investment officer for princeton university an lp in az’s last three funds told me that when the firm started “my worry was that marc is such a big personality he wouldn’t necessarily listen to someone who told him he was wearing fewer clothes than he thought but now my working hypothesis is that marc is smart enough to know that he’ll do better if he doesn’t try to win every argument—if he doesn’t try to go undefeated”in march andreessen and his wife announced the birth of their son who’d been carried to term by a gestational surrogate they named him john for laura’s father “i feel fantastic” andreessen told me “he’ll come of age in a world where ten or a hundred times more people will be able to contribute in science and medicine and the arts a more peaceful and prosperous world” he added tongue in cheek “i’m going to teach him how to take over that world”andreessen often remarks that in the bluecollar milieu he came from no parent wants his or her child to stay bluecollar his own circumstances have changed dramatically—he is now a paper billionaire though he argues that his net worth depends on how you value az—so i told him it seemed paradoxical that some of his other babies such as instacart and lyft make their profits off bluecollar drivers and pickers who must freelance without a safety net to make ends meet unsurprisingly he strongly disagreed “maybe there’s an alternate way of living a freeform life where you press the button and get work when you want to”one afternoon as we sat at his baronial dining table he made an agonized but sincere effort to discuss his bluecollar childhood without mentioning his nuclear family “i really identified with charles schulz in the david michaelis biography of him ‘schulz and peanuts’ ” he said i was struck by the parallels between andreessen and both “peanuts”—in which charlie brown has a massive bald head and the parents are kept offstage—and its creator charles schulz who grew up in minnesota was socially awkward hated being embraced and loathed his mother’s norwegian relatives a farming family andreessen went on “ninetysix per cent of the people who grow up like he and i did in the midwest just stay there but the ones who leave”—the cartoonist too moved to california—“become intensely interested in the future in schulz’s last ten years he really focussed on rerun linus’s younger brother—the youngest and most optimistic character”i told andreessen that this seemed like a tendentious reading of rerun a bland character whose two most famous lines are “i’ll drink to that” and “my brother is the only one in the family with a blanket and i don’t want to end up like him” taken aback he explained “he’s the youngest he’s the newest he has the most life in front of him” andreessen as he saw himself was both an immigrant to the land of opportunity like the entrepreneurs he preferred to fund and someone whose childhood was merely an installation phase he told me “it wasn’t that i felt misunderstood or badly treated it was that i was so completely different i wasn’t seeking understanding i wasn’t indexing myself against the people around me”andreessen reminded me—in his formidable achievements and manner his thickly armored sensitivities and yearnings—of rilke’s remark “perhaps everything that frightens us is in its deepest essence something helpless that wants our love” when i told him so he stared back in absolute horrorlast year a programmer named alex payne wrote an open letter to andreessen in which he observed “people are scared of so much wealth and control being in so few hands consequently wherever you and other gatekeepers of capital direct your attention—towards robots d printers biotech whatever—you’re going to detect a fearful response as people scramble to determine the impact of your decisions and whims” which only compound “lingering structural unemployment and an accumulation of capital at the top of the economic pyramid”“good evening ladies and gentlemen if i may have just a moment of your time—my name is edward and i’ll be sitting here reading the paper with my mouth shut thank you for you time have a good evening and god bless”payne addressed his thoughts to andreessen because andreessen represents the valley—both in its soaring vision and in its tendency to treat people as a fungible mass but andreessen waved away the criticisms as the ravings of “a selfhating software engineer” when i persisted he said “ordinary people love the iphone facebook google search airbnb and lyft it’s only the intellectuals who worry” he raised counterarguments then dismissed them technology would solve any environmental crisis hastened by an expanding economy and as for the notion that as he said “ ‘you american imperialist asshole not everyone wants all that technology’—well bullshit go to a chinese village and ask them” technology gives us superpowers makes us smarter more powerful happier “would the world be a better place if there were fifty silicon valleys” he said “obviously yes over the past thirty years the level of income throughout the developing world is rising the number of people in poverty is shrinking health outcomes are improving birth rates are falling and it’ll be even better in ten years pessimism always sounds more sophisticated than optimism—it’s the edencollapse myth over and over again—and then you look at gdp per capita worldwide and it’s up and to the right if this is collapse let’s have more of it”global unemployment is rising too—this seems to be the first industrial revolution that wipes out more jobs than it creates one  paper argues that fortyseven per cent of all american jobs are destined to be automated andreessen argues that his firm’s entire portfolio is creating jobs and that such companies as udacity which offers lowcost online “nanodegrees” in programming and honor which aims to provide better and betterpaid inhome care for the elderly bring us closer to a future in which everyone will either be doing more interesting work or be kicking back and painting sunsets but when i brought up the raft of data suggesting that intracountry inequality is in fact increasing even as it decreases when averaged across the globe—america’s wealth gap is the widest it’s been since the government began measuring it—andreessen rerouted the conversation saying that such gaps were “a skills problem” and that as robots ate the old boring jobs humanity should simply retool “my response to larry summers when he says that people are like horses they have only their manual labor to offer”—he threw up his hands “that is such a dark and dim and dystopian view of humanity i can hardly stand it”one challenge for andreessen is whether venture itself has a skills problem if software is truly eating the world wouldn’t venture capital be on the menu the angellist platform now allows investors to fund startups online its cofounder naval ravikant said that “future companies will require more twohundredthousanddollar checks and way fewer guys on sand hill road” jeff fagnan of atlas venture which is the largest investor in angellist said “software is already squeezing out other intermediaries—travel agents financial advisers—and at the end of the day vcs are intermediaries we’re all just selling cash”andreessen sometimes wonders if ravikant is onto something he’s asked horowitz “what if we’re the most evolved dinosaur and naval is a bird” already more than half the tech companies that reached a billiondollar valuation in the past decade were based outside silicon valley and as andreessen himself wrote in  before he became a vc “odds are nothing your vc does no matter how helpful or wellintentioned is going to tip the balance between success and failure”he still believes that—but he also thinks that az can cut a company’s time to success in half and time is money he also believes that venture will maintain its incumbency because computers can’t yet introduce you to just the right engineer or chief information officer at ebay and machines can’t yet come to your office at midnight to futureproof your letter to perturbed customers indeed venture is one of the most human businesses going only human beings could have created such a supercollider of contradictions a font of innovation that pools around conformity a freedom train that speeds toward monopoly a promoter of transparency that shrouds its own dealings a guild that’s dedicated to flattening hierarchies and that rewards its leaders with imperial powernaturally andreessen had to weigh the counterargument and consider whether he added any value at all one sunday afternoon as he sat alone at the head of az’s conference table he said “chris dixon argues that we’re in the magicalproducts business—that we fool ourselves into thinking we’re building companies but it doesn’t matter if we don’t have the magical products” and magic could not be summoned only prepared for “over twenty years” he continued “our returns are going to come down to two or three or four investments and the rest of this”—his gesture took in the building full of art the devotions of more than a hundred eager souls even the fauxmoorish rooftops of his competitors down the road—“is the cost of getting the chance at those investments there’s a sense in which all of this is math—you just don’t know which tuesday mark zuckerberg is going to walk in”yet math was no help with mass psychology “even if we could do perfect analysis we just can’t know the future” he said “what if google ventures had access to all google searches—could you predict hit products or perfect access to all of people’s conversations or purchases you still wouldn’t know what’s going to happen how is psychohistory going” he went on referring to isaac asimov’s invention in his “foundation” novels of a statistical field that could predict the behavior of civilizations “not very fucking good at all which by the way is part of what makes this job really fun it’s a people business if we could revise the industry completely we’d just dump all the business plans and focus on people—the twentythreeyearold mark zuckerberg bill gates steve jobs”he acknowledged though that his optimism dims once human beings—with their illogic hidden agendas and sheer bugginess—enter the equation “we’re imperfect people pursuing perfect ideas and there’s tremendous frustration in the gap” he said “writing code one or two people that’s the platonic ideal but when you want to impact the world you need one hundred people then one thousand then ten thousand—and people have all these people issues” he examined the problem in silence “a world of just computers wouldn’t work” he concluded wistfully “but a world of just people could certainly be improved” ♦an earlier version of this article misstated the name of sequoia capitalmost popularnews deskwhat the layoffs look like at the carrier plant trump said he’d

thirty years”photograph by joe puglieseon a bright october morning suhail doshi drove to silicon valley in his parents’ honda civic carrying a laptop with a twelveslide presentation that was surely worth at least fifty million dollars doshi the twentysixyearold ceo of a dataanalytics startup called mixpanel had come from san francisco to sand hill road in menlo park where many of the world’s most prestigious venturecapital firms cluster to pitch andreessen horowitz the road’s newest and most unusual firm inside the offices he stood at the head of a massive beechwood conference table to address the firm’s deal team and its seven general partners—the men who venture the money take a seat on the board and fire the entrepreneur if things go wrongmarc andreessen the firm’s cofounder fixed his gaze on doshi as he disinfected his germless hands with a sanitizing wipe andreessen is fortythree years old and six feet five inches tall with a cranium so large bald and oblong that you can’t help but think of words like “jumbo” and “grade a” two decades ago he was the animating spirit of netscape the web browser that launched the internet boom in many respects he is the quintessential silicon valley venture capitalist an imposing fortyish longcelebrated white man forbes’s midas list of the top hundred vcs includes just five women but whereas most vcs maintain a casualfriday vibe andreessen seethes with beliefs he’s an evangelist for the church of technology afire to reorder life as we know it he believes that tech products will soon erase such primitive behaviors as paying cash bitcoin eating cooked food soylent and enduring a world unimproved by virtual reality oculus vr he believes that silicon valley is mission control for mankind which is therefore on a steep trajectory toward perfection and when he so argues firehosing you with syllogisms and data points and prerefuting every potential rebuttal he’s very persuasivedoshi lean and quizzical in a maroon tshirt and jeans began his pitch by declaring “most of the world will make decisions by either guessing or using their gut they will be either lucky or wrong” far better to apply mixpanel’s analytics which enable mobilebased companies to know exactly who their customers are and how they use their apps doshi rapidly escalated to rhetoric—“we want to do data science for every single market in the world”—that would sound bumptious anywhere but on sand hill road where the young guy in jeans is obligated to astound the middleaged guys in cashmere vnecks “mediocre vcs want to see that your company has traction” doshi told me “the top vcs want you to show them you can invent the future”if you have a crackerjack idea one of your stops on sand hill road will be andreessen horowitz often referred to by its alphanumeric url az there are sixteen letters between the “a” in andreessen and the “z” in horowitz since the firm was launched six years ago it has vaulted into the top echelon of venture concerns competing vcs disturbed by its speed and its power and the lavish prices it paid for deals gave it another nickname aho each year three thousand startups approach az with a “warm intro” from someone the firm knows az invests in fifteen of those at least ten will fold three or four will prosper and one might soar to be worth more than a billion dollars—a “unicorn” in the local parlance with great luck once a decade that unicorn will become a google or a facebook and return the vc’s money a thousand times over the storied x there are eight hundred and three vc firms in the us and last year they spent fortyeight billion dollars chasing that dreamdoshi had run the gantlet before in  he tracked down andreessen and his equally if less splendidly bald cofounder ben horowitz at a ritzcarlton near tucson then he pitched them in the lobby having made sure that his parents’ honda which contained his father was well out of sight doshi mentioned that he’d become so dissatisfied with the incumbent database software that he’d built his own andreessen later told me that this “was like a cub reporter saying ‘i need to write the great american novel before i can really file this story’ ” az gave doshi ten million dollars and he gave it twentyfive per cent of his companynow he was back for more he zipped through his slides hundredpercent growth rate head count doubling every six to nine months and he still had all the money he’d raised last time as andreessen drank an iced tea in two gulps and began to roam the room doshi called up a slide that showed his competitors—localytics amplitude google analytics—grouped into quadrants then he explained how he’d crush each quadrant “i want to buy a machinelearning team i want to buy cuttingedge server hardware” he said indicating his allbutobliterated competitors he added “i want to buy stuff no one here can afford” he jammed his hands in his pockets questionswhile entrepreneurs attack with historiography—“the greatman view of history is correct and i am that great man”—vcs defend with doubletalk “you’re definitely going to get funded” means “but not by us” “who else is in” means “besides not us” and “i’m not sure i would ever use your product myself” means “so long” but the best vcs test the entrepreneur’s mettle as well as their own assumptions andreessen gripped the back of his chair “so one way to describe what you’re doing is a network effect” he said “more data gives you more customers which allows you to build more services which gives you more data which allows you to get more customers and you just turn the crank” doshi thought this over and said “sure” andreessen grinned he’s a systems thinker and he’d grasped how mixpanel fit into the system after the pitch he told me that mixpanel is “a picksandshovels business right in the middle of the gold rush”when a startup is just an idea and a few employees it looks for seedround funding when it has a product that early adopters like—or when it’s run through its seedround money—it tries to raise an a round once the product catches on it’s time for a b round and on the rounds go most vcs contemplating an investment in one of these early rounds consider the same factors “the bottom seventy per cent of vcs just go down a checklist” jordan cooper a new york entrepreneur and vc said “monthly recurring revenue founder with experience good sales pipeline x per cent of monthovermonth growth” vcs also patternmatch if the kids are into snapchat fund things like it yik yak streetchat oovoo or at a slightly deeper level if two dropouts from stanford’s computerscience phd program created google fund more stanford csp dropouts because they blend superior capacity with monetizable dissatisfactionventure capitalists with a knack for the x know that true innovations don’t follow a pattern the future is always stranger than we expect mobile phones and the internet not flying cars doug leone one of the leaders of sequoia capital by consensus silicon valley’s top firm said “the biggest outcomes come when you break your previous mental model the blackswan events of the past forty years—the pc the router the internet the iphone—nobody had theses around those so what’s useful to us is having dumbo ears” a great vc keeps his ears pricked for a disturbing story with the elements of a fairy tale this tale begins in another age which happens to be the future and features a lowborn hero who knows a secret from his hardscrabble experience the hero encounters royalty the vcs who test him and he harnesses magic technology to prevail the tale ends in heaping treasure chests for all borne home on the unicorn’s backat pitch meetings andreessen is relatively measured he reserves his passion for the deal review afterward when the firm decides whether to invest that’s where he asks questions that oblige his partners to envision a new world for the ridesharing service lyft “don’t think about how big the taxi market is what if people no longer owned cars” for offerup “what if all this selling online—ebay and craigslist—goes to mobile how big could it be” ben horowitz who sits next to his cofounder at the head of the table is an astute manager who quotes the rap lyrics of his friends nas and kanye west to inspire fearless thinking—but he doesn’t try to manage andreessen “if you say to marc ‘don’t bite somebody’s fucking head off’ that would be wrong” horowitz said “because a lot of his value when you’re making giant decisions for huge amounts of money is saying ‘why aren’t you fucking considering this and this and this’ ”“in new york we wouldn’t call this quick”az was designed to be a fullthroated argument about the future a design predicated on its founders’ comfort with conflict in  when horowitz was a netscape product manager he wrote a note to andreessen accusing him of prematurely revealing the company’s new strategy to a reporter andreessen wrote back to say that it would be horowitz’s fault if the company failed “next time do the fucking interview yourself fuck you” ordinarily relationship over “when he feels disrespected marc can cut you out of his life like a cancer” one of andreessen’s close friends said “but ben and marc fight like cats and dogs then forget about it” two years later when netscape was floundering and forty per cent of its employees left horowitz announced that he was staying no matter what andreessen had never trusted anyone before but he began to consider it their teamwork at az is complementary horowitz is the peopleperson ceo and andreessen is the farsighted theorist the chairman yet horowitz noted that “marc is much more sensitive than i am actually he’ll get upset about my body language—‘god damn it ben you look like you’re going to throw up when i’m talking about this’ ”although andreessen has been a board member of facebook hewlettpackard and ebay he doesn’t take many board seats in az’s portfolio companies preferring to train his eyes on the horizon andreessen is tomorrow’s advance man routinely laying out “what will happen in the next ten twenty thirty years” as if he were glancing at his google calendar he views his acuity as a matter of careful observation and extrapolation and often invokes william gibson’s observation “the future is already here—it’s just not very evenly distributed” jet packs have been around for half a century but you still can’t buy them at target to smooth out such lumps in distribution andreessen disseminates his views via every available podcast and panel discussion and cnn interview slot he’s a media soothsayer andreessen the magnificent he also tweets a hundred and ten times a day inundating his three hundred and ten thousand followers with aphorisms and statistics and tweetstorm jeremiads andreessen says that he loves twitter because “reporters are obsessed with it it’s like a tube and i have loudspeakers installed in every reporting cubicle around the world” he believes that if you say it often enough and insistently enough it will come—a glorious revenge he told me “we have this theory of nerd nation of forty or fifty million people all over the world who believe that other nerds have more in common with them than the people in their own country so you get to choose what tribe or band or group you’re a part of” the nationstates of twitter will map the worldmixpanel was emblematic of silicon valley’s outsized worship of unicorns at the company’s deal review peter levine who sits on doshi’s board reported that the entrepreneur had emailed to say that he’d love for his company to be valued at a billion dollars—an assessment that would set the price for the portion of it that az might now buy however doshi would sell the firm ten per cent of his company for eighty million suggesting a valuation of eight hundred million dollars andreessen said “the dogs are fucking jumping through the screen door to eat the dog food and he hasn’t done any marketing yet and he’s profitable”horowitz exclaimed “how old is he twentyfour god damn it let’s give him all our money” az provided doshi all his bround funding—sixtyfive million dollars—for a further  per cent of the company which was thus valued at eight hundred and sixtyfive million dollars doshi was a little sorry that mixpanel wasn’t valued at a billion dollars but he told me that he could wait his business was growing so fast and everyone was raising money so frequently in the current boom that “in six or twelve months we’ll be a unicorn”venture firms rarely do an entire followon round themselves for fear of losing sight of a company’s true market value as andreessen put it “you can be thinking your shit smells like ice cream” none of the halfdozen other firms that doshi pitched last fall valued his company as highly as az did but andreessen applied a maxim from his friend and intellectual sparring partner peter thiel who cofounded paypal and was an early investor in linkedin and yelp when a reputable venture firm leads two consecutive rounds of investment in a company andreessen told me thiel believes that that is “a screaming buy signal and the bigger the markup on the last round the more undervalued the company is” thiel’s point which takes a moment to digest is that when a company grows extremely rapidly even its bullish vcs having recently set a relatively low value on the previous round will be slightly stuck in the past the faster the growth the farther behind they’ll be andreessen grinned appreciating the paradox the more they paid for mixpanel—according to thiel anyway—the better a deal they’d be gettingmost businesses don’t work like this at least not yetsilicon valley the fifteenhundred squaremile shelf an hour south of san francisco was called the santa clara valley until the rise of the microprocessor in the nineteenseventies it remains contested ground armies of startups attack every incumbent with early employees—and sometimes even their lawyers and landlords—taking deferred compensation in the hope that their options and warrants will pay off down the line yet workers’ loyalty is not to a company or even to an idea but to the iterative promise of the region “uber is built on the efforts of thousands of people in the valley” the investor naval ravikant said “on the

also anoint you the imprimatur of a top firm’s investment is so powerful that entrepreneurs routinely accept a twentyfive per cent lower valuation to get it patrick collison a cofounder of the onlinepayment company stripe says that landing sequoia peter thiel and az as seed investors “was a signal that was not lost on the banks we wanted to work with” laughing he noted that the valuation in the next round of funding—“for a prelaunch company from very untested entrepreneurs who had very few customers”—was a hundred million dollars stewart butterfield a cofounder of the officemessaging app slack told me “it’s hard to overestimate how much the perception of the quality of the vc firm you’re with matters—the signal it sends to other vcs to potential employees to customers to the tech press it’s like where you went to college”a venture firm musters its ammunition—say a fund of a hundred and fifty million dollars—by recruiting investors such as university endowments and pension funds to become “limited partners” or lps in the fund the firm invests the money for three or four years then harvests the returns for the remainder of the fund’s tenyear term in theory vcs like entrepreneurs are motivated by delayed gratification the standard fee is “two and twenty” two per cent of the fund each year and twenty per cent of the ultimate profits the top firms including az charge thirty per cent lps expect returns equal to at least those they’d get in the stock market plus an additional five per cent for the illiquidity of the investment for top firms the dream is x to

company said “but the bang for the buck is huge and venture is a major source of the optimism that underlies the american myth” venture speeds the cycle of american impatience what exists is bad and what replaces it is good—until the new thing itself must be supplantedcorporate culture civic responsibility becoming a pillar of society—these are not venture’s concerns andy weissman a partner at new york’s union square ventures noted that venture in the valley is a perfect embodiment of the capitalist dynamic that the economist joseph schumpeter called “creative destruction” weissman said “silicon valley vcs are all technooptimists they have the arrogant belief that you can take a geography and remove all obstructions and have nothing but a free flow of capital and ideas and that it’s good it’s very good to creatively destroy everything that has gone before” some silicon valley vcs believe that these values would have greater sway if their community left america behind andreessen’s nerd nation with a charter and a geographic locale peter thiel favors “seasteading” establishing floating cities in the middle of the ocean balaji srinivasan until recently a general partner at az and now the chairman of one of its bitcoin companies has called for the “ultimate exit” arguing that the united states is as fossilized as microsoft and that the valley has become stronger than boston new york los angeles and washington dc combined srinivasan believes that its denizens should “build an optin society ultimately outside the us run by technology”the game in silicon valley while it remains part of california is not ferocious intelligence or a contrarian investment thesis everyone has that it’s not even wealth anyone can become a billionaire just by rooming with mark zuckerberg it’s prescience and then it’s removing every obstacle to the ferocious clarity of your vision incumbents regulations folkways people can you not just see the future but summon itmarc andreessen mentions thomas edison often his family never when he was growing up outside the nostoplight town of new lisbon wisconsin his father lowell was a sales manager for a seed company called pioneer hibred international and his mother pat worked in customer service at lands’ end—but i didn’t get that information from him a friend who knows andreessen well told me “we’ve never had a conversation about his parents or his brother—all he said was ‘they didn’t like me and i didn’t like them all that much either’ ”the few details andreessen let slip to me suggested a climate of antiquity superstition frustration and penury “the natural state of human beings is to be subsistence farmers and that was my expectation” he said adding that his world was “scandinavian hardcore very selfdenying people who go through life never expecting to be happy” the family telephone was a party line and the bathroom at his relatives’ farm was an outhouse everyone believed in dowsing and the weather reports in the farmers’ almanac one winter with money tight his father decided to stop paying for gas heat “and we spent a great deal of time chopping fucking wood” the local movie theatre one town over was an unheated room that doubled as a fertilizerstorage depot andreessen wore a puffy pioneer hibred coat to watch “star wars” while sitting on the makings of a huge bomb he had to drive an hour to find a waldenbooks in la crosse it was all cookbooks and cat calendars so he later saw amazon as a heroic disseminator of knowledge and progress “screw the independent bookstores” he told me “there weren’t any near where i grew up there were only ones in college towns the rest of us could go pound sand”andreessen’s vision of the future and of his escape route came from television he told me “kitt the car in ‘knight rider’ was a computer that could analyze a poisongas attack the car was magic—but now you can actually do all those things a new car isn’t kitt but it does have all the maps and all the music in the world and it talks to you even the transporter beam in ‘star trek’ basically makes sense if you understand quantum entanglement people are composed of quantum elements so there is a path”something of the transporter beam clings to andreessen a sense that he just rematerialized from a city on the edge of forever he’s not great at the basics of daily life directions confound him because roadways aren’t logical and he’s so absentminded about sunglasses that he keeps a “reload station” with nine pairs on his hall table perhaps edison haunts his conversation because andreessen is a fellowtinkerer except that his gadgets are systems and platforms and his workshop is his own mind he regularly reprograms his appearance and deportment—his user interface—to suit his present role and friends refer to chapters in his life as versions of an operating system “marc ” “marc ” and so on a charismatic introvert andreessen draws people in but doesn’t really want them around though he has a crisp sense of humor it’s rarely deployed at his own expense he hates being complimented looked at or embraced and has toyed with the idea of wearing a tshirt that says “no hugging no touching” he doesn’t grasp the protocols of social chitchat and prefers getting a memo to which he can email a response typing at a hundred and forty words a minute he didn’t attend netscape’s twentiethanniversary celebration because it combined two things from which he recoils parties and reminiscingyet he’s also energetic and decisive which makes him a valued counsellor in  yahoo offered to buy facebook for a billion dollars and accel partners facebook’s lead investor urged mark zuckerberg to accept andreessen said “every single person involved in facebook wanted mark to take the yahoo offer the psychological pressure they put on this twentytwoyearold was intense mark and i really bonded in that period because i told him ‘don’t sell don’t sell don’t sell’ ” zuckerberg told me “marc has this really deep belief that when companies are executing well on their vision they can have a much bigger effect on the world than people think not just as a business but as a steward of humanity—if they have the time to execute” he didn’t sell facebook is now worth two hundred and eighteen billion dollarsandreessen’s range of reference extends from ibn khaldun to “south park” yet he approaches new topics as if starved eating through men’s fashion or whiskeymaking or congressional politics until it has yielded every micronutrient in a tweetstorm about the question of net neutrality he observed that anyone who took a position should be versed in the “history technology and economics of backbones interconnection agreement peering cdns caching colocation current and future telco and cable business models including capex and opex models rate caps cost of capital return on investment” as well as a dozen other equally abstruse matters he coyly noted that no one himself included understood them all—then stated his position andreessen’s learning fuses the idiosyncrasy of the autodidact with the thoroughness of what programmers call depthfirst search “i could never tolerate not knowing why” he said “you have to work your way back to figure out the politics the motivations i always stop when i get to evolutionary psychology and why we have tribes—oh ok we’re primates cursed with emotions and the ability to do logical thinking” he keeps rediscovering that we’re australopithecines and keeps hoping to transform us into homo habilis man the tool user able manto this end he addresses any topic such as google’s purchase of the thermostat maker nest by launching a dialectics—“ either nest is the most amazing company ever or  larry page acquihired tony fadell for  billion and got a thermostat business on the side”—whose synthesis is often that the thesis and the antithesis were simplistic “or maybe google has a larger plan for automating the home” or irrelevant “whatever whatever we don’t own it so who cares” often he discourses at such lucid length that his cheeks redden and he must pause for breath if you seize the interval to demonstrate a basic grasp of his argument he’ll say “exzactly” with a pleased smile and upload another tranche what saves him from pompous knowitalldom most of the time is this eagerness to communicatehe turns to theory the way a drinker turns to the minibar but horowitz told me that every once in a while andreessen will “get all wisconsin on you sticking up for his people when we looked at an internet pawnshop people here said ‘it’s immoral’ and marc went bananas he said ‘if you’ve got no fucking money and you need to pawn your watch to pay for your kids to eat—you think that’s morally fucking wrong because it offends your sensibilities you rich motherfuckers’ he knew that guy who was pawning his watch because he’d missed the harvest or whatever or we saw an uberforprivatejets thing or some wine thing that came through and he just got incensed ‘we didn’t start the firm for rich people to buy hundreddollar bottles of wine or to fly around on fucking private jets’ he reminds me of kanye that level of emotional intensity—his childhood was so intensely bad he just won’t go there”one afternoon alexis ringwald the ceo of learnup a jobtraining startup that has worked with staples and old navy stood in az’s conference room all poise and smile “i like to launch movements to tackle huge problems” she said launching into her presentation“start at the beginning where you grew up” ben horowitz said az had made a small seed investment in ringwald’s company but most of the general partners who were about to tell her whether she was ready for an a round didn’t know much about her horowitz also routinely forces a founder to abandon her script and regroup it’s a stress test intended to elicit biography resilience and the real story“how many times do i have to tell you to stay inside the bowl”ringwald who is thirtyone blinked then shifted smoothly to an engaging account of her early years her work interviewing people on the unemployment line and how she’d eventually realized that the country’s biggest gulf is between those who have the basic skills to be employable—showing up on time dressing neatly—and those who don’t “so it’s a modern ‘my fair lady’ sort of thing” horowitz asked ingenuously ringwald crisply noted that her process triples an applicant’s chance of getting a job and that eightytwo per cent of learnup’s trainees outperform their fellowworkers horowitz and andreessen nodded she could handle the pressure afterward horowitz told me “my big conclusion was she’s a legit pied piper with charisma and will and fury”pitch meetings are minefields if a vc asks you “when you get to a hundred engineers are you worried about the company culture or excited” the correct answer is “a hundred i want a thousand” reid hoffman a vc at greylock partners who cofounded linkedin told me “i look to see if someone has a marine strategy for taking the beach an army strategy for taking the country and a police strategy for governing the country afterward”az wants to learn if the founder has a secret—a novel insight drawn from personal experience about how the world could be better arranged if that new arrangement is x better consumers might be won over balaji srinivasan contributed the concept of the “idea maze” you want the entrepreneur to have spent years thinking her idea into—and out of—every conceivable dead end “entrepreneurs want to raise money from us” andreessen told me “so the natural thing when we say ‘what if you did this’ is to tell us what we want to hear but we don’t want to hear what we want to hear it’s a delight when they look at you with contempt—you idiot—and then walk you through the idea maze and explain why your idea won’t work” such tests help az determine whether the founder is a mercenary who wants to sell the company within four years which will cap az’s return at x or a missionary determined to change the world “at the same time” andreessen said “we’re not funding mother teresa we’re funding imperial willtopower people who want to crush their competition companies can only have a big impact on the world if they get big”ringwald back into her planned remarks promised bigness “learnup will transform employment in america we can unleash human potential and move the needle on the gdp” andreessen said “question this is a known problem why do companies not just do this themselves once they see that it works” ringwald replied “we’ll keep on differentiating by moving fast and collecting more data on what companies need now”then a general partner named chris dixon asked “is it a marketplace or an enterprise company” marketplace companies sell to consumers enterprise companies sell to other businesses clearly perplexed by the distinction ringwald said that she was signing up workers as well as companies everyone became a shade more remoteafterward andreessen told his colleagues “she didn’t really answer chris’s question if it’s marketplace it’s defensible if it’s enterprise she can be undercut” if ringwald’s customers were the workers who would keep using learnup as they moved from job to job she could create a network effect if her customers were actually the companies they could start doing the training themselves—or another startup could az views marketplace and enterprise companies very differently the firm invests early with enterprise but waits with consumer companies because they tend to take off—suddenly everyone wants to be on instagram—or fail fast it’s a riskaverse way to embrace risk in  az passed on the a round of oculus vr waiting to see if it could resolve the nausea issue that has plagued virtualreality systems and came in on the b six months later it got the same ten per cent of the company it could have had in the a—but it paid thirty million dollars instead of six million the internal rationale for this expensive “derisking” is “we paid up for certainty”the partners began to discuss how learnup might be valued valuation particularly in a company’s early rounds often derives less from spreadsheets than from market forces—what are other firms offering—and the “what if”s of mental modelling does the company’s traction leadership team and “total addressable market” call to mind a pinterest or does it feel more like a shoedazzle one partner suggested that learnup was a “ten on thirty”—ten million dollars should buy a third of the company which would then be valued at forty million “it’s more like ten on fifteen or twenty” horowitz said cutting the company’s value in half “or six on twelve” andreessen said whittling it further soon after the meeting ringwald turned learnup into an enterprise companymost venture firms operate as a guild each partner works with his own companies and a small shared staff helps with business development and recruiting az introduced a new model the venture company its general partners make about three hundred thousand dollars a year far less than the industry standard of at least a million dollars and the savings pays for sixtyfive specialists in executive talent tech talent market development corporate development and marketing az maintains a network of twenty thousand contacts and brings two thousand established companies a year to its executive briefing center to meet its startups which has produced a pipeline of deals worth three billion dollars andreessen told me “we give our founders the networking superpower hyperaccelerating someone into a fully functional ceo in five years”the firm’s fourteenperson deal team also enables it to rapidly assess any new technology making az a kind of iron man suit for andreessen as he pursues his flights of fancy jim breyer who led facebook’s first venture round at accel partners told me “i spend most of my time trying to connect the dots for what the future will look like in five to seven years but i don’t believe i scale as well as marc and ben and their team they’ve moved into nextgen agricultural products and wearables and drone software where a lot of us don’t have expertise or networks”andreessen and horowitz launched the firm in  when venture investment was frozen by the recession their strategy was shaped by their friend andy rachleff a former vc he told them that he’d run the numbers and that fifteen technology companies a year reach a hundred million dollars in annual revenue—and they account for ninetyeight per cent of the market capitalization of companies that go public so az had to get those fifteen companies to pitch them “deal flow is everything ” andreessen told me “if you’re in a secondtier firm you never get a chance at that great company” a leading investment banker who has taken numerous software companies public told me “i put ninety per cent of my effort into seeking out deals from the top eight venture firms ten per cent into the next twelve and zero per cent into all the rest”the dirty secret of the trade is that the bottom threequarters of venture firms didn’t beat the nasdaq for the past five years in a stinging  report the lp diane mulcahy calculated “since  less cash has been returned to vc investors than they have invested” the truth is that most vcs subsist entirely on fees which they compound by raising a new fund every three years returns are kept hidden by nondisclosure agreements and so vcs routinely overstate them both to encourage investment and to attract entrepreneurs “you can’t find a venture fund anywhere that’s not in the top quartile” one lp said sardonically vcs also logo shop buying into late rounds of hot companies at high prices so they can list them on their portfolio pagewhen az began it didn’t have even an ersatz track record to promote so andreessen and horowitz consulted on tactics with their friend michael ovitz who cofounded the hollywood talent agency creative artists agency in  ovitz told me that he’d advised them to distinguish themselves by treating the entrepreneur as a client “take the long view of your platform rather than a transactional one call everyone a partner offer services the others don’t and help people who aren’t your clients disrupt to differentiate by becoming a dreamexecution machine”believing that founders make the best ceos—look at intel apple oracle google facebook—andreessen and horowitz recruited only general partners who’d been founders or run companies then they began constructing the illusion of authority taking offices on sand hill road and filling them with paintings by robert rauschenberg and sol lewitt—another page from the book of ovitz who commissioned a roy lichtenstein painting for caa’s lobby that was so large the firm had to leave it behind when it moved they were studiously punctual partners are fined ten dollars for each minute they’re late to a pitch used glassware rather than plastic and said no quickly and explained why unless the reason was doubts about the entrepreneur in a handwritten note and while most vcs were publicity averse—sequoia’s slogan was “the entrepreneurs behind the entrepreneurs”—az banged the drum to draw startups the tech publicist margit wennmachers built an eightperson marketing department and helped to orchestrate stories in forbes and fortune“they all lead back to this ball of yarn”andreessen and horowitz believed that it would take them years to get great deal flow so instead of fighting for around financings—the most competitive round because it’s when you can buy the largest chunk of an upandcoming company—they planned to make seed investments in eighty startups they wouldn’t take the customary board seats otherwise they’d each be sitting on forty boards but they’d help all eighty companies and then lead the a round for the twelve bestthe strategy had flaws entrepreneurs want vcs on their boards and so do lps that’s how you really learn a company the firm would be sending a huge negative signal about companies it didn’t reinvest in—hardly an entrepreneurfriendly stance furthermore by making so many investments az would create significant opportunity costs in its first year it put two hundred and fifty thousand dollars into a company called burbn which soon pivoted and became instagram—but az couldn’t increase its share because it had also taken a position in a shortlived photo app called picplz though the firm made x when facebook bought instagram the huge multiple amounted to only seventyeight million dollars elizabeth obershaw a managing director at horsley bridge a prominent lp that invested in az after some debate told me “our list of cons was that we didn’t think their original model would work at all the pros were marc and ben—we decided they were learners and adapters and would realize the model wasn’t workable fast enough to fix it—and an industry that was ripe for reinvention”they learned fast after az raised a threehundredmilliondollar fund and opened shop in july  it did a lot of seed rounds but it also spent fifty million dollars to buy three per cent of skype two years later microsoft bought skype and the investment returned x andreessen believed that everyone had underestimated the size of the internet market so in  after raising a much bigger second fund the firm spent a hundred and thirty million dollars to acquire shares of facebook and twitter at unprecedented valuations other vcs sniped that az was trying to buy its way in skype was an established company not a startup and the facebook and twitter deals were mere logo shopping but as ron conway silicon valley’s leading angel investor noted “in twentyfour months andreessen horowitz was the talk of the town” the firm won a hundredmilliondollar a round for the coding company github which conway called “the most hotly contested deal in five years” chris wanstrath github’s cofounder and ceo said that az’s services were a major attraction “it’s like a buffet—they offered a bunch of great dishes and we wanted to sample them all”after six years andreessen believes az is meeting—and winning—enough new clients to place it “comfortably in the top three” vc firms this is not far off from the consensus in the valley its first fund has already returned x and contains such powerhouses as slack and the identitymanagement company okta the fund’s internal rate of return a calculation of annualized profit is fifty per cent which places it very high among funds raised in  sequoia’s rate for its corresponding fund is sixtynine per cent the firm’s second fund includes pinterest and airbnb and its third fund includes zenefits github and mixpanel both funds on paper are well into the black a respected lp of the firm told me “they’re one of our top performers” yet andreessen cautioned “we still have a lot to prove on returns i wouldn’t be comfortable saying we’re no  until ten years have passed maybe fifteen until then it’s schrödinger’s cat and i’ve got really good arguments on why the cats are both alive and dead”at andreessen’s wedding in  ben horowitz said in his toast that the man he’d long known was “grouchy marc” because he’d “gone through his whole life without anyone understanding him being all by himself” no one had understood him in his farm town no one had understood him in silicon valley—“hell i do not understand him” but now at last he was “happy marc” because he’d found “someone who totally gets him” the bride a lecturer in philanthropy at stanford’s business school named laura arrillagaandreessenin december andreessen invited me to their house in atherton five minutes from az’s office to watch television he and laura live in a modern artfilled ninethousandsquarefoot villa built in a style that she calls “northern california pastiche” the ceilings are scaled to andreessen’s brobdingnagian proportions and everything is majestic minimal and new the toilet in the powder room is so visionary and the surrounding dimmer lights so flattering that i had to study it for some time to figure out how it flushedarrillagaandreessen brought the couple’s dinners into the living room and placed them on matching costco tv tables the omelettes and thai salads that their chef had prepared earlier had been freshly reheated they have three microwaves so their food will always be ready at the same time andreessen stroked her arm and beamed “hello gorgeous”“hello my darling” she replied then she gave me a dramatic hug as we hadn’t seen each other since the previous day arrillagaandreessen is a tall etherealseeming yet effusive woman when the couple met in  at a new year’s eve dinner thrown by the leading investor in eharmony they talked for six and a half hours she told me that andreessen satisfied most of the criteria on her checklist he was a genius he was a coder he was funny and he was bald “i find it incredibly sexy to see the encasement of a cerebrum” she explained for his part andreessen felt that “she was spectacular my biggest concern was that she wanted to live a jetset life” in one of the seventeen emails he sent her the next day he asked “what’s your ideal evening” she responded “stay home do email make an omelette watch tv take a bath go to bed” before their second date he delivered what she calls “a twentyfiveminute monologue on why we should go steady with a full intellectual decision tree in anticipation of my own decision tree” they were married nine months later in her and her father john a billionaire silicon valley developer andreessen seems to have found a replacement family laura showed me a photograph of the two men side by side both bald selfmade and magisterial “quite two peas in a pod”after some tv time together the couple reads in bed so that she says “i can fall asleep holding my beloved” she invariably refers to her husband as “my beloved” rather than “marc” “i ask him questions about things i got curious about during the day so every night i’m going to sleep with a human wikipedia that can go deeper and deeper and deeper link upon link in the past week we talked about all the hardware components of a mobile phone how binary code works what might happen with drone regulation and whether putin is using ukraine as a distraction from the financial crisis in russia” once she’s dozed off andreessen returns to work in his home office where like a recharging cell phone he gains energy through the nighthe pushed a button to unroll the wall screen then called up apple tv we were going to watch the final two episodes of the first season of the amc drama “halt and catch fire” about a fictional company called cardiff which enters the personalcomputer wars of the early eighties the show’s resonance for andreessen was plain in  he said “i was twelve and i didn’t know anything about startups or venture capital but i knew all the products” he used the school library’s radio shack trs to build a calculator for math homework in  as an undergraduate at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign he neglected his job—writing unix code for  an hour—to team with another programmer to create mosaic the first graphical browser for the web after graduating he moved to silicon valley where he and a volatile serial entrepreneur named jim clark launched netscape to make the internet available not just to scientists but to everyone john doerr the vc who funded their a round said that the genius of their browser was that “it was like putting photos on the menu at howard johnson you didn’t need to know the language you could just point” the story underlying that story arrillagaandreessen told me—the secret—was that “netscape was based on my beloved’s own inability as a child to access knowledge in a small town”netscape navigator released in  quickly claimed more than ninety per cent of the browser market and andreessen predicted that the web would make operating systems such as microsoft’s windows “irrelevant” when the company went public in  its stock rocketed from twentyeight dollars a share to seventyfive dollars and andreessen was soon on the cover of time barefoot on a throne but marc  was very much in beta having given up coding his first love to manage coders he scarfed pepperidge farm nantuckets and honeycomb cereal straight from the box skipped meetings and blazed up without warning “you’d see him vibrating and it would inspire a combination of excitement and terror” jason rosenthal a manager whom andreessen actually liked recalled a favorite andreessen response to underlings’ confusion was “there are no stupid questions only stupid people” jim barksdale the company’s ceo said “i’d tell marc after meetings ‘you don’t have to tell a dumb sumbitch he’s a dumb sumbitch’ ” andreessen told me “i needed netscape to work it had to work—it was my oneway door—so i was absolutely intolerant of anything that got in the way”—meaning he clarified “people” he could never relax “i am very paranoid and the down cycle hurt a lot more than the up cycle felt good”the down cycle began when microsoft bundled its own browser with its operating system making it the nation’s browser of convenience if not of choice netscape shifted from marketplace to enterprise and began selling browser and server software but it was fortunate to get bought by aol in  for ten billion dollars peter currie the company’s cfo said “we made a difference we invented cookies and pioneered downloading software from the internet yet netscape is an asterisk in business history maybe the best way to think about it is as a classic tech story a company creates invents succeeds—and gets bypassed”in the first “halt and catch fire” episode cardiff’s entrepreneurs go to comdex the big trade show and discover that another company has stolen their idea and beaten them to market in response gordon the hardware engineer removes the interactive operating system from their cardiff machine—a system designed by cameron a punk female software prodigy—and slots in microsoft’s dos which makes the machine ibmcompatible viable and dull it was an excruciating capitulation but andreessen nodded evenly “this was microsoft’s moment and gordon is right—they need to live to fight another day but   ” he pointed at the screen where apple’s macintosh was making its début at the trade show “hello i’m macintosh” the machine said andreessen laughed and continued “they were doomed from the start because apple in cupertino”—in silicon valley—“had spent three years building that i’ve been totally determined to be on the other side of that dynamic by being here because success in software follows a powerlaw distribution it’s not coke and pepsi and a bunch of others it’s winner take all second prize is a set of steak knives and third prize is you’re fired”in the season finale cameron launches her own startup as andreessen watched her manage her coders he said softly “the best scenes with cameron were when she was alone in the basement coding” i said i felt that she was the least satisfactory character underwritten inconsistent lacking in plausible motivation he smiled and replied “because she’s the future”in “why software is eating the world” a widely invoked  oped in the wall street journal andreessen put the most optimistic spin on silicon valley’s tendencies the article proclaimed that tech companies are consuming vast swaths of the economy from books and movies to financial services to agriculture to national defense—which andreessen saw as the healthful scavenging of a carrion way of life on twitter he pursued the theme “posit a world in which all material needs are provided free by robots and material synthesizers    imagine six or  billion people doing nothing but arts and sciences culture and exploring and learning what a world that would be” particularly as “technological progress is precisely what makes a strong rigorous social safety net affordable”andreessen’s telepathic method—extrapolating the future from current trends—may be the best available but it has had doubtful results of the eighteen firms that vcs valued at more than a billion dollars in the heady days of  eleven have gone out of business or have been liquidated in fire sales including home etoys and webvan az bought into zulily an online marketer at a valuation of a billion dollars it soared to a market capitalization of five billion dollars and has since slumped to  billion another billiondollar az company the bargainshopping site fab recently sold for about thirty million dollars on the other hand the firm wrote off the gaming company slack to zero—and then it became an officemessaging app that’s now valued at  billionthe random contingent way that the future comes to pass is a source of endless frustration in the valley sam altman the president of the startup incubator y combinator notes that his early investment in stripe is now worth on paper more than x “so ninetyseven per cent of my returns from  and  are concentrated in one investment which i could easily have missed” he said “i only let myself think about this sort of thing on vacation because if i acknowledged that i was wasting more than ninety per cent of my time—which is true from an economic perspective—i couldn’t get through my days”the key to investing andreessen contends is to be aggressive and to fight your instinct to patternmatch “breakthrough ideas look crazy nuts” he said adding “it’s hard to think this way—i see it in other people’s body language and i can feel it in my own where i sometimes feel like i don’t even care if it’s going to work i can’t take more change” andreessen believes that the major barrier to change is sociological people can embrace only so many new ideas at once “ok google ok twitter—but airbnb people staying in each other’s houses without there being a lot of axe murders”az passed on airbnb’s a round in  reid hoffman the greylock vc who led that round and who is a friend of andreessen’s said “once something like airbnb gets going marc can get a very good sense of it of the economic system—but he’s not necessarily as good at the psychology of why it would get going in the first place”brian chesky airbnb’s cofounder and ceo told me “in  when we were starting to get some traction marc and ben did a oneeighty and were very humble marc said he now saw it through the lens of ebay buying stuff from strangers” az led airbnb’s b round soon afterward the company was battered by headlines about renters who trashed a san francisco home it wasn’t axe murders but chesky said “it was a pr nightmare we had just expanded from being ten people living in a threebedroom apartment and we had no idea how to be a billiondollar company marc came to our office at midnight and read the letter i’d written to our community about the airbnb guarantee and the two changes he made changed the company forever i’d said we guarantee five thousand dollars for property damage and he added a zero which seemed crazy” andreessen also added the proviso that claimants would have to file a police report which he correctly believed would discourage scam artists “and he told me to add my personal email address he gave us permission to be bold”in venture it’s not batting average that matters it’s slugging average boldness is all when google glass appeared az joined a collective to seek out investments and andreessen declared that without the face shield “people are going to find they feel basically naked and lonely” google withdrew the product in january but he would argue so what his thesis is that such az failures as fab and rockmelt and digg and kno are not merely a tolerable byproduct of the risk algorithm but a vital indicator of it it’s fine to have a lousy record of predicting the future most of the time as long as when you’re right you’re really right between  and  a mere  per cent of all venture investments returned at least x the real mistakes aren’t the errors of commission the companies that crash—all you can lose is your investment—but those of omission there were good reasons that az passed on buying twelve per cent of uber in  including a deadline of just hours to make a decision but the firm missed a profit on paper of more than three billion dollarsthe beauty of betting on risky technologies is that you’re sometimes proved right eventually—perhaps we’ll all feel naked without google glass  when reverses occur andreessen tends to believe that he wasn’t wrong so much as overly prescient yet while he professes intellectual comfort with being wrong he never mentions ning a socialnetworking company that he cofounded in  because as he conceded when i asked about the elision “it didn’t do great” and he can be touchy about criticism at one q  a i attended when the interviewer read him a snarky quote from sam biddle a writer who worked for the gossip site valleywag andreessen made a doobiesmoking gesture and plunged an imaginary needle into his vein to suggest the quality of biddle’s thinking being the public face of venture means that you can be challenged on multiple fronts even as you philosophize about ushering in a new age of democracy you also have to make money for your lps and while the ideal startup advances both goals most in truth advance neither the vc bryce roberts told me “it’s an ego game where you want to believe you’re changing the world but how can you write a check to fab and believe that giving people discounted tchotchkes is changing the world”“you two are fired as security guards now gather up your things and escort each other from the building”in  andreessen and horowitz started loudcloud an early cloudcomputing service that booked thirtyseven million dollars in contracts in its first nine months andreessen meanwhile was becoming marc  he shed thirty pounds started wearing ermenegildo zegna suits and traded in his red mustang for a white mercedes “marc  was jim clark” andreessen told me referring to his impulsive cofounder “marc  was trying to get as polished as possible more socialized and marc  is a combo the goal is not to be elegant but to be blunt enough that there’s no confusion i learned the skills from reading all of caro’s lbj books”the dotcom crash hit loudcloud hard and in  it pivoted to become a software company with a new name opsware in  after years of slogging andreessen and horowitz sold the company for  billion andreessen says that the tech crash scarred him “the overwhelming message to our generation in the early nineties was ‘you’re dirty you’re all about grunge—you guys are fucking losers’ then the tech boom hit and it was ‘we are going to do amazing things’ and then the roof caved in and the wisdom was that the internet was a mirage i one hundred per cent believed that because the rejection was so personal—both what everybody thought of me and what i thought of myself i was not depressed but i was growly in retrospect” he concluded “we were five or six years too early”peter thiel who is four years older than andreessen observed that “the late nineties for gen xers in silicon valley was an experience as powerful as the late sixties was for the younger boomers the sixties was a transformative moment that got shortcircuited by nixon and for marc the nineties—when netscape was iconic and he was deeply living the belief that technology was going to inspire liberalization everywhere—was shortcircuited by the superpowerful bust and return of the old economy but marc is very tenacious”andreessen said he learned that while technology improves steadily “psychologically there’s no middle ground—the plane is always headed straight up or straight down” recognizing that he was a poor manager and needing to buffer those emotional and financial swings andreessen saw that the obvious next move was a portfolio of investments in  he and horowitz began angel investing separately and then together they put ten million dollars into fifty companies including facebook twitter and linkedin then andreessen began pushing to start a venture firm “i always thought the entire venture thing was incredibly cool” he told me “going to kleiner perkins”—the firm that funded netscape—“with the high ceilings the markers on the wall of all the great companies they’d ipo’d larry ellison walking through and at  am the biggest buffet you’ve ever seen at a time when i was eating at subway it was the closest thing to a cathedral for nerds” mark zuckerberg told me “when marc started andreessen horowitz i asked him why he didn’t start another company instead and he said ‘it would be like going back to kindergarten’ ”az was designed not merely to succeed but also to deliver payback it would right the wrongs that andreessen and horowitz had suffered as entrepreneurs most of those in their telling came from benchmark capital the firm that funded loudcloud and recently led the a rounds of uber and snapchat—a fivepartner boutique with no backoffice specialists to provide the services they’d craved “we were always the antibenchmark” horowitz told me “our design was to not do what they did” horowitz is still mad that one benchmark partner asked him in front of his cofounders “when are you going to get a real ceo” and that benchmark’s bestknown vc the sixfeeteight bill gurley another outspoken giant with a large twitter following advised horowitz to cut andreessen and his sixmilliondollar investment out of the company andreessen said “i can’t stand him if you’ve seen ‘seinfeld’ bill gurley is my newman”—jerry’s bête noireaz’s services model made a strong impression on sand hill road “andreessen caused us to up our game on the marketing side” sequoia’s doug leone told me “younger founders pay attention to media and we don’t want to be depositioned” sequoia hired an inhouse publicist and two new marketing specialists to complement the four it had and most top firms made similar moves even if they privately believed that az’s services were simply a marketing tool todd mckinnon the ceo of okta said “every firm we talk to now is ‘hey we’re doing all this recruiting and we’ll introduce you to big customers’ it’s become the table stakes”benchmark by contrast took down its web site “it’s like watching coke and pepsi go head to head” one ceo told me bill gurley declined my requests for comment but he has publicly bemoaned all the money that firms such as az are pumping into the system at a time when he and many other vcs worry that the tech sector is experiencing another bubble so many investors from outside the valley want in on the startup world that valuations have been soaring last year thirtyeight us startups received billiondollar valuations twentythree more than in  many vcs have told their companies to raise as much money as possible now to have a buffer against a crashbenchmark’s funds top out at four hundred million dollars and are reserved for earlyround investing the original artisanal venture model az raised  billion each for its third and fourth funds in  and  with much of the money earmarked for later costlier growth rounds whose returns tend to be capped at x andreessen argues that startups now wait longer and raise more capital before going public and az wants to be in those conversations too he also says that larger funds will allow the firm to provide even more of the services that its entrepreneurs crave but in the valley increasing your fund size so dramatically is customarily seen as “smoking your own exhaust” or among those with a classical turn of mind hubris “venture doesn’t scale” diane mulcahy the lp and venture critic said “raising and investing more doesn’t increase the number of billiondollar companies and offering services to entrepreneurs won’t help the firm generate returns it’s like a saks fifth avenue that gives everybody a free iphone are they going to attract everybody and see everybody yes are they going to make money not for long”when i pressed andreessen on az’s fund size he said that even if the basic assumptions haven’t changed—even if only fifteen companies a year reach a hundred million dollars in revenue—those companies generate more money now and he said “i’d bet the number of companies that reach that revenue is going up” with a playful smile he referred to gurley “if there’s no profit opportunity beyond the first four hundred million bill’s making the case that everyone who follows benchmark in a later investment round is a moron i wouldn’t say that”one morning as i sat down to breakfast with andreessen a rival vc sent me a long email about az’s holdings the vc estimated that because andreessen’s firm had taken so many growth positions its average ownership stake was roughly  per cent it’s eight per cent which meant that to get x to x across its four funds “you would need your aggregate portfolio to be worth b” you would in other words need to invest in every facebook and uber that came along when i started to check the math with andreessen he made a jerkingoff motion and said “blahblahblah we have all the models—we’re elephant hunting going after big game”in addition to assuaging various slights from vcs andreessen is attempting to assuage the wound of the  crash by maintaining that it was an isolated event “the argument in favor of concern is cyclical” he told me—busts follow booms “the counterargument is that stuff works now in  you had fifty million people on the internet and the number of smartphones was zero today you have three billion internet users and two billion smartphones it’s pong versus nintendo it’s carlota perez’s argument that technology is adopted on an s curve the installation phase the crash—because the technology isn’t ready yet—and then the deployment phase when technology gets adopted by everyone and the real money gets made” so the  tech crash prefigured not the next crash but a sustained boom and andreessen’s portfolio like the entire sand hill road enterprise wasn’t so much overpriced as underappreciated“we even tried a visit from a celebrity”still he recently tweeted that startups were spending too much when the market turns he wrote “nobody will want to buy your cashincinerating startup there will be no plan b vaporize” and come to think of it maybe it wasn’t prudent to raise too much either in one pitch meeting where a portfolio company sought a billiondollar growth round andreessen raised his arms overhead and made an explosive sound to warn of what can happen when your valuation vastly exceeds your revenues “thanks for playing—game over” the company went on to secure its round with only a token contribution from az andreessen later said that as in an increasing number of deals growth investors had paid one round ahead of progress—paid in other words for the results they hoped to see in the following round though the company’s lofty valuation buoyed az’s portfolio his body language suggested that buying at such valuations was maybe not smart—“but as long as they’re sophisticated investors it’s not our job to moralize on whether they’re overpaying”another way of framing the growthfunding question peter thiel suggests is that andreessen may not be as suited to making early counterintuitive investments as he is—a point that andreessen concedes “peter is just smarter than i am and in a lateral way” but thiel says andreessen is well positioned because of his broad knowledge and flexible mindset to respond to incremental changes in an array of fields and that he argues is what the times reward “while twitter is a lesser innovation than flying cars it’s a much more valuable business we live in a financial age not a technological age”in december apoorva mehta the founder of a grocerydelivery app called instacart came to az to ask it to fill out his c round the firm had led mehta’s b round with an investment of twentyseven million dollars but he reminded the team anyway that instacart “is quite a magical experience” then he invoked a few sharingeconomy shibboleths including “we don’t have any infrastructure” “mobilepowered independent contractors” and “machinelearningbased fulfillment engine” in two years mehta had set up in fifteen cities signed up many of the independent grocery chains including whole foods and showed profitability in a number of stores and it was a defensible network because he installed refrigerated lockers in the stores at the same time because mehta had recently changed his model instacart was losing money on each delivery and that amount was growing as he rapidly expanded into new marketsandreessen applied a disinfecting wipe and said “let me ask you a question i know the answer to in  there was no more flaming debacle of a business than grocery delivery online you were probably twelve at the time of webvan”“thirteen” mehta said“so why now”“the main reason is you have access to labor through smartphones it’s the same reason uber and lyft exist now”andreessen nodded with satisfaction “you can orchestrate the entire supply chain through your phone” webvan was what he called a “ghost story”—a cautionary tale that still frightened investors but instacart proved that even haunted houses could be rehabilitatedanother partner asked about competitors including uber taskrabbit amazon fresh and fresh direct “the other older models can’t do instant delivery” mehta replied “and the newer ones don’t have anywhere near our coverage and range of data in groceries so if you want slower delivery and smaller selection go with them” andreessen smiled savoring the contemptat the deal review jeff jordan who sits on instacart’s board praised mehta’s progress while noting concerns about unit economics—how he’d get to profitability on each delivery referring to the venture community’s enthusiasm for the round jordan went on “this is an ‘i missed uber i don’t want to miss the next one’ climate” balancing everything he recommended that the firm put in ten million dollarshorowitz argued for a bigger investment mehta’s moat against competitors “is really fucking deep—he already has whole foods monster of monsters it’s the biggest market of all time incredibly huge”after other partners argued that the valuation seemed high andreessen looked at horowitz “ben i think you’re making an even more provocative point than people understand it sounds like you’re saying this could be an uber for real”“i think so” horowitz said “what makes unit economics really scary is if you’re in a competitive market he’s in a monopoly”andreessen said “we could go to the well and go in higher” he beckoned coaxingly horowitz thought it over then said “i don’t want to override jeff” andreessen too seemed content to temper his enthusiasm and to share the round with other firms mehta eventually raised two hundred and twenty million dollars on a valuation of two billion he’d like to make twenty times the investments the firm does but every opportunity comes with an opportunity cost and even  billion doesn’t last foreverandrew golden the chief investment officer for princeton university an lp in az’s last three funds told me that when the firm started “my worry was that marc is such a big personality he wouldn’t necessarily listen to someone who told him he was wearing fewer clothes than he thought but now my working hypothesis is that marc is smart enough to know that he’ll do better if he doesn’t try to win every argument—if he doesn’t try to go undefeated”in march andreessen and his wife announced the birth of their son who’d been carried to term by a gestational surrogate they named him john for laura’s father “i feel fantastic” andreessen told me “he’ll come of age in a world where ten or a hundred times more people will be able to contribute in science and medicine and the arts a more peaceful and prosperous world” he added tongue in cheek “i’m going to teach him how to take over that world”andreessen often remarks that in the bluecollar milieu he came from no parent wants his or her child to stay bluecollar his own circumstances have changed dramatically—he is now a paper billionaire though he argues that his net worth depends on how you value az—so i told him it seemed paradoxical that some of his other babies such as instacart and lyft make their profits off bluecollar drivers and pickers who must freelance without a safety net to make ends meet unsurprisingly he strongly disagreed “maybe there’s an alternate way of living a freeform life where you press the button and get work when you want to”one afternoon as we sat at his baronial dining table he made an agonized but sincere effort to discuss his bluecollar childhood without mentioning his nuclear family “i really identified with charles schulz in the david michaelis biography of him ‘schulz and peanuts’ ” he said i was struck by the parallels between andreessen and both “peanuts”—in which charlie brown has a massive bald head and the parents are kept offstage—and its creator charles schulz who grew up in minnesota was socially awkward hated being embraced and loathed his mother’s norwegian relatives a farming family andreessen went on “ninetysix per cent of the people who grow up like he and i did in the midwest just stay there but the ones who leave”—the cartoonist too moved to california—“become intensely interested in the future in schulz’s last ten years he really focussed on rerun linus’s younger brother—the youngest and most optimistic character”i told andreessen that this seemed like a tendentious reading of rerun a bland character whose two most famous lines are “i’ll drink to that” and “my brother is the only one in the family with a blanket and i don’t want to end up like him” taken aback he explained “he’s the youngest he’s the newest he has the most life in front of him” andreessen as he saw himself was both an immigrant to the land of opportunity like the entrepreneurs he preferred to fund and someone whose childhood was merely an installation phase he told me “it wasn’t that i felt misunderstood or badly treated it was that i was so completely different i wasn’t seeking understanding i wasn’t indexing myself against the people around me”andreessen reminded me—in his formidable achievements and manner his thickly armored sensitivities and yearnings—of rilke’s remark “perhaps everything that frightens us is in its deepest essence something helpless that wants our love” when i told him so he stared back in absolute horrorlast year a programmer named alex payne wrote an open letter to andreessen in which he observed “people are scared of so much wealth and control being in so few hands consequently wherever you and other gatekeepers of capital direct your attention—towards robots d printers biotech whatever—you’re going to detect a fearful response as people scramble to determine the impact of your decisions and whims” which only compound “lingering structural unemployment and an accumulation of capital at the top of the economic pyramid”“good evening ladies and gentlemen if i may have just a moment of your time—my name is edward and i’ll be sitting here reading the paper with my mouth shut thank you for you time have a good evening and god bless”payne addressed his thoughts to andreessen because andreessen represents the valley—both in its soaring vision and in its tendency to treat people as a fungible mass but andreessen waved away the criticisms as the ravings of “a selfhating software engineer” when i persisted he said “ordinary people love the iphone facebook google search airbnb and lyft it’s only the intellectuals who worry” he raised counterarguments then dismissed them technology would solve any environmental crisis hastened by an expanding economy and as for the notion that as he said “ ‘you american imperialist asshole not everyone wants all that technology’—well bullshit go to a chinese village and ask them” technology gives us superpowers makes us smarter more powerful happier “would the world be a better place if there were fifty silicon valleys” he said “obviously yes over the past thirty years the level of income throughout the developing world is rising the number of people in poverty is shrinking health outcomes are improving birth rates are falling and it’ll be even better in ten years pessimism always sounds more sophisticated than optimism—it’s the edencollapse myth over and over again—and then you look at gdp per capita worldwide and it’s up and to the right if this is collapse let’s have more of it”global unemployment is rising too—this seems to be the first industrial revolution that wipes out more jobs than it creates one  paper argues that fortyseven per cent of all american jobs are destined to be automated andreessen argues that his firm’s entire portfolio is creating jobs and that such companies as udacity which offers lowcost online “nanodegrees” in programming and honor which aims to provide better and betterpaid inhome care for the elderly bring us closer to a future in which everyone will either be doing more interesting work or be kicking back and painting sunsets but when i brought up the raft of data suggesting that intracountry inequality is in fact increasing even as it decreases when averaged across the globe—america’s wealth gap is the widest it’s been since the government began measuring it—andreessen rerouted the conversation saying that such gaps were “a skills problem” and that as robots ate the old boring jobs humanity should simply retool “my response to larry summers when he says that people are like horses they have only their manual labor to offer”—he threw up his hands “that is such a dark and dim and dystopian view of humanity i can hardly stand it”one challenge for andreessen is whether venture itself has a skills problem if software is truly eating the world wouldn’t venture capital be on the menu the angellist platform now allows investors to fund startups online its cofounder naval ravikant said that “future companies will require more twohundredthousanddollar checks and way fewer guys on sand hill road” jeff fagnan of atlas venture which is the largest investor in angellist said “software is already squeezing out other intermediaries—travel agents financial advisers—and at the end of the day vcs are intermediaries we’re all just selling cash”andreessen sometimes wonders if ravikant is onto something he’s asked horowitz “what if we’re the most evolved dinosaur and naval is a bird” already more than half the tech companies that reached a billiondollar valuation in the past decade were based outside silicon valley and as andreessen himself wrote in  before he became a vc “odds are nothing your vc does no matter how helpful or wellintentioned is going to tip the balance between success and failure”he still believes that—but he also thinks that az can cut a company’s time to success in half and time is money he also believes that venture will maintain its incumbency because computers can’t yet introduce you to just the right engineer or chief information officer at ebay and machines can’t yet come to your office at midnight to futureproof your letter to perturbed customers indeed venture is one of the most human businesses going only human beings could have created such a supercollider of contradictions a font of innovation that pools around conformity a freedom train that speeds toward monopoly a promoter of transparency that shrouds its own dealings a guild that’s dedicated to flattening hierarchies and that rewards its leaders with imperial powernaturally andreessen had to weigh the counterargument and consider whether he added any value at all one sunday afternoon as he sat alone at the head of az’s conference table he said “chris dixon argues that we’re in the magicalproducts business—that we fool ourselves into thinking we’re building companies but it doesn’t matter if we don’t have the magical products” and magic could not be summoned only prepared for “over twenty years” he continued “our returns are going to come down to two or three or four investments and the rest of this”—his gesture took in the building full of art the devotions of more than a hundred eager souls even the fauxmoorish rooftops of his competitors down the road—“is the cost of getting the chance at those investments there’s a sense in which all of this is math—you just don’t know which tuesday mark zuckerberg is going to walk in”yet math was no help with mass psychology “even if we could do perfect analysis we just can’t know the future” he said “what if google ventures had access to all google searches—could you predict hit products or perfect access to all of people’s conversations or purchases you still wouldn’t know what’s going to happen how is psychohistory going” he went on referring to isaac asimov’s invention in his “foundation” novels of a statistical field that could predict the behavior of civilizations “not very fucking good at all which by the way is part of what makes this job really fun it’s a people business if we could revise the industry completely we’d just dump all the business plans and focus on people—the twentythreeyearold mark zuckerberg bill gates steve jobs”he acknowledged though that his optimism dims once human beings—with their illogic hidden agendas and sheer bugginess—enter the equation “we’re imperfect people pursuing perfect ideas and there’s tremendous frustration in the gap” he said “writing code one or two people that’s the platonic ideal but when you want to impact the world you need one hundred people then one thousand then ten thousand—and people have all these people issues” he examined the problem in silence “a world of just computers wouldn’t work” he concluded wistfully “but a world of just people could certainly be improved” ♦an earlier version of this article misstated the name of sequoia capitalmost popularnews deskwhat the layoffs look like at the carrier plant trump said he’d

with the audience flag  things about productmarket fit – andreessen horowitz skip to content software is eating the world search how innovation happens  things about productmarket fit guest post by tren griffin the productmarket fit pmf concept was developed and named by andy rachleff who is currently the ceo and cofounder of wealthfront and is a cofounder of benchmark capital the core of rachleff’s idea for pmf was based on his analysis of the investing style of the pioneering venture capitalist and sequoia founder don valentine why market matters more than anything  “give me a giant market — always” “arthur rock is the representative of you find a great entrepreneur and you back him my position has always been you find a great market and you build multiple companies in that market” “our view has always preferably been give us a technical problem give us a big market when that technical problem is solved so we can sell lots and lots and lots of stuff do i like to do that with terrific people sure are we unwilling to invest in companies that don’t have them sure we invested in apple when steve jobs was about eighteen or nineteen years old — not only didn’t he go to harvard business school he didn’t go to any school” don valentine one way to look at venture capital investing and creating a valuable business is as an effort to build a stool with three legs people markets and innovative products all three legs are required for success but different venture capitalists and entrepreneurs emphasize and weight each of the three core elements differently at different times while valentine believed that yes of course you need decent people “the marketplace comes first because you can’t change that but you can change the people” according to pitch johnson who was a venture capital industry pioneer at the same time valentine was developing his investing style a famous example of changing people was when the cisco board of directors replaced the thenhusbandandwife team who founded the company in other cases new team members are brought in to supply new skills instead of replacing people eric schmidt being recruited to google is a famous example of that approach what is productmarket fit really  “a value hypothesis is an attempt to articulate the key assumption that underlies why a customer is likely to use your product identifying a compelling value hypothesis is what i call finding productmarket fit a value hypothesis identifies the features you need to build the audience that’s likely to care and the business model required to entice a customer to buy your product companies often go through many iterations before they find productmarket fit if they ever do” “when a great team meets a lousy market market wins when a lousy team meets a great market market wins when a great team meets a great market something special happens” “if you address a market that really wants your product — if the dogs are eating the dog food — then you can screw up almost everything in the company and you will succeed conversely if you’re really good at execution but the dogs don’t want to eat the dog food you have no chance of winning” andy rachleff one way to rephrase a key point rachleff is making is to say that that nothing is as irreplaceable as a great market in saying this no one is saying this means that a great team isn’t an accelerant to what a great market can enable the modified gary larson cartoon at right captures this idea nor is anyone rejecting the idea that pmf is needed there are other venture capitalists like pitch johnson and arthur rock who put the quality of entrepreneurs first but it’s a matter of emphasis and timing rachleff observes that if you look at the most successful startups they actually didn’t have “the world’s best management teams in the very early days they happened to have conceived or more likely pivoted into an idea that addresses an amazing point of pain around which consumers where desperate for a solution” the process behind productmarket fit  “you often stumble into your productmarket fit serendipity plays a role in finding productmarket fit but the process to get to serendipity is incredibly consistent what we do is teach that incredibly consistent process” andy rachleff even though serendipity plays a role here there is a process — which is why rachleff later created and teaches a course at stanford aligning startups with their markets steve blank also developed a customer development process based on the idea that startups should apply the scientific method just like scientists do start with a hypothesis test it prove it move on or further iterate on the hypothesis similarly rachleff observes that “first you need to define and test your value hypothesis and then only once proven do you move on to your growth hypothesis the value hypothesis defines the what the who and the how what are you going to build who is desperate for it and what is the business model you are going to use to deliver it” startups should therefore start with the product and try to find the market as opposed to starting with the market to find the product it’s important to emphasize here that the iteration is more about the market and the business model than the product itself finally as reid hoffman notes “productmarket fit requires you to figure out the earliest tells” using an analogy to poker is appropriate since the process finding pmf fit is an art rather than a science pmf emerges from experiments conducted by the entrepreneurs through a series of buildmeasurelearn iterations pmf is discovered and developed during a process rather than a single eureka moment aha moments of inspiration do happen but pmf is not created that way how can you tell whether you do or don’t have productmarket fit  “you can always feel when productmarket fit isn’t happening the customers aren’t quite getting value out of the product word of mouth isn’t spreading usage isn’t growing that fast press reviews are kind of ‘blah’ the sales cycle takes too long and lots of deals never close and you can always feel productmarket fit when it’s happening the customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it — or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers money from customers is piling up in your company checking account you’re hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can reporters are calling because they’ve heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk to you about it you start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from harvard business school investment bankers are staking out your house you could eat free for a year at buck’s” marc andreessen according to andreessen “productmarket fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market” but too often the focus is on latter part of the sentence a product that can satisfy the market and not the former in a good market andreessen emphasizes that market matters most “you can obviously screw up a great market — and that has been done and not infrequently — but assuming the team is baseline competent and the product is fundamentally acceptable a great market will tend to equal success and a poor market will tend to equal failure” that’s why time spent building a business around the product alone is pointless “best case it’s going to be a zombie … in a terrible market you can have the best product in the world and an absolutely killer team and it doesn’t matter – you’re going to fail you’ll break your pick for years trying to find customers who don’t exist for your marvelous product and your wonderful team will eventually get demoralized and quit and your startup will die” the converse is also true you can have an ok team and a buggy and incomplete product but if the market is great and you are the best product available success can happen both suddenly and quickly that success won’t last unless those products are fixed but at least the business has the beginnings of something wonderful  “the term productmarket fit describes ‘the moment when a startup finally finds a widespread set of customers that resonate with its product’” eric ries  the “satisfy the market” part of the andreessen definition is where the pmf concept necessarily starts to get qualitative various math tests have been devised in an attempt to quantify pmf but they are proxies for something that is fundamentally like justice stewart’s famous definition of pornography “i know it when i see it” even if there is a best practices test for whether pmf exists that does not mean that creating pmf can be reduced to a formula so what are considered some of the best tests for pmf rachleff writes that “you know you have fit if your product grows exponentially with no marketing that is only possible if you have huge word of mouth word of mouth is only possible if you have delighted your customer” tying together the concepts rachleff also shares that entrepreneurs too often confuse productmarket fit with growth in what ries calls vanity metrics “numbers or stats that look good on paper but don’t really mean anything important” so what does rachleff suggests net promoter score nps as a great tool to predict the magnitude of customer love for one’s productservice — ideally a score of  or higher “to know you’re on the right track” however while nps is a pretty good proxy for likely fit it is “not nearly as accurate as having market feedback in the form of purchases” people vote with their dollars after all  “the number one problem i’ve seen for startups is they don’t actually have productmarket fit when they think they do” alex schultz many founders seem to believe that what they have developed is the modern equivalent of magic beans and that people will accept them as payment for a cow my post last weekend on growth talks about the need for an offering to have core product value chamath palihapitiya believes that a value hypothesis is driven by core product value — “what the market desires about a product” … but that it “is elusive and most products don’t have any” and in fact rachleff has observed that this is where technology inflection points can play a role “truly great technology companies are the result of an inflection point in technology that allows the founder to conceive a new kind of product the question then is who wants to buy my product”  marc andreessen writes “in a great market — a market with lots of real potential customers — the market pulls product out of the startup” ideally in the easiest stages of a product development process pull is happening organically ie without any advertising spending common misconceptions about productmarket fit  “first to market seldom matters rather first to productmarket fit is almost always the longterm winner” “time after time the winner is the first company to deliver the food the dogs want to eat” “once a company has achieved product market fit it is extremely difficult to dislodge it even with a better or less expensive product” andy rachleff rachleff has cited examples like intuit apple and google as examples of how being the first mover isn’t necessarily the advantage here facebook was not the first social network either finding product market fit is a process that is not unlike “creating a ‘dance’ between the product and the market” as mike maples jr has described it it also involves taking the most powerful and compelling aspects of the product and delivering them in the form of ‘wtf’ level features that are not merely compelling – they rise to the level of changing people’s points of view about what’s even possible and create intense delight in customers” to reach that level the target isn’t just productmarket fit but “productmarket scale” observes casey winters as i explained in my previous post on growth facebook has a superior approach to generating growth and in a business with network effects that not only captures customers and changed points of view but keeps out competitors  “productmarket fit myths myth  product market fit is always a discrete big bang event myth  it’s patently obvious when you have productmarket fit myth  once you achieve productmarket fit you can’t lose it and myth  once you have productmarket fit you don’t have to sweat the competition” ben horowitz even though tight productmarket fit and productmarket scale help beat out the completion that doesn’t mean that the struggle stops there markets and the actions of competitors in that market which are not always visible to outsiders are always changing constant adaptation is therefore required to retain pmf steve blank observes “what matters is having forward momentum and a tight factbased datametrics feedback loop to help you quickly recognize and reverse any incorrect decisions” one mistake many people make is to believe that the process described in feedback loop diagrams does not apply to them the reason the process is depicted as a circle is that it is both iterative and continuous it is highly unlikely that even a hundred internal whiteboard product planning sessions will result in a product that has perfect pmf from the start  “getting product right means finding productmarket fit it does not mean launching the product it means getting to the point where the market accepts your product and wants more of it” fred wilson one of the most common ways that startups die is “premature scaling” a term first used by steve blank a business is “scaling prematurely” if it is spending significant amounts of money on growth before it has discovered and developed pmf steve blank describes one important reason why premature scaling can happen “ironically one of the greatest risks … is high pressure expectations to make these first pass forecasts that subvert an honest customer development process the temptation is to transform the vision of a large market into a solid corporate revenue forecast — before customer development even begins” a study conducted by startup genome concluded “startups need  times longer to validate their market than most founders expect this underestimation creates the pressure to scale prematurely… in our dataset we found that  of startups scaled prematurely along some dimension while this number seemed high this may go a long way towards explaining the  failure rate of startups” an entrepreneur quoted by the authors of the study said “premature scaling is putting the cart before the proverbial horse…as an entrepreneur there’s always the temptation to grow the sales team at the first sign of revenue traction but there is always the danger that this early traction is coming from the subset of the market that are early adopters and not the actual market itself additionally too often i’ve seen startups ramp up sales before they’ve figured out the most efficient way to achieve profitability a vicious cycle ensues wherein the more a company grows the more it farther away from profitability it becomes” viddy is often cited as an example of a company that died of premature scaling for a period of time viddy was able to use facebook opengraph to grow its user base to millions of users before it ever had pmf that mistake eventually meant the company was sold for very little and it faded away like the cheshire cat other business that suffered from premature scaling included friendster orkut and digg groupon suffered from premature scaling but was able to pivot and save itself so far by the way not everyone uses this premature scaling terminology for example if you look at this list of reasons why startups fail from cb insights premature scaling is not even listed but is perhaps buried in other categories as an aside “pivot gone bad” is a popular country western song written by a founder who wrote “my cofounder left with my husband and i’m sure going to miss her” how to get there  “in the early days of a product don’t focus on making it robust find product market fit first then harden” jeff lawson again the process is discoverybased and experimentation is required there is no value in hardening something that customers don’t want to buy andreessen argues that “the product doesn’t need to be great it just has to basically work and the market doesn’t care how good the team is as long as the team can produce that viable product” if nearly everyone at the business is focused on trying to fulfill product demand instead of “siting around” trying to dream up new feature to create demand there is almost certainly pmf — but the reverse is not the case pmf is not a magic elixir it signifies an important milestone that is necessary but not sufficient for success once a company has pmf it still must find a sustainable growth model and create a moat against competitors and so on what pmf does do is help prevent businesses from spending money trying to grow a business often inorganically in a way that is doomed to fail  “in general hiring before you get productmarket fit slows you down and hiring after you get product market fit speeds you up until you get productmarket fit you want to a live as long as possible and b iterate as quickly as possible” sam altman what altman is saying is reflected in what cofounder jessica livingston calls the y combinator motto “make something that people want if you create something and no one uses it you’re dead nothing else you do is going to matter if people don’t like your product” andreessen argues that the life of any startup can be divided into two parts before productmarket fit what he calls bpmf and after productmarket fit apmf “when you are bpmf focus obsessively on getting to productmarket fit do whatever is required to get to productmarket fit including changing out people rewriting your product moving into a different market telling customers no when you don’t want to telling customers yes when you don’t want to raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital — whatever is required when you get right down to it you can ignore almost everything else i’m not suggesting that you do ignore everything else — just that judging from what i’ve seen in successful startups you can  “founders have to choose a market long before they have any idea whether they will reach productmarket fit” chris dixon some venture capitalists want to see productmarket fit before they invest and leave it to angels to do the investing preproduct market fit they would rather buy a business with productmarket fit than try to predict whether a founder will find it key as always is for the venture capitalist to let the founders do the heavy lifting “you do not want a venture capitalist who hire a dog and then tries to do the barking” the key point dixon makes is that founders have control over this by thinking carefully about what they’re trying to do and why there is
