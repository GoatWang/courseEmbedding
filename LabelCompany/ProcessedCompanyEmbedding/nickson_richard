with the war’s length and the devastation it had caused lyndon johnson even refused to run again in  partially due to the unpopularity of the vietnam war richard nixon inherited the conflict and also had to deal with the negative view of government present in the american culture of the era the main issue of the watergate scandal was a break in that occurred at the democratic national committee headquarters dnc the headquarters was in a building complex called “watergate” in washington dc nixon suffered from massive paranoia he felt that there was a “liberal” conspiracy against him and his presidential policies nixon was allowing men in his administration to illegally wiretap various people to try and get information on this so called conspiracy nixon a republican entrusted himself to a few close advisors hr haldeman chief of staff john ehrlichman domestic advisor john deal presidential counsel and john mitchell attorney general were some of his closest consultants nixon was frustrated with the various negotiations that were needed to deal with the congress that was dominated by democrats he wanted to get the upper hand on their plans he allowed mean to break the law by illegally attempting to spy on those nixon believed were in the conspiracy against him since the s nixon possessed massive paranoia toward his political rivals due to losing to jfk nixon was frantic to make sure he stayed ahead politically in june of  five men were caught breaking in to the democratic national committee headquarters these men were trying to copy files and plant “bugs” that could record future conversations in the office james mccord one of the intruders was a former cia agent and helped with the committee to reelect the president crp hr haldeman and others began to destroy documents that linked nixon to the break in the committee to reelect the president crp illegally used campaign money to pay the intruders to keep them quiet about asserting nixon knew of their tactics the washington post followed the story two reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein covered the events despite the story nixon won the  election and defeated democrat george s mcgovern a senate investigation commenced nixon tried to fire haldeman and claimed the watergate intruders acted outside of his orders nixon then went on television and denied that he knew about the break in john dean admitted the president knew of the break in at watergate he also confessed that nixon had conversations with him about how to cover up the scandal afterward it was revealed that the paranoid president had taped various meetings on various matters including his illegal political strategies in what was called the saturday night massacre nixon was ordered to give up the tapes by the supreme court but he refused congress began to consider impeaching nixon in  nixon said he would release the tapes if they could be edited the supreme court ruled they had to be released without editing on august th  before congress could impeach him nixon resigned as president gerald ford nixon’s vice president became president of the usa many went to jail over watergate and other scandals affiliated with the nixon administration yet ford pardoned nixon of all crimes ford said a trial of the president would just damage the nation more and that he wanted to end the watergate scandal once and for all so the

ended on august   when he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office the first us president ever to do so he was succeeded by vice president gerald ford who had become vice president nine months earlier following spiro agnews resignation from office a republican nixon took office after the  presidential election in which he defeated hubert humphrey the then–incumbent vice president four years later in  he won reelection in a landslide victory over george mcgovern nixon the th united states president succeeded lyndon b johnson who had launched the great society a set of domestic programs financed and run by the federal government in contrast nixon advocated a new federalism domestic program model one in which certain powers would devolve back to the states the creation of the epa passage of the endangered species act and the integration of southern public schools happened during his presidency as did the end of military draft and the apollo program which successfully landed americans on the moon nixons primary focus while in office was on foreign affairs his foreign policy agenda known as the nixon doctrine called for indirect assistance to american allies in the cold war with the vietnamization of the vietnam war being the most notable example of his doctrine nixon pursued a detente with the peoples republic of china taking advantage of the sinosoviet split and significantly altering the nature of the cold war nixon also signed the antiballistic missile treaty and salt i two landmark arms control treaties with the soviet union nixons domestic and foreign policy accomplishments as president were however largely overshadowed by the scandals that enveloped his administration nixon was forced to resign from office after congress began impeachment proceedings in reaction to the watergate scandal he remains the only president to ever resign from office regarding his lasting legacy historian stephen ambrose wrote

republican convention the early favorite for the partys presidential nomination was michigan governor george romney later that year however his prospects foundered on the issue of vietnam and by the end of  nixon was according to time magazine the man to beat nixon entered the new year confident that with the democrats torn apart over the war in vietnam a republican had a good chance of winning although he expected the election to be as close as in  nixon won a resounding victory in the first republican party primary on march  in new hampshire winning  of the vote antiwar republicans wrote in the name of new york governor nelson rockefeller the leader of the gops liberal wing who received  of the vote he later defeated nixon in the massachusetts primary on april  but otherwise fared poorly in the state primaries and conventions that spring california governor ronald reagan emerged as the leading voice of republican conservatism attaining second place in two primaries and winning the contest in his home state at the republican national convention in miami beach florida reagan and rockefeller discussed joining forces in a stopnixon movement with each hoping to be nominated in a brokered convention no such movement materialized and nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot he selected maryland governor spiro agnew as his running mate a choice which nixon believed would unite the party appealing to both northern moderates and southerners disaffected with the democrats nixons acceptance speech was a message of hope we extend the hand of friendship to all people to the soviet people to the chinese people to all the people of the world and we work toward the goal of an open world open sky open cities open hearts open minds democrats began  expecting that president johnson who was constitutionally eligible for election to a second full term under the provisions of the nd amendment would again be the partys presidential nominee those expectations were shattered by senator eugene mccarthy who had entered the campaign late in november to give voice to those in the party opposed to johnsons vietnam policies mccarthy narrowly lost to johnson in the first democratic party primary on march  in new hampshire winning  of the vote to johnsons  the results startled the party establishment and spurred senator robert f kennedy of new york to enter the race two weeks later johnson told a stunned the nation that he would not seek a second term in the weeks that followed much of the momentum that had been moving the mccarthy campaign forward shifted toward kennedy this one of the most tumultuous democratic primary election seasons in modern times concluded with kennedy being assassination on june  in los angeles following a rally celebrating his victory in the california primary vice president hubert humphrey who announced his candidacy in late april saying he would run on the kennedyjohnson record but would be his own man won the presidential nomination at democratic national convention in chicago senator edmund muskie of maine was selected as his running mate outside the convention hall thousands of young antiwar activists who had gathered to protest the vietnam war clashed violently with police the mayhem which had been broadcast to the world in television crippled the humphrey campaign postconvention labor day surveys had humphrey trailing nixon by more than  percentage points  electoral vote results in addition to nixon and humphrey the race was joined by former democratic alabama governor george wallace a vocal segregationist who ran on the american independent party ticket throughout the campaign nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval he appealed to what he later called the silent majority of socially conservative americans who disliked the hippie counterculture and the antiwar demonstrators agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups solidifying nixons position with the right nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign meeting with supporters in front of cameras he stressed that the crime rate was too high and attacked what he perceived as a surrender by the democrats of the united states nuclear superiority nixon promised peace with honor in the vietnam war and proclaimed that new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the pacific he did not release specifics of how he hoped to end the war resulting in media intimations that he must have a secret plan his slogan of nixons the one proved to be effective in a threeway race nixon defeated humphrey by about  votes –  to  wallace received  of the vote in the electoral college nixons victory was substantial he secured  votes to humphrey’s  and  for wallace including one faithless elector in north carolina who had been pledged to nixon in his victory speech nixon pledged that his administration would try to bring the divided nation

achieving détente with the peoples republic of china and the soviet union virtually assured the republican nomination polls showed that he held a strong lead in the republican primaries he was challenged in the primaries by pete mccloskey from california who ran as a antiwar candidate and john ashbrook who opposed nixons détente policy in the new hampshire primary mccloskey garnered  of the

expected his democratic opponent to be senator ted kennedy of massachusetts but he was largely removed from contention after the  chappaquiddick incident instead senator edmund muskie of maine was the front runner with senator george mcgovern of south dakota in a close second place in the end mcgovern won the nomination at the democratic national convention senator thomas eagleton of missouri was the vicepresidential choice but after it was disclosed that he had undergone mental health treatment including electroshock therapy in the past eagleton withdrew from the race mcgovern replaced him with sargent shriver of maryland a kennedy inlaw nixon dismissed the democratic platform as cowardly and divisive mcgovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights with some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization mcgovern was perceived as standing for amnesty abortion and acid mcgovern was also damaged by his choosing and then rejecting eagleton nixon ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle focused on the prospect of peace in vietnam and an upsurge in the economy he was elected to a second term on november   in one of the largest landslide election victories in american history he won over  of the popular vote receiving  votes to mcgovern’s  and won an even larger electoral college

trips to several eastern european communist nations including romania  yugoslavia  and the soviet union  and  asiaedit chinaedit main article  nixon visit to china president nixon shakes hands with chinese premier zhou enlai upon arriving in beijing even those who opposed nixon occasionally praise his work in china the extent to which his visit had any profound consequences of note however remain very much open to debate nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to china prior to becoming president writing the before his election that there is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation assisting him in this venture was his national security advisor and future secretary of state henry kissinger with whom the president worked closely bypassing cabinet officials with relations between the soviet union and china at a nadir—border clashes between the two took place during nixons first year in office—nixon sent private word to the chinese through pakistan a country friendly to both china and united states that he desired closer relations with the chinese a breakthrough came in early  when chairman mao invited a team of american table tennis players to visit china and play against top chinese players nixon followed up by sending kissinger to china for clandestine meetings with chinese officials on july   it was simultaneously announced by beijing and by nixon on television and radio that the president would visit china the following february the announcements astounded the world the secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact in february  president and mrs nixon traveled to china kissinger briefed nixon for over  hours in preparation upon touching down the president and first lady emerged from air force one and greeted chinese premier zhou enlai nixon made a point of shaking zhous hand something which thensecretary of state john foster dulles had refused to do in  when the two met in geneva over  television journalists accompanied the president on nixons orders television was strongly favored over printed publications as nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print it also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised nixon and kissinger met for an hour with mao and zhou at maos official private residence where they discussed a range of issues mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by nixon whom he considered forthright unlike the leftists and the soviets he also said he was suspicious of kissinger though the national security advisor referred to their meeting as his encounter with history a formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the great hall of the people the following day nixon met with zhou during this meeting he stated that he believed “there is one china and taiwan is a part of china” when not in meetings nixon toured architectural wonders including the forbidden city ming tombs and the great wall americans received their first glimpse into chinese life through the cameras which accompanied pat nixon who toured the city of beijing and visited communes schools factories and hospitals the visit ushered in a new era of sinoamerican relations fearing the possibility of a sinoamerican alliance the soviet union yielded to pressure for détente with the united states vietnamedit main articles vietnam war operation menu and role of the united states in the vietnam war at the time nixon took office about  american soldiers were dying each week in vietnam and the war was broadly unpopular in the united states with widespread sometimes violent protests against the war taking place on a regular basis including a protest at nixons inauguration the johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions but this agreement never fully took force according to walter isaacson soon after taking office nixon had concluded that the vietnam war could not be won and he was determined to end the war quickly conversely black argues that nixon sincerely believed he could intimidate north vietnam through the madman theory nixon sought some arrangement which would permit american forces to withdraw while leaving south vietnam secure against attack in mid nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the north vietnamese sending a personal letter to north vietnamese leaders and peace talks began in paris initial talks however did not result in an agreement in july  nixon visited south vietnam where he met with his us military commanders and president nguyen van thieu amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout he implemented a strategy of replacing american troops with vietnamese troops known as vietnamization he soon instituted phased us troop withdrawals but authorized incursions into laos in part to interrupt the ho chi minh trail used to supply north vietnamese forces that passed through laos and cambodia nixon announced the ground invasion of cambodia to the american public on april   his responses to protesters included an impromptu early morning meeting with them at the lincoln memorial on may   documents uncovered from the soviet archives after  reveal that the north vietnamese attempt to overrun cambodia in  was launched at the explicit request of the khmer rouge and negotiated by pol pots then second in command nuon chea nixons campaign promise to curb the war contrasted with the escalated bombing led to claims that nixon had a credibility gap on the issue in  excerpts from the pentagon papers which had been leaked by daniel ellsberg were published by the new york times and the washington post when news of the leak first appeared nixon was inclined to do nothing the papers a history of united states involvement in vietnam mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations he was persuaded by kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared and the president tried to prevent publication the supreme court eventually ruled for the newspapers as us troop withdrawals continued conscription was reduced and in  ended the armed forces became allvolunteer after years of fighting the paris peace accords were signed at the beginning of  the agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining american troops however it did not require the  north vietnam army regulars located in the south to withdraw once american combat support ended there was a brief truce before fighting broke out again this time without american combat involvement north vietnam conquered south vietnam in  communist governments also took power in laos and cambodia cambodiaedit see also cambodian campaign nixon delivers an address to the nation about the bombings in cambodia april   nixon approved a secret b carpet bombing campaign of north vietnamese positions in cambodia in march  codenamed operation menu without the consent of cambodian leader norodom sihanouk the bombing of cambodia continued into the s in support of the cambodian government of lon nol—which was then battling a khmer rouge insurgency in the cambodian civil war—as part of operation freedom deal it is estimated that between  and  people were killed during the bombing of cambodia between  and  the relationship between the massive carpet bombing of cambodia by the united states and the growth of the khmer rouge in terms of recruitment and popular support has been a matter of interest to historians some historians have cited the us intervention and bombing campaign as a significant factor leading to increased support of the khmer rouge among the cambodian peasantry however pol pot biographer david chandler argues that the bombing had the effect the americans wanted – it broke the communist encirclement of phnom penh chandler states that if you just made a very cold calculating military decision the bombing of  was in fact a sensible thing to do at the time because had it not happened the khmer rouge would have taken phnom penh much earlier and south vietnam would have had a communist country on its flank peter rodman and michael lind claimed that the us intervention saved cambodia from collapse in  and  craig etcheson agreed that it was untenable to assert that us intervention caused the khmer rouge victory while acknowledging that it may have played a small role in boosting recruitment for the insurgents william shawcross however wrote that the khmer rouge were born out of the inferno that american policy did much to create and that sihanouks collaboration with both powers the united states and north vietnam  was intended to save his people by confining the conflict to the border regions it was american policy that engulfed the nation in war latin americaedit nixon and mexican president gustavo díaz ordaz riding a presidential motorcade in san diego california september  cubaedit nixon had been a firm supporter of kennedy in the  bay of pigs invasion and  cuban missile crisis on taking office he stepped up covert operations against cuba and its president fidel castro he maintained close relations with the cubanamerican exile community through his friend bebe rebozo who often suggested ways of irritating castro these activities concerned the soviets and cubans who feared nixon might attack cuba in violation of the understanding between kennedy and khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis in august  the soviets asked nixon to reaffirm the agreement despite his hard line against castro nixon agreed the process—which began in secret but quickly leaked—had not been completed when the us deduced that the soviets were expanding their base at the cuban port of cienfuegos in october  a minor confrontation ensued which was concluded with an understanding that the soviets would not use cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles the final round of diplomatic notes reaffirming the  accord were exchanged in november chileedit main article united states intervention in chile the election of marxist candidate salvador allende as president of chile in september  led nixon to order that allende not be allowed to take office edward korry us ambassador to chile told nixon that he saw no alternative to allende according to the ambassador nixon said that son of a bitch that son a bitchnot you mr ambassador its that son of a bitch allende were going to smash him  nixon pursued a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to allende intended to first prevent allende from taking office called track i and then when that failed to provide a military solution called track ii as part of track ii cia operatives approached senior chilean military leaders using false flag operatives and encouraged a coup détat providing both finances  and weapons submachine guns with us encouragement coup plotters first assassinated army leader general rené schneider as he opposed military interference in the political process once allende took office extensive covert efforts continued with usfunded black propaganda placed in el mercurio strikes organized against allende and funding for allende opponents when el mercurio requested significant funds

climate of economic and political uncertainty henry hecksher cia station chief in santiago warned it would be violent we provide you with formula for chaos which is unlikely to be bloodless  nixon had supported a concerted effort to undermine the chilean economy saying he wanted to make the economy scream with up to  available more if necessary for covert activities the white house effort ordered by nixon and carried out through kissinger and the  committee finally succeeded when general augusto pinochet assumed power in a violent coup détat on september   during the coup the deposed president died under disputed circumstances and there were allegations of american involvement these allegations were proven in  when more than  formerly classified papers from the white house nsc cia fbi us embassy and dia were released as part of the chilean declassification projectxvxx the papers documented extensive evidence of the covert activities engineered by nixon and kissinger designed to overthrow allende the nixon administration later provided covert us support for augusto pinochet despite knowledge of his record of extensive torture internal repression and statesupported international terrorism carried out by dina the chilean secret police through its operation condor program american casualties of nixons policies include charles horman and frank teruggi who were

army soldiers and ronni moffitt who was killed when orlando letelier was assassinated by a car bomb planted by dina in washington dc  soviet unionedit nixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace following the announcement of his visit to china the nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the soviet union the president and first lady arrived in moscow on may   and met with leonid brezhnev the general secretary of the communist party alexei kosygin the chairman of the council of ministers and nikolai podgorny the head of state among other leading soviet officials nixon meets with brezhnev during the soviet leaders trip to the us in  nixon engaged in intense negotiations with brezhnev out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties salt i the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers and the antiballistic missile treaty which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles nixon and brezhnev proclaimed a new era of peaceful coexistence a banquet was held that evening at the kremlin richard nixon in kiev in  seeking to foster better relations with the united states both china and the soviet union cut back on their diplomatic support for north vietnam and advised hanoi to come to terms militarily nixon later described his strategy i had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in vietnam was to enlist if possible the help of the soviets and the chinese though rapprochement with china and détente with the soviet union were ends in themselves i also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war at worst hanoi was bound to feel less confident if washington was dealing with moscow and beijing at best if the two major communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept having made considerable progress over the previous two years in ussoviet relations nixon embarked on a second trip to the soviet union in  he arrived in moscow on june  to a welcome ceremony cheering crowds and a state dinner at the grand kremlin palace that evening nixon and brezhnev met in yalta where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact détente and mirvs while he considered proposing a comprehensive testban treaty nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it there were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations middle eastedit nixon meets with president anwar sadat of egypt june  as part of the nixon doctrine that the us would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible instead giving them assistance to defend themselves the us greatly increased arms sales to the middle east—particularly israel iran and saudi arabia—during the nixon administration the nixon administration strongly supported israel an american ally in the middle east but the support was not unconditional nixon believed that israel should make peace with its arab neighbors and that the united states should encourage it the president believed that—except during the suez crisis—the us had failed to intervene with israel and should use the leverage of the large us military aid to israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table however the arabisraeli conflict was not a major focus of nixons attention during his first term—for one thing he felt that no matter what he did american jews would oppose his reelection when an arab coalition led by egypt and syria attacked in october  beginning the yom kippur war israel suffered initial losses the us took no action for several days until nixon ordered an airlift to israel taking personal responsibility for any response by arab nations nixon cut through interdepartmental squabbles and bureaucracy to initiate an airlift of american arms by the time the us and soviet union negotiated a truce israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory a longterm effect was the movement of egypt away from the soviets toward the us but israels victory came at the cost to the us of the  oil crisis the members of opec decided to raise oil prices in response to the american support of israel after nixon chose to go off the gold standard foreign countries increased their currency reserves in anticipation of currency fluctuation which caused deflation of the dollar and other world currencies since oil was paid for in dollars opec was receiving less value for their product they cut production and announced price hikes as well as an embargo targeted against the united states and the netherlands specifically blaming us support for israel in the yom kippur war for the actions the embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the united states in late  and was eventually ended by the oilproducing nations as peace took hold kissinger played a major role in the settlement and was also able to

of the threshold test ban treaty domestic affairsedit economyedit further information nixon shock and s energy crisis at the time when nixon took office in january  inflation was at  its highest rate since the korean war and rising the great society had been enacted under johnson which together with the vietnam war costs was causing large budget deficits there was little unemployment  but interest rates were at their highest in a century nixons major economic goal was to reduce inflation the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war that however could not be accomplished overnight the administration adopted a policy of restricting the growth of the money supply to address the inflation problem in february  as a part of the effort to keep federal spending down nixon delayed pay raises to federal employees by six months when the nations postal workers went on strike he used the army to keep the postal system going in the end the government met the postal workers wage demands undoing some of the desired budgetbalancing according to political economist nigel bowless  study of nixons economic policies the new president did little to alter johnsons policies through the first year of his presidency the president and congressional republicans entered the  campaign season faced with unemployment inflation and democratic demands for an incomes policy all of which contributed to a lackluster republican performance in the midterm congressional elections republicans gained two seats in the senate but lost nine in the house democrats controlled both houses of congress throughout nixons presidency in  congress had granted the president the power to impose wage and price controls though the democratic congressional leadership knowing nixon had opposed such controls through his career did not expect nixon to actually use the authority with inflation unresolved by august  and an election year looming nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at camp david he then announced temporary wage and price controls allowed the dollar to float against other currencies and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold bowles points out by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflations defeat nixon made it difficult for democratic opponents  to criticize him his opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself nixons policies dampened inflation in  although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the ford administration as nixon began his second term the economy was plagued by a stock market crash and a surge in inflation with the legislation authorizing price controls set to expire on april  the senate democratic caucus recommended a day freeze on all profits interest rates and prices nixon reimposed price controls in june  echoing his  plan as food prices rose this time he focused on agricultural exports and limited the freeze to  days the price controls became unpopular with the public and business people who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy business owners however now saw the controls as permanent rather than temporary and voluntary compliance among small businesses decreased the controls and the accompanying food shortages—as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss—only fueled more inflation despite their failure to rein in inflation controls were slowly ended and on april   their statutory authorization lapsed ultimately inflation would rise to  by the end of the year governmental reorganizationedit nixon advocated a new federalism which would devolve power to state and local elected officials though congress was hostile about these ideas and enacted only a few of them nixon hoped to reduce the number of government departments to eight the existing departments of state justice treasury and defense with the remainder of the executive branch made parts of new departments of economic affairs natural resources human resources and community development although nixon did not succeed in this was able to convince congress to eliminate one cabinetlevel department the united states post office department which in july  as a result of the postal reorganization act was transformed into the united states postal service an independent entity within the executive branch of the federal government postmaster general winton m blount continued to serve through this transition until january   federal regulationsedit environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the  election the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject he saw that the first earth day in april  presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject and sought to use that to his benefit in june he announced the formation of the environmental protection agency epa broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his state of the union speeches other initiatives supported by nixon included the clean air act of  – expanding the federal mandate to control air pollution and protect air quality occupational safety and health act – establishing occupational safety and health administration osha and national institute for occupational safety and health niosh and the national environmental policy act – requiring environmental impact statements for many federal projects other significant regulatory legislation enacted during nixons presidency included the noise control act  marine mammal protection act  consumer product safety act  and the endangered species act  while applauding nixons progressive policy agenda environmentalists found much to criticize in his record the administration strongly supported continued funding of the noisepolluting supersonic transport sst which congress dropped funding for in  additionally he vetoed the clean water act of  and after congress overrode the veto nixon impounded the funds congress had authorized to implement it while not opposed to the goals of the legislation nixon objected to the amount of money to be spent on reaching them which he deemed excessive faced as he was with a generally liberal democratic congress perceived as being spendthrift in  john ehrlichman used the term creditcard congress nixon used this power on multiple occasions during his presidency congresss response came in the form of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of  which established a new budget process and included a procedure providing congressional control over the impoundment of funds by the president nixon mired in watergate signed the legislation july  healthcareedit in august  democratic senator ted kennedy introduced legislation to establish a singlepayer universal health care  financed by taxes and with no cost sharing nixon opposed the proposal in part because it would in his words put all health care under the heavy hand of the federal government the following february he proposed a national health insurance partnership a system combining a mandate requiring employers to buy private health insurance for their employees with an expanded federalized medicaid program for those who could not afford insurance this marketbased system would nixon argued build on the strengths of the private system a third proposal a limited american medical associationbacked medicredit voluntary tax credit plan was also introduced organized labor opposed both plans as did kennedy and the democratic leadership because they maintained a role for private insurers in the system private insurers were indifferent both the house ways and means and senate finance committee held hearings on national health insurance in  but no legislation emerged from either committee as healthcare reform languished the administrations focus shifted to an innovative concept involving health maintenance organizations hmos described by paul m ellwood as organizations groups of physicians and medical insurance providers that would compete on the bases of price and quality and that would combine insurance and health care in a single organization at the outset of the rd congress in january  kennedy introduced legislation providing for a trial federal program to promote and encourage the development of hmos legislation that later in the year became the health maintenance organization act of  there was a renewed push for health insurance reform in  in january representatives martha griffiths and james c corman introduced the health security act a universal national health insurance program providing comprehensive benefits without any cost sharing backed by the aflcio and uaw the following month nixon again proposed the comprehensive health insurance act private health insurance program employer mandatedvoluntary for employees with cost sharing in april kennedy and mills introduced the national health insurance act nearuniversal national health insurance program employer and employee mandated low cost sharing caps and financing by payroll and other taxes organized labor refused to support anything but its own proposal thus killing both the kennedymills plan and presidents union leaders hoped hoped to get a better deal after the  midterm elections that summer after nixons resignation and president fords call for health insurance reform mills tried to advance a compromise based on nixons plan but gave up when the conservative half of his committee instead backed the ama plan medical research initiativesedit nixon submitted two significant medical research initiatives to congress in february  the first popularly referred to as the war on cancer  resulted in passage that december of the national cancer act which injected nearly  billion equivalent to  billion in  in federal funding to cancer research over a threeyear period it also provided for establishment of medical centers dedicated to clinical research and cancer treatment  of them initially whose work is coordinated by the national cancer institute the second initiative focused on sicklecell disease scd resulted in passage of the national sickle cell anemia control act in may  long ignored the lifting of scd from obscurity to high visibility reflected the changing dynamics of electoral politics and race relations in america during the early s under this legislation the national institutes of health established several sickle cell research and treatment centers and the health services administration established sickle cell screening and education clinics around the country us space programedit

from the white house nixon however was unwilling to keep funding for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa at the high level seen through the s as nasa prepared to send men to the moon nasa administrator thomas o paine drew up ambitious plans for the establishment of a permanent base on the moon by the end of the s and the launch of a manned expedition to mars as early as  nixon however rejected both proposals on may   nixon approved a fiveyear cooperative program between nasa and the soviet space program culminating in the apollo–soyuz test project a joint mission of an american apollo and a soviet soyuz spacecraft in  desegregationedit the nixon years witnessed the first largescale efforts to desegregate the nations public schools particularly in the south nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist wallace and liberal democrats whose support of integration was alienating some southern whites soon after beginning his first term nixon appointed vice president agnew to lead a task force which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools agnew had little interest in the work and most of it was done by labor secretary george shultz federal aid was available and a meeting with president nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees by september  less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools by  however tensions over desegregation surfaced in northern cities with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use in addition to desegregating public schools the administration worked to increase the number of racial minorities hired across the nation in various construction trades the first affirmative action program set up the philadelphia plan implemented in  required government contractors in philadelphia to hire minority workers constitutional amendmentsedit when congress extended the voting rights act of  in  it included a provision lowering the age qualification to vote in all elections—federal state and local—to  later that year in oregon v mitchell  the supreme court held that congress had the authority to lower the voting age qualification in federal elections but not the authority to do so in state and local elections nixon sent a letter to congress supporting a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age and congress quickly moved forward with a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing the  yearold vote sent to the states for ratification on march   the proposal became the twentysixth amendment to the united states constitution on july   after being ratified by the requisite number of states  nixon also endorsed the equal rights amendment era which passed both houses of congress in  and was submitted to the state legislatures for ratification the amendment failed to be ratified by  states within the period set by congress for ratification nixon had campaigned as an era supporter in  though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the era or their cause after his election nevertheless he appointed more women to administration positions than lyndon johnson had vietnam war oppositionedit main article opposition to united states involvement in the vietnam war over the course of the vietnam war a large segment of the american population came to be opposed to us involvement in south vietnam public opinion steadily turned against the war following  and by  only a third of americans believed that the us had not made a mistake by sending troops to fight in vietnam during the lates opponents of the war turned to teachins and street protests such as those at the  democratic national convention and the  vietnam moratorium in an effort to turn us political opinion opinions concerning the war grew more polarized after the selective

illegal activities undertaken by members of the nixon administration those activities included dirty tricks such as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom nixon or his officials were suspicious nixon and his close aides ordered harassment of activist groups and political figures using the fbi cia and the irs these activities became known after five men were caught breaking into democratic national committee offices at the watergate complex in washington dc on june   the washington post picked up on the story reporters carl bernstein and bob woodward relying on an informant known as deep throat—later revealed to be mark felt associate director at the fbi—were able to link the men to the nixon administration the white house through presidential press secretary ron ziegler repeatedly dismissed woodward and bernsteins reports and tried to brush the incident aside as a third rate burglary attempt that august nixon categorically denied that any of his white house staff had prior knowledge of the crime and the episode had no impact on his reelection campaign he downplayed the scandal as mere politics calling news articles biased and misleading as a series of revelations later made it clear however nixon aides had committed crimes in attempts to sabotage the democrats and other by early in  senior aides such as white house counsel john dean and chief of staff h r haldeman faced prosecution in may  the senate conducted an investigation of the watergate scandal the investigation known as the watergate hearings was televised and widely watched as the various witnesses gave details not only of the watergate breakin but of various other alleged acts of malfeasance by various administration officials nixons approval rating plummeted on june  dean named nixon as having helped to plan the burglarys coverup and the following month white house aide alexander butterfield testified that nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the oval office these tapes were subpoenaed by watergate independent special prosecutor archibald cox nixon refused to release them citing executive privilege the white house and cox remained at loggerheads until october when nixon had cox fired in what was called the saturday night massacre the firing infuriated congress and engendered public protest on october  the house judiciary committee began consideration of possible impeachment procedures the following day leon jaworski was named as coxs replacement and soon thereafter the president agreed to turn over the requested tapes when the tapes were turned over a few weeks later nixons lawyers revealed that an audio tape of conversations held in the white house on june   featured an ½ minute gap rose mary woods the presidents personal secretary claimed responsibility for the gap alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape though her explanation was widely mocked the gap while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the president cast doubt on nixons statement that he had been unaware of the coverup that same month during an hourlong televised questionandanswer session with the press nixon insisted that he had made mistakes but had no prior knowledge of the burglary did not break any laws and did not learn of the coverup until early  he boldly declared people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook well im not a crook ive earned everything ive got a demonstrator demands nixons impeachment october  through the winter months nixon continued to deflect accusations of wrongdoing and vowed that he would be vindicated meanwhile in the courts and in congress developments continued to propel the unfolding saga toward a climax on march  a grand jury indicted seven former administration officials for conspiring to hinder the investigation of the watergate burglary the grand jury it was disclosed later also named nixon as an unindicted conspirator in april the house judiciary committee voted to subpoena tapes of  presidential conversations and the special prosecutor subpoenaed more tapes and documents as well the white house refused both subpoenas citing executive privilege once more in an unexpected move at the end of april the president announced the release of  pages of transcripts of white house conversations between him and his aides the house judiciary committee opened impeachment hearings against the president on may  these hearings which were televised culminated in votes for articles of impeachment the first being – in favor on july   on obstruction of justice six republicans voted yes along with all  democrats on july  the supreme court ruled unanimously that the full tapes not just selected transcripts must be released nixon oval office meeting with hr haldeman smoking gun conversation june   full transcript even though his base of support had been diminished by the continuing series of revelations nixon hoped to avoid impeachment however one of the newly released tapes the smoking gun tape recorded soon after the breakin demonstrated that nixon had been told of the white house connection to the watergate burglaries soon after they took place and had approved plans to thwart the investigation in a statement accompanying the release of the tapes on august   nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of the truth behind the watergate breakin stating that he had a lapse of memory with their release nixons popular support all but evaporated and his political support collapsed he met with republican congressional leaders two days later and was told he faced certain impeachment in the house and had at most  senators who might vote against his conviction on the articles of impeachment—far fewer than the  he needed to avoid removal from office that night knowing his presidency was effectively over nixon finalized his

necessary to govern effectively and asked the nation to support the new president gerald ford nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency especially in foreign policy and concluded by expressing his personal philosophy about perseverance in public service sometimes i have succeeded and sometimes i have failed but always i have taken heart from what theodore roosevelt once said about the man in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly full text  nixon displays the vforvictory sign as he departs the white house after resigning august   nixons speech contained no admission of wrongdoing and was termed a masterpiece by conrad black one of his biographers black opined that what was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any american president nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue he left while devoting half his address to a recitation of his accomplishments in office the initial response from network commentators was generally favorable with only roger mudd of cbs stating that nixon had evaded the issue and had not admitted his role in the coverup nixon resigned from office on august   early that morning white house chief of staff alexander haig brought nixon a prepared letter of resignation which was addressed to secretary of state henry kissinger as required by the presidential succession act the brief letter read “i hereby resign the office of president of the united states” kissinger would subsequently sign his initials

creation of the epa passage of the endangered species act and the integration of southern public schools happened during his presidency as did the end of military draft and the apollo program which

allies in the cold war with the vietnamization of the vietnam war being the most notable example of his doctrine nixon pursued a detente with the peoples republic of china taking advantage of the sinosoviet split and significantly altering the nature of the cold war nixon also signed the antiballistic missile treaty and salt i two landmark arms control treaties with the soviet union nixons

contest in his home state at the republican national convention in miami beach florida reagan and rockefeller discussed joining forces in a stopnixon movement with each hoping to be nominated in a brokered convention no such movement materialized and nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot he selected maryland governor spiro agnew as his running mate a choice which nixon believed would unite the party appealing to both northern moderates and southerners disaffected with the democrats nixons acceptance speech was a message of hope we extend the hand of friendship to all people to the soviet people to the chinese people to all the people of the world and we work toward the goal of an open world open sky open cities open hearts open minds democrats began  expecting that president johnson who was constitutionally eligible for election to a second full term under the provisions of the nd amendment would again be the partys presidential nominee those expectations were shattered by senator eugene mccarthy who had entered the campaign late in november to give voice to those in the party opposed to johnsons vietnam policies mccarthy narrowly lost to johnson in the first democratic party primary on march  in new hampshire winning  of the vote to johnsons  the results startled the party establishment and spurred senator robert f kennedy of new york to enter the race two weeks later johnson told a stunned the nation that he would not seek a second term in the weeks that followed much of the momentum that had been moving the mccarthy campaign forward shifted toward kennedy this one of the most tumultuous democratic primary election seasons in modern times concluded with kennedy being assassination on june  in los angeles following a rally celebrating his victory

humphrey trailing nixon by more than  percentage points  electoral vote results in addition to nixon and humphrey the race was joined by former democratic alabama governor george wallace a vocal segregationist who ran on the american independent party ticket throughout the campaign nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval he appealed to what he later called the silent majority of socially conservative americans who disliked the hippie counterculture and the antiwar demonstrators agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups solidifying nixons position with the right nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign meeting with supporters in front of cameras he stressed that the crime rate was too high and attacked what he perceived as a surrender by the democrats of the united states nuclear superiority nixon promised peace with honor in the vietnam war and proclaimed that new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the pacific he did not release specifics of how he hoped to end the war resulting in media intimations that he must have a secret plan his slogan of nixons the one proved to

chinese premier zhou enlai upon arriving in beijing even those who opposed nixon occasionally praise his work in china the extent to which his visit had any profound consequences of note however remain very much open to debate nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to china prior to becoming president writing the before his election that there is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation assisting him in this venture was his national security advisor and future secretary of state henry kissinger with whom the president worked closely bypassing cabinet officials with relations between the soviet union and china at a nadir—border clashes between the two took place during nixons first year in office—nixon sent private word to the chinese through pakistan a country friendly to both china and united states that he desired closer relations with the chinese a breakthrough came in early  when chairman mao invited a team of american table tennis players to visit china and play against top chinese players nixon followed up by sending kissinger to china for clandestine meetings with chinese officials on july   it was simultaneously announced by beijing and by nixon on television and radio that the president would visit china the following february the announcements astounded the world the secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact in february  president and mrs nixon traveled to china kissinger briefed nixon for over  hours in preparation upon touching down the president and first lady emerged from air force one and greeted chinese premier zhou enlai nixon made a point of shaking zhous hand something which thensecretary of state john foster dulles had refused to do in  when the two met in geneva over  television journalists accompanied the president on nixons orders television was strongly favored over printed publications as nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print it also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised nixon and kissinger met for an hour with mao and zhou at maos official private residence where they discussed a range of issues mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by nixon whom he considered forthright unlike the leftists and the soviets he also said he was suspicious of kissinger though the national security advisor referred to their meeting as his encounter with history a formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the great hall of the people the following day nixon met with zhou during this meeting he stated that he believed “there is one china and taiwan is a part of china” when not in meetings nixon toured architectural wonders including the forbidden city ming tombs and the great wall americans received their first glimpse into chinese life through the cameras which accompanied pat nixon who toured the city of beijing and visited communes schools factories and hospitals the visit ushered in a new era of sinoamerican relations fearing the possibility of a sinoamerican alliance the soviet union yielded to pressure for détente with the united states vietnamedit main articles vietnam war operation menu and role of the united states in the vietnam war at the time nixon took office about  american soldiers were dying each week in vietnam and the war was broadly unpopular in the united states with widespread sometimes violent protests against the war taking place on a regular basis including a protest at nixons inauguration the johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions but this agreement never fully took force according to walter isaacson soon after taking office nixon had concluded that the vietnam war could not be won and he was determined to end the war quickly conversely black argues that nixon sincerely believed he could intimidate north vietnam through the madman theory nixon sought some arrangement which would permit american forces to withdraw while leaving south vietnam secure against attack in mid nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the north vietnamese sending a personal letter to north vietnamese leaders and peace talks began in paris initial talks however did not result in an agreement in july  nixon visited south vietnam where he met with his us military commanders and president nguyen van thieu amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout he implemented a strategy of replacing american troops with vietnamese troops known as vietnamization he soon instituted phased us troop withdrawals but authorized incursions into laos in part to interrupt the ho chi minh trail used to supply north vietnamese forces that passed through laos and cambodia nixon announced the ground invasion of cambodia to the american public on april   his responses to protesters included an impromptu early morning meeting with them at the lincoln memorial on may   documents uncovered from the soviet archives after  reveal that the north vietnamese attempt to overrun cambodia in  was launched at the explicit request of the khmer rouge and negotiated by pol pots then second in command nuon chea nixons campaign promise to curb the war contrasted with the escalated bombing led to claims that nixon had a credibility gap on the issue in  excerpts from the pentagon papers which had been leaked by daniel ellsberg were published by the new york times and the washington post when news of the leak first appeared nixon was inclined to do nothing the papers a history of united states involvement in vietnam mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations he was persuaded by kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared and the president tried to prevent publication the supreme court eventually ruled for the newspapers as us troop withdrawals continued conscription was reduced and in  ended the armed forces became allvolunteer after years of fighting the paris peace accords were signed at the beginning of  the agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining american troops however it did not require the  north vietnam army regulars located in the south to withdraw once american combat support ended there was a brief truce before fighting broke out again this time without american combat involvement north vietnam conquered south vietnam in

recruitment and popular support has been a matter of interest to historians some historians have cited the us intervention and bombing campaign as a significant factor leading to increased support of the khmer rouge among the cambodian peasantry however pol pot biographer david chandler argues that the bombing had the effect the americans wanted – it broke the communist encirclement of phnom penh chandler states that if you just made a very cold calculating military decision the bombing of  was in fact a sensible thing to do at the time because had it not happened the khmer rouge would have taken phnom penh much earlier and south vietnam would have had a communist country on its flank peter rodman and michael lind claimed that the us intervention saved cambodia from collapse in  and  craig etcheson agreed that it was untenable to assert that us intervention caused the khmer rouge victory while acknowledging that it may have played a small role in boosting recruitment for the insurgents william shawcross however wrote that the khmer rouge were born out of the inferno that american policy did much to create and that sihanouks collaboration with both powers the united states

taking office he stepped up covert operations against cuba and its president fidel castro he maintained close relations with the cubanamerican exile community through his friend bebe rebozo who often suggested ways of irritating castro these activities concerned the soviets and cubans who feared nixon might attack cuba in violation of the understanding between kennedy and khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis in august  the soviets asked nixon to reaffirm the agreement despite his hard line against castro nixon agreed the process—which began in secret but quickly leaked—had not been completed when the us deduced that the soviets were expanding their base at the cuban port of cienfuegos in october  a minor confrontation ensued which was concluded with an understanding that the soviets would not use cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles the final round of diplomatic notes reaffirming the  accord were exchanged in november chileedit main article united

state among other leading soviet officials nixon meets with brezhnev during the soviet leaders trip to the us in  nixon engaged in intense negotiations with brezhnev out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties salt i the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers and the antiballistic missile treaty which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles nixon and brezhnev proclaimed a new era of peaceful coexistence a banquet was held that evening at the kremlin richard nixon in kiev in  seeking to foster better relations with the united states both china and the soviet union cut back on their diplomatic support for north vietnam and advised hanoi to come to terms militarily nixon later described his strategy i had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in vietnam was to enlist if possible the help of the soviets and the chinese though rapprochement with china and détente with the soviet union were ends in themselves i also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war at worst hanoi was bound to feel less confident if washington was dealing with moscow and beijing at best if the two major communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept having made considerable progress over the previous two years in ussoviet relations nixon embarked on a second trip to the soviet union in  he arrived in moscow on june  to a welcome ceremony cheering

anwar sadat of egypt june  as part of the nixon doctrine that the us would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible instead giving them assistance to defend themselves the us greatly increased arms sales to the middle east—particularly israel iran and saudi arabia—during the nixon administration the nixon administration strongly supported israel an american ally in the middle east but the support was not unconditional nixon believed that israel should make peace with its arab neighbors and that the united states should encourage it the president believed that—except during the suez crisis—the us had failed to intervene with israel and should use the leverage of the large us military aid to israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table however the arabisraeli conflict was not a major focus of nixons attention during his first term—for one thing he felt that no matter what he did american jews would oppose his reelection when an arab coalition led by egypt and syria attacked in october  beginning the yom kippur war israel suffered initial losses the us took no action for several days until nixon ordered an airlift to israel taking personal responsibility for any response by arab nations nixon cut through interdepartmental squabbles and bureaucracy to initiate an airlift of american arms by the time the us and soviet union negotiated a truce israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory a longterm effect was the movement of egypt away from the soviets toward the us but israels victory came at the cost to the us of the  oil crisis the members of opec decided to raise oil prices in response to the american support of israel after nixon chose to go off the gold standard foreign countries increased their currency reserves in anticipation of currency fluctuation which caused deflation of the dollar and other world currencies since oil was paid for in dollars opec was receiving less value for their product they cut production and announced price hikes as well as an embargo targeted against the united states and the netherlands specifically blaming us support for israel in the yom kippur war for the actions the embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the united states in late  and was eventually ended by the oilproducing nations as peace took hold kissinger played a major role in the settlement and was also able to

since the korean war and rising the great society had been enacted under johnson which together with the vietnam war costs was causing large budget deficits there was little unemployment  but interest rates were at their highest in a century nixons major economic goal was to reduce inflation the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war that however could not be accomplished overnight the administration adopted a policy of restricting the growth of the money supply to address the inflation problem in february  as a part of the effort to keep federal spending down nixon delayed pay raises to federal employees by six months when the nations postal workers went on strike he used the army to keep the postal system going in the end the government met the postal workers wage demands undoing some of the desired budgetbalancing according to political economist nigel bowless  study of nixons economic policies the new president did little to alter johnsons policies through the first year of his presidency the president and congressional republicans entered the  campaign season faced with unemployment inflation and democratic demands for an incomes policy all of which contributed to a lackluster republican performance in the midterm congressional elections republicans gained two seats in the senate but lost nine in the house democrats controlled both houses of congress throughout nixons presidency in  congress had granted the president the power to impose wage and price controls though the democratic congressional leadership knowing nixon had opposed such controls through his career did not expect nixon to actually use the authority with inflation unresolved by august  and an election year looming nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at camp david he then announced temporary wage and price controls allowed the dollar to float against other currencies and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold bowles points out by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflations defeat nixon made it difficult for democratic opponents  to criticize him his opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself nixons policies dampened inflation in  although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the ford administration as nixon began his second term the economy was plagued by a stock market crash and a surge in inflation with the legislation authorizing price controls set to expire on april  the senate democratic caucus recommended a day freeze on all profits interest rates and prices nixon reimposed price controls in june  echoing his  plan as food prices rose this time he focused on agricultural exports and limited the freeze to  days the price controls became unpopular with the public and business people who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy business owners however now saw the controls as permanent rather than temporary and voluntary compliance among small businesses decreased the controls and the accompanying food shortages—as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss—only fueled more inflation despite their failure to rein in inflation controls were slowly ended and on april   their statutory authorization lapsed ultimately inflation would rise to  by the end of the year governmental reorganizationedit nixon advocated a new federalism which would devolve power to state and local elected officials though congress was hostile about these ideas and enacted only a few of them nixon hoped to reduce the number of government departments to eight the existing departments of state justice treasury and defense with the remainder of the executive branch made parts of new departments of economic affairs natural resources human resources and community development although nixon did not succeed in this was able to convince congress to eliminate one cabinetlevel department the united states post office department which in july  as a result of the postal reorganization act was transformed into the united states postal service an independent entity within the executive branch of the federal government postmaster general winton m blount continued to serve through this transition until january   federal regulationsedit environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the  election the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject he saw that the first earth day in april  presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject and sought to use that to his benefit in june he announced the formation of the environmental protection agency epa broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his state of the union speeches other initiatives supported by nixon included the clean air act of  – expanding the federal mandate to control air pollution and protect air quality occupational safety and health act – establishing occupational safety and health administration osha and national institute for occupational safety and health niosh and the national environmental policy act – requiring environmental impact statements for many federal projects other significant regulatory legislation enacted during nixons presidency included the noise control act  marine mammal protection act  consumer product safety act  and the endangered species act  while applauding nixons progressive policy agenda environmentalists found much to criticize in his record the administration strongly supported continued funding of the noisepolluting supersonic transport sst which congress dropped funding for in  additionally he vetoed the clean water act of  and after congress overrode the veto nixon impounded the funds congress had authorized to implement it while not opposed to the goals of the legislation nixon objected to the amount of money to be spent on reaching them which he deemed excessive faced as he was with a generally liberal democratic congress perceived as being spendthrift in  john ehrlichman used the term creditcard congress nixon used this power on multiple occasions during his presidency congresss response came in the form of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of  which established a new budget process and included a procedure providing congressional control over the impoundment of funds by the president nixon mired in watergate signed the legislation july  healthcareedit in august  democratic senator ted kennedy introduced legislation to establish a singlepayer universal health care  financed by taxes and with no cost sharing nixon opposed the proposal in part because it would in his words put all health care under the heavy hand of the federal government the following february he proposed a national health insurance partnership a system combining a mandate requiring employers to buy private health insurance for their employees with an expanded federalized medicaid program for those who could not afford insurance this marketbased system would nixon argued build on the strengths of the private system a third proposal a limited american medical associationbacked medicredit voluntary tax credit plan was also introduced organized labor opposed both plans as did kennedy and the democratic leadership because they maintained a role for private insurers in the system private insurers were indifferent both the house ways and means and senate finance committee held hearings on national health insurance in  but no legislation emerged from either committee as healthcare reform languished the administrations focus shifted to an innovative concept involving health maintenance organizations hmos described by paul m ellwood as organizations groups of physicians and medical insurance providers that would compete on the bases of price and quality and that would combine insurance and health care in a single organization at the outset of the rd congress in january  kennedy introduced legislation providing for a trial federal program to promote and encourage the development of hmos legislation that later in the year became the health maintenance organization act of  there was a renewed push for health insurance reform in  in january representatives martha griffiths and james c corman introduced the health security act a universal national health insurance program providing comprehensive benefits without any cost sharing backed by the aflcio and uaw the following month nixon again proposed the comprehensive health insurance act private health insurance program employer mandatedvoluntary for employees with cost sharing in april kennedy and mills introduced the national health insurance act nearuniversal national health insurance program employer and employee mandated low cost sharing caps and financing by payroll and other taxes organized labor refused to support anything but its own proposal thus killing both the kennedymills plan and presidents union leaders hoped hoped to get a better deal after the  midterm elections that summer after nixons resignation and president fords call for health insurance reform mills tried to advance a compromise based on nixons plan but gave up when the conservative half of his committee instead backed the ama plan medical research initiativesedit nixon submitted two significant medical research initiatives to congress in february  the first popularly referred to as the war on cancer  resulted in passage that december of the national cancer act which injected nearly  billion equivalent to  billion in  in federal funding to cancer research over a threeyear period it also provided for establishment of medical centers dedicated to clinical research and cancer treatment  of them initially whose work is coordinated by the national cancer institute the second initiative focused on sicklecell disease scd resulted in passage of the national sickle cell anemia control act in may  long ignored the lifting of scd from obscurity to high visibility reflected the changing dynamics of electoral politics and race relations in america during the early s under this legislation the national institutes of health

an american apollo and a soviet soyuz spacecraft in  desegregationedit the nixon years witnessed the first largescale efforts to desegregate the nations public schools particularly in the south nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist wallace and liberal democrats whose support of integration was alienating some southern whites soon after beginning his first term nixon appointed vice president agnew to lead a task force which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools agnew had little interest in the work and most of it was done by labor secretary george shultz federal aid was available and a meeting with president nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees by september  less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools by  however tensions over desegregation surfaced in northern cities with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use in addition to desegregating public schools the administration worked to increase the number of racial minorities

local—to  later that year in oregon v mitchell  the supreme court held that congress had the authority to lower the voting age qualification in federal elections but not the authority to do so in state and local elections nixon sent a letter to congress supporting a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age and congress quickly moved forward with a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing the  yearold vote sent to the states for ratification on march   the proposal became the twentysixth amendment to the united states constitution on july   after being ratified by the requisite number of states  nixon also endorsed the equal rights amendment era which passed both houses of congress in  and was submitted to the state legislatures for ratification the amendment failed to be ratified by  states within the period set by congress for ratification nixon had campaigned as an era supporter in  though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the era or

were suspicious nixon and his close aides ordered harassment of activist groups and political figures using the fbi cia and the irs these activities became known after five men were caught breaking into democratic national committee offices at the watergate complex in washington dc on june   the washington post picked up on the story reporters carl bernstein and bob woodward relying on an informant known as deep throat—later revealed to be mark felt associate director at the fbi—were able to link the men to the nixon administration the white house through presidential press secretary ron ziegler repeatedly dismissed woodward and bernsteins reports and tried to brush the incident aside as a third rate burglary attempt that august nixon categorically denied that any of his white house staff had prior knowledge of the crime and the episode had no impact on his reelection campaign he downplayed the scandal as mere politics calling news articles biased and misleading as a series

evaporated and his political support collapsed he met with republican congressional leaders two days later and was told he faced certain impeachment in the house and had at most  senators who might

contest in his home state at the republican national convention in miami beach florida reagan and rockefeller discussed joining forces in a stopnixon movement with each hoping to be nominated in a brokered convention no such movement materialized and nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot he selected maryland governor spiro agnew as his running mate a choice which nixon believed would unite the party appealing to both northern moderates and southerners disaffected with the democrats nixons acceptance speech was a message of hope we extend the hand of friendship to all people to the soviet people to the chinese people to all the people of the world and we work toward the goal of an open world open sky open cities open hearts open minds democrats began  expecting that president johnson who was constitutionally eligible for election to a second full term under the provisions of the nd amendment would again be the partys presidential nominee those expectations were shattered by senator eugene mccarthy who had entered the campaign late in november to give voice to those in the party opposed to johnsons vietnam policies mccarthy narrowly lost to johnson in the first democratic party primary on march  in new hampshire winning  of the vote to johnsons  the results startled the party establishment and spurred senator robert f kennedy of new york to enter the race two weeks later johnson told a stunned the nation that he would not seek a second term in the weeks that followed much of the momentum that had been moving the mccarthy campaign forward shifted toward kennedy this one of the most tumultuous democratic primary election seasons in modern times concluded with kennedy being assassination on june  in los angeles following a rally celebrating his victory

state john foster dulles had refused to do in  when the two met in geneva over  television journalists accompanied the president on nixons orders television was strongly favored over printed publications as nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print it also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised nixon and kissinger met for an hour with mao and zhou at maos official private residence where they discussed a range of issues mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by nixon whom he considered forthright unlike the leftists and the soviets he also said he was suspicious of kissinger though the national security advisor referred to their meeting as his encounter with history a formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the great hall of the people the following day nixon met with zhou during this meeting he stated that he believed “there is one china and taiwan is a part of china” when not in meetings nixon toured architectural wonders including the forbidden city ming tombs and the great wall americans received their first glimpse into chinese life through the

at the time nixon took office about  american soldiers were dying each week in vietnam and the war was broadly unpopular in the united states with widespread sometimes violent protests against the war taking place on a regular basis including a protest at nixons inauguration the johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions but this agreement never fully took force according to walter isaacson soon after taking office nixon had concluded that the vietnam war could not be won and he was determined to end the war quickly conversely black argues that nixon sincerely believed he could intimidate north vietnam through the madman theory nixon sought some arrangement which would permit american forces to withdraw while leaving south vietnam secure against attack in mid nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the north vietnamese sending a personal letter to north vietnamese leaders and peace talks began in paris initial talks however did not result in an agreement in july  nixon visited south vietnam where he met with his us military commanders and president nguyen van thieu amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout he implemented a strategy of replacing american troops with vietnamese troops known as vietnamization he soon instituted phased us troop withdrawals but authorized incursions into laos in part to interrupt the ho chi minh trail used to supply north vietnamese forces that passed through laos and cambodia nixon announced the ground invasion of cambodia to the american public on april   his responses to protesters included an impromptu early morning meeting with them at the lincoln memorial on may   documents uncovered from the soviet archives after  reveal that the north vietnamese attempt to overrun cambodia in  was launched at the explicit request of the khmer rouge and negotiated by pol pots then second in command nuon chea nixons campaign promise to curb the war contrasted with the escalated bombing led to claims that nixon had a credibility gap on the issue in  excerpts from the pentagon papers which had been leaked by daniel ellsberg were published by the new york times and the washington post when news of the leak first appeared nixon was inclined to do nothing the papers a history of united states involvement in vietnam mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations he was persuaded by kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared and the president tried to prevent publication the supreme court eventually ruled for the newspapers as us troop withdrawals continued conscription was reduced and in  ended the armed forces became allvolunteer after years of fighting the paris peace accords were signed at the beginning of  the agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining american troops however it did not require the  north vietnam army regulars located in the south to withdraw once american combat support ended there was a brief truce before fighting broke out again this time without american combat involvement north vietnam conquered south vietnam in

recruitment and popular support has been a matter of interest to historians some historians have cited the us intervention and bombing campaign as a significant factor leading to increased support of the khmer rouge among the cambodian peasantry however pol pot biographer david chandler argues that the bombing had the effect the americans wanted – it broke the communist encirclement of phnom penh chandler states that if you just made a very cold calculating military decision the bombing of  was in fact a sensible thing to do at the time because had it not happened the khmer rouge would have taken phnom penh much earlier and south vietnam would have had a communist country on its flank peter rodman and michael lind claimed that the us intervention saved cambodia from collapse in  and  craig etcheson agreed that it was untenable to assert that us intervention caused the khmer rouge victory while acknowledging that it may have played a small role in boosting recruitment for the insurgents william shawcross however wrote that the khmer rouge were born out of the inferno that american policy did much to create and that sihanouks collaboration with both powers the united states and north vietnam  was intended to save his people by confining the conflict to the border regions it was american policy that engulfed the nation in war latin americaedit nixon and mexican president

taking office he stepped up covert operations against cuba and its president fidel castro he maintained close relations with the cubanamerican exile community through his friend bebe rebozo who often suggested ways of irritating castro these activities concerned the soviets and cubans who feared nixon might attack cuba in violation of the understanding between kennedy and khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis in august  the soviets asked nixon to reaffirm the agreement despite his hard line against castro nixon agreed the process—which began in secret but quickly leaked—had not been completed when the us deduced that the soviets were expanding their base at the cuban port of cienfuegos in october  a minor confrontation ensued which was concluded with an understanding that the soviets would not use cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles the final round of diplomatic notes reaffirming the  accord were exchanged in november chileedit main article united

state among other leading soviet officials nixon meets with brezhnev during the soviet leaders trip to the us in  nixon engaged in intense negotiations with brezhnev out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties salt i the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers and the antiballistic missile treaty which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles nixon and brezhnev proclaimed a new era of peaceful coexistence a banquet was held that evening at the kremlin richard nixon in kiev in  seeking to foster better relations with the united states both china and the soviet union cut back on their diplomatic support for north vietnam and advised hanoi to come to terms militarily nixon later described his strategy i had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in vietnam was to enlist if possible the help of the soviets and the chinese though rapprochement with china and détente with the soviet union were ends in themselves i also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war at worst hanoi was bound to feel less confident if washington was dealing with moscow and beijing at best if the two major communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept having made considerable progress over the previous two years in ussoviet relations nixon embarked on a second trip to the soviet union in  he arrived in moscow on june  to a welcome ceremony cheering

anwar sadat of egypt june  as part of the nixon doctrine that the us would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible instead giving them assistance to defend themselves the us greatly increased arms sales to the middle east—particularly israel iran and saudi arabia—during the nixon administration the nixon administration strongly supported israel an american ally in the middle east but the support was not unconditional nixon believed that israel should make peace with its arab neighbors and that the united states should encourage it the president believed that—except during the suez crisis—the us had failed to intervene with israel and should use the leverage of the large us military aid to israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table however the arabisraeli conflict was not a major focus of nixons attention during his first term—for one thing he felt that no matter what he did american jews would oppose his reelection when an arab coalition led by egypt and syria attacked in october  beginning the yom kippur war israel suffered initial losses the us took no action for several days until nixon ordered an airlift to israel taking personal responsibility for any response by arab nations nixon cut through interdepartmental squabbles and bureaucracy to initiate an airlift of american arms by the time the us and soviet union negotiated a truce israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory a longterm effect was the movement of egypt away from the soviets toward the us but israels victory came at the cost to the us of the  oil crisis the members of opec decided to raise oil prices in response to the american support of israel after nixon chose to go off the gold standard foreign countries increased their currency reserves in anticipation of currency fluctuation which caused deflation of the dollar and other world currencies since oil was paid for in dollars opec was receiving less value for their product they cut production and announced price hikes as well as an embargo targeted against the united states and the netherlands specifically blaming us support for israel in the yom kippur war for the actions the embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the united states in late  and was eventually ended by the oilproducing nations as peace took hold kissinger played a major role in the settlement and was also able to

since the korean war and rising the great society had been enacted under johnson which together with the vietnam war costs was causing large budget deficits there was little unemployment  but interest rates were at their highest in a century nixons major economic goal was to reduce inflation the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war that however could not be accomplished overnight the administration adopted a policy of restricting the growth of the money supply to address the inflation problem in february  as a part of the effort to keep federal spending down nixon delayed pay raises to federal employees by six months when the nations postal workers went on strike he used the army to keep the postal system going in the end the government met the postal workers wage demands undoing some of the desired budgetbalancing according to political economist nigel bowless  study of nixons economic policies the new president did little to alter johnsons policies through the first year of his presidency the president and congressional republicans entered the  campaign season faced with unemployment inflation and democratic demands for an incomes policy all of which contributed to a lackluster republican performance in the midterm congressional elections republicans gained two seats in the senate but lost nine in the house democrats controlled both houses of congress throughout nixons presidency in  congress had granted the president the power to impose wage and price controls though the democratic congressional leadership knowing nixon had opposed such controls through his career did not expect nixon to actually use the authority with inflation unresolved by august  and an election year looming nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at camp david he then announced temporary wage and price controls allowed the dollar to float against other currencies and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold bowles points out by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflations defeat nixon made it difficult for democratic opponents  to criticize him his opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself nixons policies dampened inflation in  although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the ford administration as nixon began his second term the economy was plagued by a stock market crash and a surge in inflation with the legislation authorizing price controls set to expire on april  the senate democratic caucus recommended a day freeze on all profits interest rates and prices nixon reimposed price controls in june  echoing his  plan as food prices rose this time he focused on agricultural exports and limited the freeze to  days the price controls became unpopular with the public and business people who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy business owners however now saw the controls as permanent rather than temporary and voluntary compliance among small businesses decreased the controls and the accompanying food shortages—as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss—only fueled more inflation despite their failure to rein in inflation controls were slowly ended and on april   their statutory authorization lapsed ultimately inflation would rise to  by the end of the year governmental reorganizationedit nixon advocated a new federalism which would devolve power to state and local elected officials though congress was hostile about these ideas and enacted only a few of them nixon hoped to reduce the number of government departments to eight the existing departments of state justice treasury and defense with the remainder of the executive branch made parts of new departments of economic affairs natural resources human resources and community development although nixon did not succeed in this was able to convince congress to eliminate one cabinetlevel department the united states post office department which in july  as a result of the postal reorganization act was transformed into the united states postal service an independent entity within the executive branch of the federal government postmaster general winton m blount continued to serve through this transition until january   federal regulationsedit environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the  election the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject he saw that the first earth day in april  presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject and sought to use that to his benefit in june he announced the formation of the environmental protection agency epa broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his state of the union speeches other initiatives supported by nixon included the clean air act of  – expanding the federal mandate to control air pollution and protect air quality occupational safety and health act – establishing occupational safety and health administration osha and national institute for occupational safety and health niosh and the national environmental policy act – requiring environmental impact statements for many federal projects other significant regulatory legislation enacted during nixons presidency included the noise control act  marine mammal protection act  consumer product safety act  and the endangered species act  while applauding nixons progressive policy agenda environmentalists found much to criticize in his record the administration strongly supported continued funding of the noisepolluting supersonic transport sst which congress dropped funding for in  additionally he vetoed the clean water act of  and after congress overrode the veto nixon impounded the funds congress had authorized to implement it while not opposed to the goals of the legislation nixon objected to the amount of money to be spent on reaching them which he deemed excessive faced as he was with a generally liberal democratic congress perceived as being spendthrift in  john ehrlichman used the term creditcard congress nixon used this power on multiple occasions during his presidency congresss response came in the form of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of  which established a new budget process and included a procedure providing congressional control over the impoundment of funds by the president nixon mired in watergate signed the legislation july  healthcareedit in august  democratic senator ted kennedy introduced legislation to establish a singlepayer universal health care  financed by taxes and with no cost sharing nixon opposed the proposal in part because it would in his words put all health care under the heavy hand of the federal government the following february he proposed a national health insurance partnership a system combining a mandate requiring employers to buy private health insurance for their employees with an expanded federalized medicaid program for those who could not afford insurance this marketbased system would nixon argued build on the strengths of the private system a third proposal a limited american medical associationbacked medicredit voluntary tax credit plan was also introduced organized labor opposed both plans as did kennedy and the democratic leadership because they maintained a role for private insurers in the system private insurers were indifferent both the house ways and means and senate finance committee held hearings on national health insurance in  but no legislation emerged from either committee as healthcare reform languished the administrations focus shifted to an innovative concept involving health maintenance organizations hmos described by paul m ellwood as organizations groups of physicians and medical insurance providers that would compete on the bases of price and quality and that would combine insurance and health care in a single organization at the outset of the rd congress in january  kennedy introduced legislation providing for a trial federal program to promote and encourage the development of hmos legislation that later in the year became the health maintenance organization act of  there was a renewed push for health insurance reform in  in january representatives martha griffiths and james c corman introduced the health security act a universal national health insurance program providing comprehensive benefits without any cost sharing backed by the aflcio and uaw the following month nixon again proposed the comprehensive health insurance act private health insurance program employer mandatedvoluntary for employees with cost sharing in april kennedy and mills introduced the national health insurance act nearuniversal national health insurance program employer and employee mandated low cost sharing caps and financing by payroll and other taxes organized labor refused to support anything but its own proposal thus killing both the kennedymills plan and presidents union leaders hoped hoped to get a better deal after the  midterm elections that summer after nixons resignation and president fords call for health insurance reform mills tried to advance a compromise based on nixons plan but gave up when the conservative half of his committee instead backed the ama plan medical research initiativesedit nixon submitted two significant medical research initiatives to congress in february  the first popularly referred to as the war on cancer  resulted in passage that december of the national cancer act which injected nearly  billion equivalent to  billion in  in federal funding to cancer research over a threeyear period it also provided for establishment of medical centers dedicated to clinical research and cancer treatment  of them initially whose work is coordinated by the national cancer institute the second initiative focused on sicklecell disease scd resulted in passage of the national sickle cell anemia control act in may  long ignored the lifting of scd from obscurity to high visibility reflected the changing dynamics of electoral politics and race relations in america during the early s under this legislation the national institutes of health

an american apollo and a soviet soyuz spacecraft in  desegregationedit the nixon years witnessed the first largescale efforts to desegregate the nations public schools particularly in the south nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist wallace and liberal democrats whose support of integration was alienating some southern whites soon after beginning his first term nixon appointed vice president agnew to lead a task force which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools agnew had little interest in the work and most of it was done by labor secretary george shultz federal aid was available and a meeting with president nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees by september  less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools by  however tensions over desegregation surfaced in northern cities with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use in addition to desegregating public schools the administration worked to increase the number of racial minorities hired across the nation in various construction trades the first affirmative action program set up the philadelphia plan implemented in  required government contractors in philadelphia to hire minority workers constitutional amendmentsedit when congress extended the voting rights act of  in  it included a provision lowering the age qualification to vote in all elections—federal state and local—to  later that year in oregon v mitchell  the supreme court held that congress had the authority to lower the voting age qualification in federal elections but not the authority to do so in state and local elections nixon sent a letter to congress supporting a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age and congress quickly moved forward with a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing the  yearold vote sent to the states for ratification on march   the proposal became the twentysixth amendment to the united states constitution on july   after being ratified by the requisite number of states  nixon also endorsed the equal rights amendment era which passed both houses of congress in  and was submitted to the state legislatures for ratification the amendment failed to be ratified by  states within the period set by congress for ratification nixon had campaigned as an era supporter in  though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the era or their cause after his election nevertheless he appointed more women to administration positions than lyndon johnson had vietnam war oppositionedit main article opposition to united states involvement

were suspicious nixon and his close aides ordered harassment of activist groups and political figures using the fbi cia and the irs these activities became known after five men were caught breaking into democratic national committee offices at the watergate complex in washington dc on june   the washington post picked up on the story reporters carl bernstein and bob woodward relying on an informant known as deep throat—later revealed to be mark felt associate director at the fbi—were able to link the men to the nixon administration the white house through presidential press secretary ron ziegler repeatedly dismissed woodward and bernsteins reports and tried to brush the incident aside as a third rate burglary attempt that august nixon categorically denied that any of his white house staff had prior knowledge of the crime and the episode had no impact on his reelection campaign he downplayed the scandal as mere politics calling news articles biased and misleading as a series

evaporated and his political support collapsed he met with republican congressional leaders two days later and was told he faced certain impeachment in the house and had at most  senators who might

necessary to govern effectively and asked the nation to support the new president gerald ford nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency especially in foreign policy and concluded by expressing his personal philosophy about perseverance in public service sometimes i have succeeded and sometimes i have failed but always i have taken heart from what theodore roosevelt once said about the man in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly full text  nixon displays the vforvictory sign as he departs the white house after resigning august   nixons speech contained no admission of wrongdoing and was termed a masterpiece by conrad black one of his biographers black opined that what was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any american president nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue he left while devoting half his address to a recitation of his accomplishments in office the initial response from network commentators was generally favorable with only roger mudd of cbs stating that nixon had evaded the issue and had not admitted his role in the coverup nixon resigned from office on august   early that morning white house chief of staff alexander haig brought nixon a prepared letter of resignation which was addressed to secretary of state

creation of the epa passage of the endangered species act and the integration of southern public schools happened during his presidency as did the end of military draft and the apollo program which successfully landed americans on the moon nixons primary focus while in office was on foreign affairs his foreign policy agenda known as the nixon doctrine called for indirect assistance to american allies in the cold war with the vietnamization of the vietnam war being the most notable example of his doctrine nixon pursued a detente with the peoples republic of china taking advantage of the sinosoviet split and significantly altering the nature of the cold war nixon also signed the antiballistic missile treaty and salt i two landmark arms control treaties with the soviet union nixons domestic and foreign policy accomplishments as president were however largely overshadowed by the scandals that enveloped his administration nixon was forced to resign from office after congress began

he expected the election to be as close as in  nixon won a resounding victory in the first republican party primary on march  in new hampshire winning  of the vote antiwar republicans wrote in the name of new york governor nelson rockefeller the leader of the gops liberal wing who received  of the vote he later defeated nixon in the massachusetts primary on april  but otherwise fared poorly in the state primaries and conventions that spring california governor ronald reagan emerged as the leading voice of republican conservatism attaining second place in two primaries and winning the contest in his home state at the republican national convention in miami beach florida reagan and rockefeller discussed joining forces in a stopnixon movement with each hoping to be nominated in a brokered convention no such movement materialized and nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot he selected maryland governor spiro agnew as his running mate a choice which nixon believed would unite the party appealing to both northern moderates and southerners disaffected with the democrats nixons acceptance speech was a message of hope we extend the hand of friendship to all people to the soviet people to the chinese people to all the people of the world and we work toward the goal of an open world open sky open cities open hearts open minds democrats began  expecting that president johnson who was constitutionally eligible for election to a second full term under the provisions of the nd amendment would again be the partys presidential nominee those expectations were shattered by senator eugene mccarthy who had entered the campaign late in november to give voice to those in the party opposed to johnsons vietnam policies mccarthy narrowly lost to johnson in the first democratic party primary on march  in new hampshire winning  of the vote to johnsons  the results startled the party establishment and spurred senator robert f kennedy of new york to enter the race two weeks later johnson told a stunned the nation that he would not seek a second term in the weeks that followed much of the momentum that had been moving the mccarthy campaign forward shifted toward kennedy this one of the most tumultuous democratic primary election seasons in modern times concluded with kennedy being assassination on june  in los angeles following a rally celebrating his victory

segregationist who ran on the american independent party ticket throughout the campaign nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval he appealed to what he later called the silent majority of socially conservative americans who disliked the hippie counterculture and the antiwar demonstrators agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these

remain very much open to debate nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to china prior to becoming president writing the before his election that there is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation assisting him in this venture was his national security advisor and future secretary of state henry kissinger with whom the president worked closely bypassing cabinet officials with relations between the soviet union and china at a nadir—border clashes between the two took place during nixons first year in office—nixon sent private word to the chinese through pakistan a country friendly to both china and united states that he desired closer relations with the chinese a breakthrough came in early  when chairman mao invited a team of american table tennis players to visit china and play against top chinese players nixon followed up by sending kissinger to china for clandestine meetings with chinese officials on july   it was simultaneously announced by beijing and by nixon on television and radio that the president would visit china the following february the announcements astounded the world the secrecy

state john foster dulles had refused to do in  when the two met in geneva over  television journalists accompanied the president on nixons orders television was strongly favored over printed publications as nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print it also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised nixon and kissinger met for an hour with mao and zhou at maos official private residence where they discussed a range of issues mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by nixon whom he considered forthright unlike the leftists and the soviets he also said he was suspicious of kissinger though the national security advisor referred to their meeting as his encounter with history a formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the great hall of the people the following day nixon met with zhou during this meeting he stated that he believed “there is one china and taiwan is a part of china” when not in meetings nixon toured architectural wonders including the forbidden city ming tombs and the great wall americans received their first glimpse into chinese life through the

at the time nixon took office about  american soldiers were dying each week in vietnam and the war was broadly unpopular in the united states with widespread sometimes violent protests against the war taking place on a regular basis including a protest at nixons inauguration the johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions but this agreement never fully took force according to walter isaacson soon after taking office nixon had concluded that the vietnam war could not be won and he was determined to end the war quickly conversely

however did not result in an agreement in july  nixon visited south vietnam where he met with his us military commanders and president nguyen van thieu amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout he implemented a strategy of replacing american troops with vietnamese troops known as vietnamization he soon instituted phased us troop withdrawals but authorized incursions into laos in part

with the escalated bombing led to claims that nixon had a credibility gap on the issue in  excerpts from the pentagon papers which had been leaked by daniel ellsberg were published by the new york times and the washington post when news of the leak first appeared nixon was inclined to do nothing the papers a history of united states involvement in vietnam mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations he was persuaded by kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared and the president tried to prevent publication the supreme court eventually ruled for the newspapers as us troop withdrawals continued conscription was reduced and in  ended the armed forces became allvolunteer after years of fighting the paris peace accords were signed at the beginning of  the agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining american troops however it did not require the  north vietnam army regulars located in

recruitment and popular support has been a matter of interest to historians some historians have cited the us intervention and bombing campaign as a significant factor leading to increased support of the khmer rouge among the cambodian peasantry however pol pot biographer david chandler argues that the bombing had the effect the americans wanted – it broke the communist encirclement of phnom penh chandler states that if you just made a very cold calculating military decision the bombing of  was in fact a sensible thing to do at the time because had it not happened the khmer rouge would have taken phnom penh much earlier and south vietnam would have had a communist country on its flank peter rodman and michael lind claimed that the us intervention saved cambodia from collapse in  and  craig etcheson agreed that it was untenable to assert that us intervention caused the khmer rouge victory while acknowledging that it may have played a small role in boosting recruitment for the insurgents william shawcross however wrote that the khmer rouge were born out of the inferno that american policy did much to create and that sihanouks collaboration with both powers the united states

taking office he stepped up covert operations against cuba and its president fidel castro he maintained close relations with the cubanamerican exile community through his friend bebe rebozo who often suggested ways of irritating castro these activities concerned the soviets and cubans who feared nixon might attack cuba in violation of the understanding between kennedy and khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis in august  the soviets asked nixon to reaffirm the agreement despite his hard line against castro nixon agreed the process—which began in secret but quickly leaked—had not been completed when the us deduced that the soviets were expanding their base at the cuban port of cienfuegos in october  a minor confrontation ensued which was concluded with an understanding that

development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles nixon and brezhnev proclaimed a new era of peaceful coexistence a banquet was held that evening at the kremlin richard nixon in kiev in  seeking to foster better relations with the united states both china and the soviet union cut back on their diplomatic support for north vietnam and advised hanoi to come to terms militarily nixon later described his strategy i had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in vietnam was to enlist if possible the help of the soviets and the chinese though rapprochement with china and détente with the soviet union were ends in themselves i also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war at worst hanoi was bound to feel less confident if washington was dealing with moscow and beijing at best if the two major communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept

anwar sadat of egypt june  as part of the nixon doctrine that the us would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible instead giving them assistance to defend themselves the us greatly increased arms sales to the middle east—particularly israel iran and saudi arabia—during the nixon administration the nixon administration strongly supported israel an american ally in the middle east but the support was not unconditional nixon believed that israel should make peace with its arab neighbors and that the united states should encourage it the president believed that—except during the suez crisis—the us had failed to intervene with israel and should use the leverage of the large us military aid to israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table however the arabisraeli conflict was not a major focus of nixons attention during his first term—for one thing he felt that no matter what he did american jews would oppose his reelection when an arab coalition led by egypt and syria attacked in october  beginning the yom kippur war israel suffered initial losses the us took no action for several days until nixon ordered an airlift to israel taking personal responsibility for any response by arab nations nixon cut through interdepartmental squabbles and bureaucracy to initiate an airlift of american arms by the time the us and soviet union negotiated a truce israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory a longterm effect was the movement of egypt away from the soviets toward the us but israels victory came at the cost to the us of the  oil crisis the members of opec decided to raise oil prices in response to the american support of israel after nixon chose to go off the gold standard foreign countries increased their currency reserves in anticipation of currency fluctuation which caused deflation of the dollar and other world currencies since oil was paid for in dollars opec was receiving less value for their product they cut production and announced price hikes as well as an embargo targeted against the united states and the netherlands specifically blaming us support for israel in the yom kippur war for the actions the embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the united states in late  and was eventually ended by the oilproducing nations as peace took hold kissinger played a major role in the settlement and was also able to

since the korean war and rising the great society had been enacted under johnson which together with the vietnam war costs was causing large budget deficits there was little unemployment  but interest rates were at their highest in a century nixons major economic goal was to reduce inflation the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war that however could not be accomplished overnight the administration adopted a policy of restricting the growth of the money supply to address the inflation problem in february  as a part of the effort to keep federal spending down nixon delayed pay raises to federal employees by six months when the nations postal workers went on strike he used the army to keep the postal system going in the end the government met the postal workers wage demands undoing some of the desired budgetbalancing according to political economist nigel bowless  study of nixons economic policies the new president did little to alter johnsons policies through the first year of his presidency the president and congressional republicans entered the  campaign season faced with unemployment inflation and democratic demands for an incomes policy all of which contributed to a lackluster republican performance in the midterm congressional elections republicans gained two seats in the senate but lost nine in the house democrats controlled both houses of congress throughout nixons presidency in  congress had granted the president the power to impose wage and price controls though the democratic congressional leadership knowing nixon had opposed such controls through his career did not expect nixon to actually use the authority with inflation unresolved by august  and an election year looming nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at camp david he then announced temporary wage and price controls allowed the dollar to float against other currencies and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold bowles points out by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflations defeat nixon made it difficult for democratic opponents  to criticize him his opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself nixons policies dampened inflation in  although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the ford administration as nixon began his second term the economy was plagued by a stock market crash and a surge in inflation with the legislation authorizing price controls set to expire on april  the senate democratic caucus recommended a day freeze on all profits interest rates and prices nixon reimposed price controls in june  echoing his  plan as food prices rose this time he focused on agricultural exports and limited the freeze to  days the price controls became unpopular with the public and business people who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy business owners however now saw the controls as permanent rather than temporary and voluntary compliance among small businesses decreased the controls and the accompanying food shortages—as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss—only fueled more inflation despite their failure to rein in inflation controls were slowly ended and on april   their statutory authorization lapsed ultimately inflation would rise to  by the end of the year governmental reorganizationedit nixon advocated a new federalism which would devolve power to state and local elected officials though congress was hostile about these ideas and enacted only a few of them nixon hoped to reduce the number of government departments to eight the existing departments of state justice treasury and defense with the remainder of the executive branch made parts of new departments of economic affairs natural resources human resources and community development although nixon did not succeed in this was able to convince congress to eliminate one cabinetlevel department the united states post office department which in july  as a result of the postal reorganization act was transformed into the united states postal service an independent entity within the executive branch of the federal government postmaster general winton m blount continued to serve through this transition until january   federal regulationsedit environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the  election the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject he saw that the first earth day in april  presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject and sought to use that to his benefit in june he announced the formation of the environmental protection agency epa broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his state of the union speeches other initiatives supported by nixon included the clean air act of  – expanding the federal mandate to control air pollution and protect air quality occupational safety and health act – establishing occupational safety and health administration osha and national institute for occupational safety and health niosh and the national environmental policy act – requiring environmental impact statements for many federal projects other significant regulatory legislation enacted during nixons presidency included the noise control act  marine mammal protection act  consumer product safety act  and the endangered species act  while applauding nixons progressive policy agenda environmentalists found much to criticize in his record the administration strongly supported continued funding of the noisepolluting supersonic transport sst which congress dropped funding for in  additionally he vetoed the clean water act of  and after congress overrode the veto nixon impounded the funds congress had authorized to implement it while not opposed to the goals of the legislation nixon objected to the amount of money to be spent on reaching them which he deemed excessive faced as he was with a generally liberal democratic congress perceived as being spendthrift in  john ehrlichman used the term creditcard congress nixon used this power on multiple occasions during his presidency congresss response came in the form of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of  which established a new budget process and included a procedure providing congressional control over the impoundment of funds by the president nixon mired in watergate signed the legislation july  healthcareedit in august  democratic senator ted kennedy introduced legislation to establish a singlepayer universal health care  financed by taxes and with no cost sharing nixon opposed the proposal in part because it would in his words put all health care under the heavy hand of the federal government the following february he proposed a national health insurance partnership a system combining a mandate requiring employers to buy private health insurance for their employees with an expanded federalized medicaid program for those who could not afford insurance this marketbased system would nixon argued build on the strengths of the private system a third proposal a limited american medical associationbacked medicredit voluntary tax credit plan was also introduced organized labor opposed both plans as did kennedy and the democratic leadership because they maintained a role for private insurers in the system private insurers were indifferent both the house ways and means and senate finance committee held hearings on national health insurance in  but no legislation emerged from either committee as healthcare reform languished the administrations focus shifted to an innovative concept involving health maintenance organizations hmos described by paul m ellwood as organizations groups of physicians and medical insurance providers that would compete on the bases of price and quality and that would combine insurance and health care in a single organization at the outset of the rd congress in january  kennedy introduced legislation providing for a trial federal program to promote and encourage the development of hmos legislation that later in the year became the health maintenance organization act of  there was a renewed push for health insurance reform in  in january representatives martha griffiths and james c corman introduced the health security act a universal national health insurance program providing comprehensive benefits without any cost sharing backed by the aflcio and uaw the following month nixon again proposed the comprehensive health insurance act private health insurance program employer mandatedvoluntary for employees with cost sharing in april kennedy and mills introduced the national health insurance act nearuniversal national health insurance program employer and employee mandated low cost sharing caps and financing by payroll and other taxes organized labor refused to support anything but its own proposal thus killing both the kennedymills plan and presidents union leaders hoped hoped to get a better deal after the  midterm elections that summer after nixons resignation and president fords call for health insurance reform mills tried to advance a compromise based on nixons plan but gave up when the conservative half of his committee instead backed the ama plan medical research initiativesedit nixon submitted two significant medical research initiatives to congress in february  the first popularly referred to as the war on cancer  resulted in passage that december of the national cancer act which injected nearly  billion equivalent to  billion in  in federal funding to cancer research over a threeyear period it also provided for establishment of medical centers dedicated to clinical research and cancer treatment  of them initially whose work is coordinated by the national cancer institute the second initiative focused on sicklecell disease scd resulted in passage of the national sickle cell anemia control act in may  long ignored the lifting of scd from obscurity to high visibility reflected the changing dynamics of electoral politics and race relations in america during the early s under this legislation the national institutes of health

an american apollo and a soviet soyuz spacecraft in  desegregationedit the nixon years witnessed the first largescale efforts to desegregate the nations public schools particularly in the south nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist wallace and liberal democrats whose support of integration was alienating some southern whites soon after beginning his first term nixon appointed vice president agnew to lead a task force which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools agnew had little interest in the work and most of it was done by labor secretary george shultz federal aid was available and a meeting with president nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees by september  less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools by  however tensions over desegregation surfaced in northern cities with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use in addition to desegregating public schools the administration worked to increase the number of racial minorities

local—to  later that year in oregon v mitchell  the supreme court held that congress had the authority to lower the voting age qualification in federal elections but not the authority to do so in state and local elections nixon sent a letter to congress supporting a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age and congress quickly moved forward with a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing the  yearold vote sent to the states for ratification on march   the proposal became the twentysixth amendment to the united states constitution on july   after being ratified by the requisite number of states  nixon also endorsed the equal rights amendment era which passed both houses of congress in  and was submitted to the state legislatures for ratification the amendment failed to be ratified by  states within the period set by congress for ratification nixon had campaigned as an era supporter in  though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the era or

the final days book film dick film v t e main articles watergate scandal and impeachment process against richard nixon the term watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the nixon administration those activities included dirty tricks such as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom nixon or his officials were suspicious nixon and his close aides ordered harassment of activist groups and political figures using the fbi cia and the irs these activities became known after five men were caught breaking into democratic national committee offices at the watergate complex in washington dc on june   the washington post picked up on the story reporters carl bernstein and bob woodward relying on an informant known as deep throat—later revealed to be mark felt associate director at the fbi—were able to link the men to the nixon administration the white house through presidential press secretary ron ziegler repeatedly dismissed woodward and bernsteins reports and tried to brush the incident aside as a third rate burglary attempt that august nixon categorically denied that any of his white house staff had prior knowledge of the crime and the episode had no impact on his reelection campaign he downplayed the scandal as mere politics calling news articles biased and misleading as a series of revelations later made it clear however nixon aides had committed crimes in attempts to sabotage the democrats and other by early in  senior aides such as white house counsel john dean and chief of staff h r haldeman faced prosecution in may  the senate conducted an investigation of the watergate scandal the investigation known as the watergate hearings was televised and widely watched as the various witnesses gave details not only of the watergate breakin but of various other alleged acts of malfeasance by various administration officials nixons approval rating plummeted on june  dean named nixon as having helped to plan the burglarys coverup and the following month white house aide alexander butterfield testified that nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the oval office these tapes were subpoenaed by watergate independent special prosecutor archibald cox nixon refused to release them citing executive privilege the white house and cox remained at loggerheads until october when nixon had cox fired in what was called the saturday night massacre the firing infuriated congress and engendered public protest on october  the house judiciary committee began consideration of possible impeachment procedures the following day leon jaworski was named as coxs replacement and soon thereafter the president agreed to turn over the requested tapes when the tapes were turned over a few weeks later nixons lawyers revealed that an audio tape of conversations held in the white house on june   featured an ½ minute gap rose mary woods the presidents personal secretary claimed responsibility for the gap alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape though her explanation was widely mocked the gap while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the president cast doubt on nixons statement that he had been unaware of the coverup that same month during an hourlong televised questionandanswer session with the press nixon insisted that he had made mistakes but had no prior knowledge of the burglary did not break any laws and did not learn of the coverup until early  he boldly declared people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook well im not a crook ive earned everything ive got a demonstrator demands nixons impeachment october  through the winter months nixon continued to deflect accusations of wrongdoing and vowed that he would be vindicated meanwhile in the courts and in congress developments continued to propel the unfolding saga toward a climax on march  a grand jury indicted seven former administration officials for conspiring to hinder the investigation of the watergate burglary the grand jury it was disclosed later also named nixon as an unindicted conspirator in april the house judiciary committee voted to subpoena tapes of  presidential conversations and the special prosecutor subpoenaed more tapes and documents as well the white house refused both subpoenas citing executive privilege once more in an unexpected move at the end of april the president announced the release of  pages of transcripts of white house conversations between him and his aides the house judiciary committee opened impeachment hearings against the president on may  these hearings which were televised culminated in votes for articles of impeachment the first being – in favor on july   on obstruction of justice six republicans voted yes along with all  democrats on july  the supreme court ruled unanimously that the full tapes not just selected transcripts must be released nixon oval office meeting with hr haldeman smoking gun conversation june   full transcript even though his base of support had been diminished by the continuing series of revelations nixon hoped to avoid impeachment however one of the newly released tapes the smoking gun tape recorded soon after the breakin demonstrated that nixon had been told of the white house connection to the watergate burglaries soon after they took place and had approved plans to thwart the investigation in a statement accompanying the release of the tapes on august   nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of the truth behind the watergate breakin stating that he had a lapse of memory with their release nixons popular support all but evaporated and his political support collapsed he met with republican congressional leaders two days later and was told he faced certain impeachment in the house and had at most  senators who might vote against his conviction on the articles of impeachment—far fewer than the  he needed to avoid removal from office that night knowing his presidency was effectively over nixon finalized his decision to resign resignation edit richard nixon resigns resignation speech of president richard nixon delivered august   problems playing this file see media help at  am on august  his last full day in office nixon met with vice president ford to inform him of the resignation decision and discus the presidential transition that evening nixon announced his intention to resign to the nation the speech was delivered from the oval office and was carried live on radio and television nixon stated that he was resigning for the good of the country as he had lost the political support in congress necessary to govern effectively and asked the nation to support the new president gerald ford nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency especially in foreign policy and concluded by expressing his personal philosophy about perseverance in public service sometimes i have succeeded and sometimes i have failed but always i have taken heart from what theodore roosevelt once said about the man in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly full text  nixon displays the vforvictory sign as he departs the white house after resigning august   nixons speech contained no admission of wrongdoing and was termed a masterpiece by conrad black one of his biographers black opined that what was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any american president nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue he left while devoting half his address to a recitation of his accomplishments in office the initial response from network commentators was generally favorable with only roger mudd of cbs stating that nixon had evaded the issue and had not admitted his role in the coverup nixon resigned from office on august   early that morning white house chief of staff alexander haig brought nixon a prepared letter of resignation which was addressed to secretary of state henry kissinger as required by the presidential succession act the brief letter read “i hereby resign the office of president of the united states” kissinger would subsequently sign his initials acknowledging that he had received it and write the time— am—denoting when nixons presidency officially ended then with his family at his side nixon gave an emotional farewell talk in the east room to an assembly of white house staff and cabinet officials afterward he and the first lady departed the white house for the last time this was the ninth time in us history that an incumbent president did not complete a term that he had been elected to it was however the first to occur for a reason other than death to date nixon is the only president to have resigned one month after leaving office

august   when he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office the first us president ever to do so he was succeeded by vice president gerald ford who had become vice president nine months earlier following spiro agnews resignation from office a republican nixon took office after the  presidential election in which he defeated hubert humphrey the then–incumbent vice president four years later in  he won reelection in a landslide victory over george mcgovern nixon the th united states president succeeded lyndon b johnson who had launched the great society a set of domestic programs financed and run by the federal government in contrast nixon advocated a new federalism domestic program model one in which certain powers would devolve back to the states the creation of the epa passage of the endangered species act and the integration of southern public schools happened during his presidency as did the end of military draft and the apollo program which successfully landed americans on the moon nixons primary focus while in office was on foreign affairs his foreign policy agenda known as the nixon doctrine called for indirect assistance to american allies in the cold war with the vietnamization of the vietnam war being the most notable example of his doctrine nixon pursued a detente with the peoples republic of china taking advantage of the sinosoviet split and significantly altering the nature of the cold war nixon also signed the antiballistic missile treaty and salt i two landmark arms control treaties with the soviet union nixons domestic and foreign policy accomplishments as president were however largely overshadowed by the scandals that enveloped his administration nixon was forced to resign from office after congress began impeachment proceedings in reaction to the watergate scandal he remains the only president to ever resign from office regarding his lasting legacy historian stephen ambrose wrote nixon wanted to be

convention the early favorite for the partys presidential nomination was michigan governor george romney later that year however his prospects foundered on the issue of vietnam and by the end of  nixon was according to time magazine the man to beat nixon entered the new year confident that with the democrats torn apart over the war in vietnam a republican had a good chance of winning although he expected the election to be as close as in  nixon won a resounding victory in the first republican party primary on march  in new hampshire winning  of the vote antiwar republicans wrote in the name of new york governor nelson rockefeller the leader of the gops liberal wing who received  of the vote he later defeated nixon in the massachusetts primary on april  but otherwise fared poorly in the state primaries and conventions that spring california governor ronald reagan emerged as the leading voice of republican conservatism attaining second place in two primaries and winning the contest in his home state at the republican national convention in miami beach florida reagan and rockefeller discussed joining forces in a stopnixon movement with each hoping to be nominated in a brokered convention no such movement materialized and nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot he selected maryland governor spiro agnew as his running mate a choice which nixon believed would unite the party appealing to both northern moderates and southerners disaffected with the democrats nixons acceptance speech was a message of hope we extend the hand of friendship to all people to the soviet people to the chinese people to all the people of the world and we work toward the goal of an open world open sky open cities open hearts open minds democrats began  expecting that president johnson who was constitutionally eligible for election to a second full term under the provisions of the nd amendment would again be the partys presidential nominee those expectations were shattered by senator eugene mccarthy who had entered the campaign late in november to give voice to those in the party opposed to johnsons vietnam policies mccarthy narrowly lost to johnson in the first democratic party primary on march  in new hampshire winning  of the vote to johnsons  the results startled the party establishment and spurred senator robert f kennedy of new york to enter the race two weeks later johnson told a stunned the nation that he would not seek a second term in the weeks that followed much of the momentum that had been moving the mccarthy campaign forward shifted toward kennedy this one of the most tumultuous democratic primary election seasons in modern times concluded with kennedy being assassination on june  in los angeles following a rally celebrating his victory in the california primary vice president hubert humphrey who announced his candidacy in late april saying he would run on the kennedyjohnson record but would be his own man won the presidential nomination at democratic national convention in chicago senator edmund muskie of maine was selected as his running mate outside the convention hall thousands of young antiwar activists who had gathered to protest the vietnam war clashed violently with police the mayhem which had been broadcast to the world in television crippled the humphrey campaign postconvention labor day surveys had humphrey trailing nixon by more than  percentage points  electoral vote results in addition to nixon and humphrey the race was joined by former democratic alabama governor george wallace a vocal segregationist who ran on the american independent party ticket throughout the campaign nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval he appealed to what he later called the silent majority of socially conservative americans who disliked the hippie counterculture and the antiwar demonstrators agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups solidifying nixons position with the right nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign meeting with supporters in front of cameras he stressed that the crime rate was too high and

remain very much open to debate nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to china prior to becoming president writing the before his election that there is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation assisting him in this venture was his national security advisor and future secretary of state henry kissinger with whom the president worked closely bypassing cabinet officials with relations between the soviet union and china at a nadir—border clashes between the two took place during nixons first year in office—nixon sent private word to the chinese through pakistan a country friendly to both china and united states that he desired closer relations with the chinese a breakthrough came in early  when chairman mao invited a team of american table tennis players to visit china and play against top chinese players nixon followed up by sending kissinger to china for clandestine meetings with chinese officials on

with mao and zhou at maos official private residence where they discussed a range of issues mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by nixon whom he considered forthright unlike the leftists and the soviets he also said he was suspicious of kissinger though the national security advisor referred to their meeting as his encounter with history a formal banquet welcoming the

times and the washington post when news of the leak first appeared nixon was inclined to do nothing the papers a history of united states involvement in vietnam mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations he was persuaded by kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared and the president tried to prevent publication the supreme court eventually ruled for the newspapers as us troop withdrawals continued conscription was reduced and in  ended the armed forces became allvolunteer after years of fighting the paris peace accords were

recruitment and popular support has been a matter of interest to historians some historians have cited the us intervention and bombing campaign as a significant factor leading to increased support of the khmer rouge among the cambodian peasantry however pol pot biographer david chandler argues that the bombing had the effect the americans wanted – it broke the communist encirclement of phnom penh chandler states that if you just made a very cold calculating military decision the bombing of  was in fact a sensible thing to do at the time because had it not happened the khmer rouge would have taken phnom penh much earlier and south vietnam would have had a communist country on its flank peter rodman and michael lind claimed that the us intervention saved cambodia from collapse in  and  craig etcheson agreed that it was untenable to assert that us intervention caused the khmer rouge victory while acknowledging that it may have played a small role in boosting recruitment for the insurgents william shawcross however wrote that the khmer rouge were born out of the inferno that american policy did much to create and that sihanouks collaboration with both powers the united states

suggested ways of irritating castro these activities concerned the soviets and cubans who feared nixon might attack cuba in violation of the understanding between kennedy and khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis in august  the soviets asked nixon to reaffirm the agreement despite his hard line against castro nixon agreed the process—which began in secret but quickly leaked—had not been completed when the us deduced that the soviets were expanding their base at the cuban port of cienfuegos in october  a minor confrontation ensued which was concluded with an understanding that

seeking to foster better relations with the united states both china and the soviet union cut back on their diplomatic support for north vietnam and advised hanoi to come to terms militarily nixon later described his strategy i had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in vietnam was to enlist if possible the help of the soviets and the chinese though rapprochement with china and détente with the soviet union were ends in themselves i also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war at worst hanoi was bound to feel less confident if

increased arms sales to the middle east—particularly israel iran and saudi arabia—during the nixon administration the nixon administration strongly supported israel an american ally in the middle east but the support was not unconditional nixon believed that israel should make peace with its arab neighbors and that the united states should encourage it the president believed that—except during the suez crisis—the us had failed to intervene with israel and should use the leverage of the large us military aid to israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table however the arabisraeli conflict was not a major focus of nixons attention during his first term—for one thing he felt that no matter what he did american jews would oppose his reelection when an arab coalition led by egypt and syria attacked in october  beginning the yom kippur war israel suffered initial losses the us took no action for several days until nixon ordered an airlift to israel taking personal responsibility for any response by arab nations nixon cut through interdepartmental squabbles and bureaucracy to initiate an airlift of american arms by the time the us and soviet union negotiated a truce israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory a longterm effect was the movement of egypt away from the soviets toward the us but israels victory came at the cost to the us of the  oil crisis the members of opec decided to raise oil prices in response to the american support of israel after nixon chose to go off the gold standard foreign countries increased their currency reserves in anticipation of currency fluctuation which caused deflation of the dollar and other world currencies since oil was paid for in dollars opec was receiving less value for their product they cut production and announced price hikes as well as an embargo targeted against the united states and the netherlands specifically blaming us support for israel in the yom kippur war for the actions the embargo caused gasoline

since the korean war and rising the great society had been enacted under johnson which together with the vietnam war costs was causing large budget deficits there was little unemployment  but interest rates were at their highest in a century nixons major economic goal was to reduce inflation the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war that however could not be accomplished overnight the administration adopted a policy of restricting the growth of the money supply to address the inflation problem in february  as a part of the effort to keep federal spending down nixon delayed pay raises to federal employees by six months when the nations postal workers went on strike he used the army to keep the postal system going in the end the government met the postal workers wage demands undoing some of the desired budgetbalancing according to political economist nigel bowless  study of nixons economic policies the new president did little to alter johnsons policies through the first year of his presidency the president and congressional republicans entered the  campaign season faced with unemployment inflation and democratic demands for an incomes policy all of which contributed to a lackluster republican performance in the midterm congressional elections republicans gained two seats in the senate but lost nine in the house democrats controlled both houses of congress throughout nixons presidency in  congress had granted the president the power to impose wage and price controls though the democratic congressional leadership knowing nixon had opposed such controls through his career did not expect nixon to actually use the authority with inflation unresolved by august  and an election year looming nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at camp david he then announced temporary wage and price controls allowed the dollar to float against other currencies and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold bowles points out by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflations defeat nixon made it difficult for democratic opponents  to criticize him his opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself nixons policies dampened inflation in  although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the ford administration as nixon began his second term the economy was plagued by a stock market crash and a surge in inflation with the legislation authorizing price controls set to expire on april  the senate democratic caucus recommended a day freeze on all profits interest rates and prices nixon reimposed price controls in june  echoing his  plan as food prices rose this time he focused on agricultural exports and limited the freeze to  days the price controls became unpopular with the public and business people who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy business owners however now saw the controls as permanent rather than temporary and voluntary compliance among small businesses decreased the controls and the accompanying food shortages—as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss—only fueled more inflation despite their failure to rein in inflation controls were slowly ended and on april   their statutory authorization lapsed ultimately inflation would rise to  by the end of the year governmental reorganizationedit nixon advocated a new federalism which would devolve power to state and local elected officials though congress was hostile about these ideas and enacted only a few of them nixon hoped to reduce the number of government departments to eight the existing departments of state justice treasury and defense with the remainder of the executive branch made parts of new departments of economic affairs natural resources human resources and community development although nixon did not succeed in this was able to convince congress to eliminate one cabinetlevel department the united states post office department which in july  as a result of the postal reorganization act was transformed into the united states postal service an independent entity within the executive branch of the federal government postmaster general winton m blount continued to serve through this transition until january   federal regulationsedit environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the  election the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject he saw that the first earth day in april  presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject and sought to use that to his benefit in june he announced the formation of the environmental protection agency epa broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his state of the union speeches other initiatives supported by nixon included the clean air act of  – expanding the federal mandate to control air pollution and protect air quality occupational safety and health act – establishing occupational safety and health administration osha and national institute for occupational safety and health niosh and the national environmental policy act – requiring environmental impact statements for many federal projects other significant regulatory legislation enacted during nixons presidency included the noise control act  marine mammal protection act  consumer product safety act  and the endangered species act  while applauding nixons progressive policy agenda environmentalists found much to criticize in his record the administration strongly supported continued funding of the noisepolluting supersonic transport sst which congress dropped funding for in  additionally he vetoed the clean water act of  and after congress overrode the veto nixon impounded the funds congress had authorized to implement it while not opposed to the goals of the legislation nixon objected to the amount of money to be spent on reaching them which he deemed excessive faced as he was with a generally liberal democratic congress perceived as being spendthrift in  john ehrlichman used the term creditcard congress nixon used this power on multiple occasions during his presidency congresss response came in the form of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of  which established a new budget process and included a procedure providing congressional control over the impoundment of funds by the president nixon mired in watergate signed the legislation july  healthcareedit in august  democratic senator ted kennedy introduced legislation to establish a singlepayer universal health care  financed by taxes and with no cost sharing nixon opposed the proposal in part because it would in his words put all health care under the heavy hand of the federal government the following february he proposed a national health insurance partnership a system combining a mandate requiring employers to buy private health insurance for their employees with an expanded federalized medicaid program for those who could not afford insurance this marketbased system would nixon argued build on the strengths of the private system a third proposal a limited american medical associationbacked medicredit voluntary tax credit plan was also introduced organized labor opposed both plans as did kennedy and the democratic leadership because they maintained a role for private insurers in the system private insurers were indifferent both the house ways and means and senate finance committee held hearings on national health insurance in  but no legislation emerged from either committee as healthcare reform languished the administrations focus shifted to an innovative concept involving health maintenance organizations hmos described by paul m ellwood as organizations groups of physicians and medical insurance providers that would compete on the bases of price and quality and that would combine insurance and health care in a single organization at the outset of the rd congress in january  kennedy introduced legislation providing for a trial federal program to promote and encourage the development of hmos legislation that later in the year became the health maintenance organization act of  there was a renewed push for health insurance reform in  in january representatives martha griffiths and james c corman introduced the health security act a universal national health insurance program providing comprehensive benefits without any cost sharing backed by the aflcio and uaw the following month nixon again proposed the comprehensive health insurance act private health insurance program employer mandatedvoluntary for employees with cost sharing in april kennedy and mills introduced the national health insurance act nearuniversal national health insurance program employer and employee mandated low cost sharing caps and financing by payroll and other taxes organized labor refused to support anything but its own proposal thus killing both the kennedymills plan and presidents union leaders hoped hoped to get a better deal after the  midterm elections that summer after nixons resignation and president fords call for health insurance reform mills tried to advance a compromise based on nixons plan but gave up when the conservative half of his committee instead backed the ama plan medical research initiativesedit nixon submitted two significant medical research initiatives to congress in february  the first popularly referred to as the war on cancer  resulted in passage that december of the national cancer act which injected nearly  billion equivalent to  billion in  in federal funding to cancer research over a threeyear period it also provided for establishment of medical centers dedicated to clinical research and cancer treatment  of them initially whose work is coordinated by the national cancer institute the second initiative focused on sicklecell disease scd resulted in passage of the national sickle cell anemia control act in may  long ignored the lifting

sought a middle way between the segregationist wallace and liberal democrats whose support of integration was alienating some southern whites soon after beginning his first term nixon appointed vice president agnew to lead a task force which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools agnew had little interest in the work and most of it was done by labor secretary george shultz federal aid was available and a meeting with president nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees by september  less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools by  however tensions over desegregation surfaced in northern cities with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial

state and local elections nixon sent a letter to congress supporting a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age and congress quickly moved forward with a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing the  yearold vote sent to the states for ratification on march   the proposal became the twentysixth amendment to the united states constitution on july   after being ratified by the requisite number of states  nixon also endorsed the equal rights amendment era which passed both houses of congress in  and was submitted to the state legislatures for ratification the amendment

protests such as those at the  democratic national convention and the  vietnam moratorium in an effort to turn us political opinion opinions concerning the war grew more polarized after the selective

the final days book film dick film v t e main articles watergate scandal and impeachment process against richard nixon the term watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the nixon administration those activities included dirty tricks such as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom nixon or his officials were suspicious nixon and his close aides ordered harassment of activist groups and political figures using the fbi cia and the irs these activities became known after five men were caught breaking into democratic national committee offices at the watergate complex in washington dc on june   the washington post picked up on the story reporters carl bernstein and bob woodward relying on an informant known as deep throat—later revealed to be mark felt associate director at the fbi—were able to link the men to the nixon administration the white house through presidential press secretary ron ziegler repeatedly dismissed woodward and bernsteins reports and tried to brush the incident aside as a third rate burglary attempt that august nixon categorically denied that any of his white house staff had prior knowledge of the crime and the episode had no impact on his reelection campaign he downplayed the scandal as mere politics calling news articles biased and misleading as a series of revelations later made it clear however nixon aides had committed crimes in attempts to sabotage the democrats and other by early in  senior aides such as white house counsel john dean and chief of staff h r haldeman faced prosecution in may  the senate conducted an investigation of the watergate scandal the investigation known as the watergate hearings was televised and widely watched as the various witnesses gave details not only of the watergate breakin but of various other alleged acts of malfeasance by various administration officials nixons approval rating plummeted on june  dean named nixon as having helped to plan the burglarys coverup and the following month white house aide alexander butterfield testified that nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the oval office these tapes were subpoenaed by watergate independent special prosecutor archibald cox nixon refused to release them citing executive privilege the white house and cox remained at loggerheads until october when nixon had cox fired in what was called the saturday night massacre the firing infuriated congress and engendered public protest on october  the house judiciary committee began consideration of possible impeachment procedures the following day leon jaworski was named as coxs replacement and soon thereafter the president agreed to turn over the requested tapes when the tapes were turned over a few weeks later nixons lawyers revealed that an audio tape of conversations held in the white house on june   featured an ½ minute gap rose mary woods the presidents personal secretary claimed responsibility for the gap alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape though her explanation was widely mocked the gap while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the president cast doubt on nixons statement that he had been unaware of the coverup that same month during an hourlong televised questionandanswer session with the press nixon insisted that he had made mistakes but had no prior knowledge of the burglary did not break any laws and did not learn of the coverup until early  he boldly declared people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook well im not a crook ive earned everything ive got a demonstrator demands nixons impeachment october  through the winter months nixon continued to deflect accusations of wrongdoing and vowed that he would be vindicated meanwhile in the courts and in congress developments continued to propel the unfolding saga toward a climax on march  a grand jury indicted seven former administration officials for conspiring to hinder the investigation of the watergate burglary the grand jury it was disclosed later also named nixon as an unindicted conspirator in april the house judiciary committee voted to subpoena tapes of  presidential conversations and the special prosecutor subpoenaed more tapes and documents as well the white house refused both subpoenas citing executive privilege once more in an unexpected move at the end of april the president announced the release of  pages of transcripts of white house conversations between him and his aides the house judiciary committee opened impeachment hearings against the president on may  these hearings which were televised culminated in votes for articles of impeachment the first being – in favor on july   on obstruction of justice six republicans voted yes along with all  democrats on july  the supreme court ruled unanimously that the full tapes not just selected transcripts must be released nixon oval office meeting with hr haldeman smoking gun conversation june   full transcript even though his base of support had been diminished by the continuing series of revelations nixon hoped to avoid impeachment however one of the newly released tapes the smoking gun tape recorded soon after the breakin demonstrated that nixon had been told of the white house connection to the watergate burglaries soon after they took place and had approved plans to thwart the investigation in a statement accompanying the release of the tapes on august   nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of the truth behind the watergate breakin stating that he had a lapse of memory with their release nixons popular support all but evaporated and his political support collapsed he met with republican congressional leaders two days later and was told he faced certain impeachment in the house and had at most  senators who might vote against his conviction on the articles of impeachment—far fewer than the  he needed to avoid removal from office that night knowing his presidency was effectively over nixon finalized his decision to resign resignation edit richard nixon resigns resignation speech of president richard nixon delivered august   problems playing this file see media help at  am on august  his last full day in office nixon met with vice president ford to inform him of the resignation decision and discus the presidential transition that evening nixon announced his intention to resign to the nation the speech was delivered from the oval office and was carried live on radio and television nixon stated that he was resigning for the good of the country as he had lost the political support in congress necessary to govern effectively and asked the nation to support the new president gerald ford nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency especially in foreign policy and concluded by expressing his personal philosophy about perseverance in public service sometimes i have succeeded and sometimes i have failed but always i have taken heart from what theodore roosevelt once said about the man in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly full text  nixon displays the vforvictory sign as he departs the white house after resigning august   nixons speech contained no admission of wrongdoing and was termed a masterpiece by conrad black one of his biographers black opined that what was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any american president nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue he left while devoting half his address to a recitation of his accomplishments in office the initial response from network commentators was generally favorable with only roger mudd of cbs stating that nixon had evaded the issue and had not admitted his role in the coverup nixon resigned from office on august   early that morning white house chief of staff alexander haig brought nixon a prepared letter of resignation which was addressed to secretary of state henry kissinger as required by the presidential succession act the brief letter read “i hereby resign the office of president of the united states” kissinger would subsequently sign his initials acknowledging that he had received it and write the time— am—denoting when nixons presidency officially ended then with his family at his side nixon gave an emotional farewell talk in the east room to an assembly of white house staff and cabinet officials afterward he and the first lady departed the white house for the last time this was the ninth time in us history that an incumbent president did not complete a term that he had been elected to it was however the first to occur for a reason other than death to date nixon is the only president to have resigned one month after leaving office
