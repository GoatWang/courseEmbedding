events trending tech insider finance politics strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × bill ackman is acting a lot like he did the last time he blew up a hedge fund linette lopez mar    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print reuters jack cusano part of why history repeats itself so often is that its so rare for grown people to change especially if they are masters of the universe accustomed to being right it is with that in mind that we examine the tragedy that is hedge fund billionaire bill ackmans portfolio he lost  billion on valeant pharmaceuticals on tuesday when the stocks value fell by half but instead of turning his back and cutting his losses he sent his investors a letter reaffirming his belief in the companys value telling them that he had a vision beyond what valeants own management could see in particular management shocked the market with revenue and earnings guidance for the next twelve months q  to q  which does not appear to foot with continued favorable prescription trends and managements commentary on the call about the strength of the underlying businesses  we continue to believe that the value of the underlying business franchises that comprise valeant are worth multiples of the current market price valeant is ackmans biggest loser — no question – and he has acknowledged that it dragged down his entire fund in  its worth saying here that nobody is suggesting that the drugmaker will mean the end of his hedge fund pershing square but whats going on now does seem familiar if you have followed ackmans career — and the hedge fund that did blow up in  gotham partners gotham partners  as with ackmans current drama the gotham partners mess was covered closely by the press how could it not be ackman and his partner david berkowitz were vanguards of the hedge fund pitch to the public of putting their secretive industry in the spotlight and on their website sharing ideas with the world today the practice is more common and not derided as an investor talking their book back then however the practice not only captured the attention of the entire market but it also caught the ire of eliot spitzer then new yorks attorney general uncomfortable to be sure but not fatal to the fund no ackmans fund failed when gotham partners morphed from a diversified hedge fund to a holding company with a portfolio of private companies and thinly traded public ones as the new york times wrote in  an examination of gothams activities in recent years shows a series of illtimed bets a surprising lack of diversification and a dangerous concentration in illiquid investments that could not easily be sold when investors wanted their money back the times wrote one of those companies was ackmans obsession it was called gotham golf and it swallowed gotham partners whole gotham partners started buying gotham golf a golfcourse operator in  as time passed the value of its assets declined but ackman and his partner kept buying up more golf courses the company got bigger and deeper into debt ackman then in his mids devised a plan to save the company he tried to merge it with the cashrich first union real estate equity and mortgage but first unions minority shareholders sued they would not allow the merger to go through ackman ran out of time gotham golf was going bankrupt and the rest of his positions were illiquid the timing was all wrong he shut his hedge fund down yahoo finance business insider valeant ackman started his current fund pershing square in  wall street raised an eyebrow and some of his original investors never got over the blowup at gotham still by  ackman had  billion under management in  pershing square had about  billion under management its now managing something like  billion valeant pharmaceuticals is responsible for a big chunk of that decline ackmans initial contact with the company was strange in  he made a deal to help valeant purchase allergan pharmaceuticals — without owning any valeant stock instead he bought allergan and as with first union pushed the other shareholders to accept a merger they did not being swallowed by valeant a socalled platform company that had a business model based on slashing researchanddevelopment spending hiking prices and growing by acquisition was not attractive to these shareholders ackman made money anyway though when a white knight bought allergan away from valeant the old wall street heads i win tails you lose scenario michael pearson chairman of the board and ceo of valeant pharmaceuticals international inc reuterschristinne muschi ackman bought some valeant stock in early  and it became his funds biggest position things were great until in october accusations of malfeasance from a short seller combined with government scrutiny over drugprice gouging brought the stock to its knees valeant was forced to change its business model it would have to sell more drugs at lower prices its distribution channel for highmargin products a mysterious pharmacy called philidor was dismantled by january pershing square was down  in  in large part because of this disaster but ackman was unmoved in a letter to investors he blamed those with thinner skin for following him into trades and selling when they lost conviction he said the market was wrong our biggest valuation error was assigning too much value to the socalled platform value in certain of our holdings he said in his yearend letter to investors we believe that platform value is real but as we have been painfully reminded it is a much more ephemeral form of value than pharmaceutical products operating businesses real estate or other assets as it depends on access to lowcost capital uniquely talented members of management and the pricing environment for transactions the value is real the environment is wrong so ackman held on being right all signs suggest ackman is wrong on valeant the platform the company created is worth a fraction of what it was even months ago government scrutiny alone prevents it from returning to its former business model to say nothing of the fact that investors in the companys  billion debt pile probably wouldnt allow it on tuesday management guided  revenue down to  billion to  billion from  billion to  billion the stock is down  just this year yet again ackman is defiant he says he will take on a greater role at the company he has managed to secure some board seats and has floated the idea of selling key parts of the business to pay down borrowings but that doesnt make valeants stock a buy and until it is ackman is stuck holding and forced to make of the situation what he can of course investors in pershing square will also have to remain patient if they can a luxury gotham investors were not afforded eventually a court overturned the gotham golffirst union decision ackmans merger could have gone through if hed had more time it was very instructive in many ways fellow investor whitney tilson told reuters in  ackman learned lessons from this perhaps or perhaps not for more on valeant listen to bis linette lopez and josh barro break it down on their podcast hard pass   now watch jim
