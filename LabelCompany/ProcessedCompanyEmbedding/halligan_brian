its my pleasure to turn over the call to our ceo and chairman brian halligan brian halligan thanks chuck and good afternoon folks thanks for joining us today as we review hubspots first quarter results lets jump right in and get to it hubspot kicked off  on a strong note first quarter revenue increased  nongaap operating profits improved by  points yearoveryear and we achieved nongaap operating profitability several quarters ahead of our own expectations i really love to see us growing this fast and profitable now in fact were off to a good start to the year overall with total sales and marketing customers having surpassed  and revenue retention up above  our move towards one hubspot was a pretty big shift for us naturally we expected to find some bumps in the road and we did but the team has really stepped up to the challenge im personally very happy with our first quarter results and the progress weve made in evolving hubspot from a singleproduct company toward a multiproduct company with the goal of becoming the midmarket growth platform something were calling one hubspot were making some great progress you might remember us talking about one hubspot and you might still be wondering whats up with this one hubspot thing anyway why change anything at all well its really simple our customers are looking for a platform for growth youve heard the same story repeatedly businesses are just spread out too thin internally theyve got too many different software solutions and theyve got their most important customer information in a bunch of different places this creates data silos within their team which is really difficult to manage as businesses scale and all this is affecting one important thing for them growth now weve offered a combined solution to address this problem for a while but until recently folks had to assemble their growth stack from  different sides of hubspot this caused friction frustration and frankly just made no sense what our customers want is one user interface to learn one number to call if they get stuck one bill to pay every month and one database for all their customer data putting all this together in one single platform is both incredibly powerful and valuable for our customers so at the beginning of the year we took a big step we combined our sales business with our marketing business to deliver one consistent and truly remarkable customer experience thats one hubspot before we started one hubspot we kept the sales product separate from our marketing products and that was for good reason it helped us learn some incredibly important things we couldnt have learned any other way most important thing we learned was how effective the freemium acquisition model can be we learned that our customers want to find solutions on their own roll up their sleeves and actually use it before they buy that was a pretty big insight it means that our products need to be useful and userfriendly so people can learn the ins and outs on their own increase their aptitude and appetite for more advanced features and eventually upgrade when theyre ready as i mentioned in my keynote at inbound we want to match the way we sell with the way customers shop and buy in  and our freemium products hubspot marketing free hubspot sales free and hubspot crm free allow us to do exactly that so hows it going well i think you can see it in the  total customers growing in excess of  while our average selling price on the total base of customers is lower compared to our marketing business our customer acquisition cost is lower as well and the beauty of it all is that these customers have the ability to upgrade over time which leads to higher revenue retention and happier more valuable customers to hubspot when i look at companies i admire like shopify and atlassian i see a common denominator and thats that they have this super lighttouch business model and a lot of their business happens without much human interaction at all this is one of the main challenges we set out for ourselves when we were developing the hubspot sales product line we asked ourselves how do we build a  gotomarket model that really matches the way we sell to the way humans actually want to shop and buy in that respect i think were all on our way especially when you think about the thousands and thousands of free users were bringing to our freemium channel who are adopting hubspot marketing sales and crm products with significantly less human touch lastly im excited about the momentum were seeing from our growth stack customers those that have adopted both our marketing and sales products thats important because our growth stack customers get even more value from us than our marketing standalone customers and that means it translates into a much higher total lifetime value per customer speaking of valuable growth stack customers the team recently had a conversation with renee smith president and cto of parking boxx about the beginning of their journey with hubspot parking boxx has a really unique business that leverages advanced software to make smart parking meters even smarter imagine that renee talked to us about the benefits of freemium and what it meant to her when she came across hubspot heres what she said when we originally came across hubspot we had  fundamental business challenges first we need to improve our topofthefunnel marketing activities to drive growth and optimize every step of the buyers journey to improve our bottomofthefunnel conversion rates while researching a number of different options we came across hubspot and read tons and tons of great information about you guys quite honestly though we couldnt quite figure out exactly how the hubspot marketing platform is going to help us achieve our goals renee continued we really wanted to sign up for a hubspot marketing product but decided instead to start out with your free crm to kind of get our feet wet and the fact that hubspot had these free products available without their traditional day limit was key for us it allowed us to adopt an important tool like crm on a time line that was comfortable for our team and allowed us to dig deeper into how we would implement and integrate the entire hubspot solution across our business over time renee goes on to talk about how much they value an intuitive crm that doesnt require a dedicated employee to manage it doesnt need additional customization or require a complex installation she says after using your free crm for about  months we continued to learn more and more about hubspot we reached a point where we could see a compelling value prop for adding both the hubspot marketing and sales product and this value prop was grounded in the ability to be able to clearly track the roi of our sales and marketing efforts across our campaigns from a lead to a proposal down to a sale having all our sales and marketing assets frankly all of our information in one single contact record from our chat logs to our phone calls to our website forms and being able to quantify the metrics and run advance reporting against it is absolutely huge to us while im excited to see renees journey from free to paid customer and that hubspot was able to provide some value upfront before asking for anything in return theres one thing that stuck out for me with her journey the real power of the growth stack sales plus marketing plus crm lies in the fact that our customer can have one single contact record as a source of truth marketing sees  can see exactly where a lead is in the sales cycle and sales can see all the marketing activities and behaviors theyre engaging in and together theyre all helping renees business grow i want to thank renee and the parking boxx team for sharing their journey and for so powerfully articulating what hubspot means to them weve been talking for awhile about the investments weve been making to be the growth platform for the midmarket and i think those investments are just beginning to bear fruit the goal in  is to build on this momentum and make it as simple as humanly possible for someone to begin using our platform and grow into the full growth stack okay with that ill turn it over to john now to take us through the financials and our guidance john kinzer thanks brian the first quarter got us off to a good start to the year here at hubspot we delivered strong revenue growth delivered almost  million of free cash flow and achieved positive nongaap operating profitability several quarters ahead of our own expectations first quarter revenue grew  driven by  subscription revenue growth and  services revenue growth as brian mentioned there are couple of initiatives that youll hear more and more about from us first were using the freemium model where it makes sense for certain customers this helped us surpass over  total paid customers in the quarter and it will help us scale the business going forward second were actively selling customers on the growth stack which helped drive our revenue retention to  in the quarter please note now that we have combined the sales business with the marketing business we have added sales proonly customers and their retention into the revenue retention calculation hubspot ended the quarter with  total customers which was up over  yearoveryear while total average subscription revenue per customer came in at  we ended the quarter with  marketing customers up  yearoveryear while marketing average subscription revenue per customer grew  to  the significant growth were seeing from our  per month marketing starter product once again boosted our customer growth but that combined with fx headwinds weighed on average subscription revenue per customer while this lowers our average subscription revenue per customer metric we believe there will be significant opportunity for marketing starter customers to upgrade over time deferred revenue came in at  million growing  yearoveryear while calculated billings defined as revenue plus the change in deferred revenue came in at  million up  versus the first quarter of  please remember that the billings growth will vary from revenue growth due to changes in billing terms as well as product mix and the timing of revenue recognition versus billing for the remainder of my commentary i will discuss nongaap results now lets take a look at our margins first quarter gross margin came in at  up  points yearoveryear and up  point versus the prior quarter first quarter subscription revenue gross margin came in at  up  points yearoveryear and over  point sequentially first quarter services gross margin came in at a negative  up over  points sequentially we continue to expect services margins to improve to breakeven levels over time and this quarters margins took a step in the right direction of achieving that goal first quarter operating margins improved  points yearoveryear to a positive  margin this improvement was driven by leverage across all cost line items including a full point from ga and more than  points of leverage from sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses beginning to see the benefit from the one hubspot transition as a percentage of near touchless revenue is increasing international revenue performance continued to be strong growing  yearoveryear and now represents  of our total revenue in the quarter at the end of the first quarter we had a total of  employees at hubspot up  yearoveryear capex including capitalized software was  million in the quarter slightly down from  million last year due to the timing of buildups we still expect capex as a percentage of revenue to average  for the year with that lets dive into guidance for the second quarter of  total revenue is expected to be in the range of  million to  million nongaap operating income is expected to be between a loss of  million to breakeven nongaap basic and diluted net income per share is expected to be between a loss of  to breakeven this assumes approximately  million basic shares outstanding and for the full year of  total revenue is expected to be in the range of  million to  million nongaap operating loss is expected to be between a loss of  million to a loss of  million nongaap net loss per share is expected to be between a loss of  to a loss of  this assumes approximately  million basic shares outstanding with the strong performance in first quarter free cash flow we now expect full year free cash flow to be between  million and  million up from our original annual expectation of a couple of million dollars as you adjust your models for  keep in mind the following on the operating margin front in the second quarter we expect slight headwinds from annual compensation adjustments as well as from the impact of some early inbound expenses third quarter operating margins will be negatively impacted by our inbound event by about  points and then we still expect fourth quarter to be profitable as i spoke about earlier were raising our free cash flow expectations for the year as you think about the quarterly linearity we anticipate strong free cash flow again in the fourth quarter but the second and third to be negative given material vendor payments in the second quarter and our inbound event in the third quarter with that ill hand the call back over to brian for his closing remarks brian brian halligan thanks john historically our industry has always admired the great success of enterprise software platforms i personally think the success of companies like shopify and atlassian and now hubspot has a lot to do with having much lighter more consumer style more modern acquisition gotomarket approaches its what todays customers and businesses want and demand its just another example of this enormous shift thats going on on how people want to shop and buy were in the business of helping our customers make that shift too its a huge ripple effect and its pretty darn exciting you sometimes hear folks talking about the good old days of saas software and heck of hubspot for that matter but frankly i think the good  no ill say the greatest days are firmly in front of us because one hubspot is all about achieving one shared goal with our customers partners and investors alike growth were on our way heres to a remarkable future together we want to close by thanking hubspots employees all our customers our great partners and investors hubspots a team sport and we have a great team operator you can open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions for your first question comes from the line of terry tillman from raymond james terrell tillman just a couple of questions and i jumped on a little late so if these questions have already been addressed i apologize just first starting with the marketing business seeing the segmentation of the  sides i think is very helpful i think you all talked about  growth do you foresee over a sustained period growing well in excess of digital marketing with your marketing automation platform i think the industry is pegged at call it highteens to about  do you think you can sustain that kind of growth in your original product or better john kinzer yes so terry its john clearly we care about growth both in the marketing and sales side more and more were going to talk about total customer growth and that was growing over  in the quarter its still very underpenetrated what were really thinking about is customers should come in the way they want whether they come in with sales or they come in with marketing whatever makes sense and then well upsell and crosssell them over time so lots of opportunity for growth very underpenetrated so we think we have a long runway here terrell tillman okay and just the followup question relates to i think john you mentioned in the past you guys can have opportunities for being more dynamic and fluid in terms of pricing and packaging strategies as you roll out a billing system could you update us on how thats coming along and how we could think about opportunities to maybe add more skus change pricing et cetera in the back half of the year john kinzer yes so yes so were going through a whole implementation of a billing system thats ongoing were making progress on that front probably get through that by the end of the year and then i think that there will be more opportunities we look at pricing from time to time we look at it the low end the high end and we just make sure were meeting the  all sectors of the customer needs thats part of the reason we came out with the marketing starter product so we were capturing those smaller customers that well grow with us over time and so we do like the flexibility this new system will allow us to make some of those tweaks going forward operator your next question comes from the line of tom roderick from stifel thomas roderick so im interested in the feedback that you might have from the partner channel community as you rolled out the one hubspot approach here what are you hearing from that community both domestic and internationally what kind of feedback are they getting from their customers and how do you see this sort of rippling through as youve been successful early on in introducing sales as a separate sku to your sales force how is that going with the channel brian halligan tom its brian thats a great question we just had all our toptier partners in north america in last week it was great it was great to see them all theyve all grown up with us and most of them have grown up with us on the marketing side and built nice businesses right alongside us and what were seeing is they are fired up about the sales product and many of them i would say most of them have already sold the sales product and many of them are looking to build the sales practice and extend their way down the funnel when they do that their customers are stickier for them they add more value the retainers are bigger so i would say were off  off to the races theyre feeling really good thomas roderick and listen im sure im getting ahead myself on this but you guys have kind of cleared this hurdle in terms of some of the concerns around what it would mean to roll this out as a separate product it sounds like youre having some success with the feedback on crm its early there at what point would it start to make sense is it any time in the next year or  where you could take a similar approach on that roll out pricing i know its freemium today but curious how youre thinking about that product is that still more lead gen and keep it off the side as freemium or could you see someday that actually becoming its own separate product in the same way that sales has become brian halligan yes for now we like where were positioned there we offer the crm product for free it turns out its an ideal product to be free the cogs are quite low on crm and its going well lots and lots of people are using it a lot of people using that product and liking it and we see it as an engine of growth not just for the sales product but for the marketing product were starting to figure out how to pull crm users then get them to be active and then they buy that sales product and thats all we need leads and a user marketing product and the next thing you know theyre using all  and really running their whole business on hubspot or at lease their whole growth stack on hubspot so for now just no plans to change it in the short term very happy with the way its going so far operator your next question comes from the line of brad sills from bank of america bradley sills i wanted to ask about the addon products particularly reports some of the feedback from the channels coming back that customers that are running sales have a higher propensity to add on reports and analytics it seems like that could potentially be a good play for you guys just curious if thats what youre seeing any commentary on what these growth stack customers could mean to potential upsell opportunity for some of the addon products brian halligan its a great question the reporting addon is going well its growing were pretty happy with it the nice thing about that reporting addon is it does work with both the marketing and sales product as youve astutely noticed as that sales product gets better and crm gets better i think more and more companies will use it bigger companies will use it and theyll want that reporting addon so over the long haul i think that will be good the reporting product is still pretty new and lots and lots of opportunities to enhance it improve it and i think it can be a really valuable piece of the puzzle over the long haul to both sides of our business bradley sills great then one more if i may please on the salesonly customers you mentioned good traction upselling those folks to marketing what is the sales cycle like there i mean what is the typical sales cycle versus i guess the cold lead if you will coming in kind of do to hubspot brian halligan yes almost all of the sales revenue thats coming in is really through that super light touch they start using the crm and they play around with some of the sales features and then they buy the sales product so thats working out really well frankly were just getting started i would say were starting to really crank on selling the sales product to the marketing customers were just starting on selling the marketing product to the sales customers thats a pretty new motion for us but what i like about hubspot is we sort of this growing marketing business that we can sell our sales product to we have this growing sales business we can sell our marketing product to its going to be the gift that keeps on giving for us for many many years to come operator your next question comes from the line of stan zlotsky from morgan stanley stan zlotsky so maybe just at a highlevel clearly very strong results that you guys put up this quarter what did you see behind the scenes from a sales force productivity now that sales have been introduced into the full sales force brian halligan its brian im feeling pretty good about it i mean theres a lot of change we put our sales org through last year they really just did sold the marketing product for the first  years of hubspot and on jan  we flipped it and now they could sell not only the marketing product but they could sell the sales product but the other change is also this lighter touch model we moved from kind of a classic inside sales model to much more of a freemium lighter touch model so we put them through a lot of change and a lot of system change and training changes and overall i think they handled it pretty well and did quite well wasnt perfect we skinned our knees a little bit as we expected but i think were on a good path and feeling good about where the reps are and where ppr is stan zlotsky got it and maybe just one for john john as we  as we head through this year how do you think billings shape as we go through the year what kind of seasonality do we think we need to keep in mind as were adjusting our models john kinzer yes stan so when you think about billings its different from the metrics we guide to just given the things that can impact it product mix billing terms timing all those different things weigh into that the billings number and thats why its not a number that we guide to but i think in general the billings and revenue are somewhat tied obviously billings preceded a little bit but i think that as you look at our guidance i think thats one indicator the one thing is inbound being in third quarter could help third quarter but it is the last week of third quarter so probably that spills into fourth quarter so i dont see a real difference in seasonality in the billings growth from last year operator your next question comes from the line of alex zukin from piper jaffray aleksandr zukin i wanted to ask brian youve kind of seen sales pro really take off it sounds like in this quarter and if we think about what kind of contribution you would expect from sales pro of either revenue or bookings by the end of the year whats the right way for us to think about and judge your success on that product and then separately for john as you  you mentioned that part of the outperformance on profitability and cash flow was the result of this lighter touch model im guess im curious longer term if you are successful and continue to execute on this model how does that change your longer term operating model in terms of what percentage sales and marketing ultimately has to represent as a percentage of revenue with this lighter touch model brian halligan ill take the first one its brian the sales pro business is going well really happy with it the product is good the customers seem to really like it its getting nice traction i still consider it very very early compared to the marketing business very underpenetrated lots and lots and lots of opportunity there so im not sure the percentage by the end of the year im not sure we give that number out but feeling very very good about the traction were getting there the gotomarket model i think our sales organization is figuring out how to sell it i think the prop is getting better so feeling good john kinzer yes alex so as we think about it were encouraged on how the freemium model can help our long term model getting those customers in at a very lowcost and then upselling them obviously upselling is much lower cost to us than brandnew customers we think it should have a positive impact and if anything we should get that leverage in sales and marketing we started to see some of that in the quarter if anything well lean into rd a little bit more it could get up we had said  is our long term model i think it went down to about  in the quarter so i think you could see us continuing to invest in rd to really make that freemium model work and get more and more leverage on sales and marketing so we feel good about what it means to the long term model aleksandr zukin got it and john maybe just piggyback on stans question on billings did you see  were there any headwinds that you saw on billings in the quarter and then any way for us to think about potential headwinds as a result of the mix shifting it for q john kinzer yes i mean the one thing is that sales business i think we talked a lot about it we get about  to  months upfront on those theyre really credit card billed customers its a much faster motion and i think that works versus the marketing thats more like  to  months upfront so yes that can have a bit of a pressure on billings but the revenue will flesh out so from that standpoint not a problem but could put a little bit pressure on billings but as i said to stan i think that thinking about revenue growth and the billings fairly tied is a good way to think about it and then one last thing is alex is that there is a little bit of pressure on fx were seeing about a point or so on that just based on where the euro has been operator your next question comes from the line of derrick wood from cowen  company derrick wood and i guess staying on that fx topic we heard you guys may have taken prices up in international maybe uk to adjust for the big hit in foreign currency and the pound is that true and is that something material enough that may have impacted your guidance for the year john kinzer yes  no it was something that we did but it wasnt material no just making that adjustment trying to keep up with that but so far its been received fine and that was really  just derrick just to be clear that was just on the pound derrick wood okay just in the uk okay and john you mentioned and i may not have heard this right but changes in revenue recognition could impact billing so it could be one of the factors in creating kind of noise in the billings number i dont know if that  if i heard that right but just wondering john kinzer yes im sorry if  i dont know if i said  i dont think i said changes its just the difference between revenue recognition and billings will cause differences in the growth rate from a revenue and billings standpoint because billings happens right up front you get that revenue over  months and so theyre not perfectly correlated but theyre definitely correlated derrick wood got it and any  with asc  coming anything to expect there that would impact  john kinzer yes  no we started looking at that so far and it looks pretty immaterial to us but more to come on that in the future but yes we dont expect a material impact from  operator your next question comes from the line of mark murphy from jpmorgan albert chi this is actually albert chi on for mark i had a question about competition and i think were aware the usual players on the marketing side but now that youre kind of evolving into sales and when youre out in the field for the paid sales products can you talk about who youre typically seeing or who you anticipate seeing in the future brian halligan yes i mean on the sale side theres a lot of kind of smaller sales crm products have been out there in the market a lot of companies that use spreadsheet to track whats going on and its a lot of that frankly people moving from spreadsheets to their first adult crm system and moving from kind of a smaller point solution to something a little bit more powerful and integrated with marketing thats most of the competition were seeing today and i think were very well positioned the product is sort of  have a very consumer feel to it very easytouse and set up we have to get it in such a way because were using a freemium model so its just very very intuitive and easytouse at the same time its powerful it does a lot of things and its really well matched with the way salespeople sell today theyll  right into the way they do email i think we really hit the nail in the ahead with that crm product were feeling good about it so thats sort of the competitive set that we certainly compete with salesforcecom from time to time its an interesting relationship with them its  we cooperate a lot with them and we compete a little bit with them and i feel like were doing pretty well there albert chi great and just one followup actually so i wanted to ask about the marketing starter packages that you talked about last quarter and how that  what that means for marketing customer growth and so can you talk about the dynamic between the marketing arpu that  we saw kind of a little bit flattish in terms of growth or  from quarterto quarter and how that plays into marketing customer growth do you think that number could accelerate from here john kinzer so on the marketing starter clearly that was great for the customer count you saw that play out and those are  those  come in at a smaller level so well take that tradeoff on asrpc in the short term for the upsell we can get later and so you will see that continue to benefit our customers  customer count as we go forward and well endeavored up so thats where we come in so we think  we like how the marketing starter is working right now operator your next question comes from the line of jesse hulsing from goldman sachs jesse hulsing i had a question about retention and you guys have a lot of interesting things going on with the freemium product and the sales product you have customers that are evolving from singleproduct customers to kind of platform customers and im wondering what you think that does to churn on a customer basis and on a dollar basis and i know its early but what are kind of the early findings that youre seeing in the data on that front brian halligan yes jesse i think its early of course but intuitively it just makes sense when somebody is using the marketing product alone it has a certain value proposition it is super valuable and its sticky in its own right and weve got an interesting pricing model there where we can grow with them but boy when theyre using that marketing product coupled with the crm and coupled with that sales product its  intuitively it is stickier the early signs are those are going to be stickier the wordofmouth will be better those customers will just get more value from us so were hoping the bet is that over time as this business develops and as the percentage of our installed base of growth stack customers versus standalone expands that we can incrementally improve our retention rates over time jesse hulsing okay and then john a quick followup on the marketing customer question from before what was the tailwind from adding freemium yearoveryear i think last quarter it was  basis points was it something similar can you quantify that john kinzer yes i think thats probably about right about a similar impact on that but as we continue to add those marketing customers especially those lowerprice marketing starter customers youll see it in asrpc but well take that tradeoff it gives us a chance to upsell those customers but more and more youre going to have us talk more about total customers because really were fine with people coming in at marketing fine with people coming in at sales getting them in and getting them in at a lower cost because ultimately we get them in and then we can upsell them its really good for our economics operator your next question comes from the line of ian strgar from ubs ian strgar nice job on the quarter so if i could just kind of add on to a prior question i wanted to dig in on the upselling motion of selling a sales customer the marketing product can you just give us any more detail on kind of where youre at with that specific selling motion and if theres any catalyst or any time this year that you think that that sales funnel of just sales customers might really kind of crystallize into a repeatable funnel to sell more marketing brian halligan okay ian thats a good question i dont have the exact number at my fingertips but i think the number of sales customers that bought marketing was in about the  range so its definitely starting and we have many thousands of sales customers adding a lot of sales customers per month and so thats the potential  youre asking about a real interesting potential growth engine for us and its starting to run and its starting to work it really helps with economics because we bring that sales customer and the cost required of that customer is so low theyre using the product then they buy the marketing product the total lifetime value of that customer is very high over time were very very early though in teaching our sales organization how to do it and getting learnings and really baking it in i would stay tuned on it but its a nice opportunity for us ian strgar okay great and the revenue retention over  was really impressive this quarter is there anything in particular you guys have mentioned growth stack as a tailwind for that is there anything else or anything in particular that could keep the strength in that metric going or anything that could keep leading to increases in that metric john kinzer yes and im glad you asked that so yes were happy to have it over  the one thing  i do want to be careful  i dont know if you heard it in the script as we move to more focusing on total customers we wanted to align the revenue retention definition to that obviously it makes perfect sense in the past since revenue retention was just based on marketing customers the only benefit were getting from the sales business is when marketing customers bought the sales product so now that were recording all of our customers in that total customer count were defining revenue retention as total customers and if sales customers upsell that counts if marketing customers that counts or if marketing sells  buy sales or sales buys marketing so all of that is now in that definition so a little bit of that benefit was just that new definition but we feel like if we can really get that motion down as brian said if we can really get those sales customers to buy the marketing product we think theres opportunity to continue to improve from here on the retention front operator your next question comes from the line of ross macmillan from rbc capital markets ross macmillan i think many of mine have been answered but i did want to just ask a couple of clarifications number one is  the total customer number i  that has to include both full stack and standalone sales pro customers is that a true statement and then second if i back out marketing and think about asrpc for call it total less marketing and then think about the implied sales pro product price i was getting to about  sales pro users per customer and i wanted to see if that ballpark was about right john kinzer yes so the total customer number is total customers that have marketing or sales and so yes the growth stacks in there but they wouldnt be double counted wed only count them once so just clarifying that the number of sales seats per customer i havent looked at the exact number but its been around the  to  range probably now slightly above the  so your  to  might be a little high but probably in the ballpark operator your next question comes from the line of koji ikeda from oppenheimer koji ikeda just one quick one from me and kind of a big picture question here now that the company has been executing on the one hubspot gotomarket strategy for a couple of months have you noticed any changes in the conversations or sales cycle with potential customers i mean i guess what im getting at is have the conversations at prospects may be moved up the food chain a little bit away from business unit managers maybe up to the c suite or the presidents at these companies and the conversations are more on digital transformation brian halligan koji thats a good question its definitely changing  the change i am seeing is companies are kind of making a stack decision theyre saying were going to be a hubspot stack or a decentralized stack or even a salesforce stack and more and more were seeing that unified stack and thats part of the conversation if we already got the marketing product in there gosh that makes the stack decision easier if we get them  the sales product in there that makes that stack decision easier and i think that will continue its just like for example for myself i use a macintosh and i use an iphone and im kind of an apple guy and i think companies will become hubspot companies or home front office will be hubspots so i think thats a trend were starting to see were pushing but the customers are also pulling on it operator your next question comes from the line of samad samana from stephens inc samad samana first now that you guys have had the cheaper marketings you have for about   months can you give us any data around that cohort in terms of how many were able to move to a higher tier versus what the churn looks like for that lowerdollar tier and then i have a followup question brian halligan i think thats you john kinzer yes so its still early days samad on the marketing starter we have seen probably  or  upgrade to the pro products which is pretty exciting starting at  going up to something  to x of that so its still early days but its good to see that early progress on the marketing starter customers samad samana and then maybe one more followup john in that same vein if you think about  what is the growth rate for marketing customers look like if you look at it across the skus right maybe directionally what is yearoveryear growth and units for pro look like versus enterprise i think that will help us in terms of our models and how we think about it excluding the lowerdollar sku john kinzer yes samad i dont have that number right in front of me i think its been fairly consistent i dont see a big change in those  in the mix of basic pro and enterprise operator your next question comes from the line of scott berg from needham  company peter levine great this is peter levine in for scott so i know  so you reached  nongaap gross margin in the quarter quicker than we expected so congrats on that indiscernible names so how should we view gross margins longer term any color on what you think you can attain john kinzer yes so i think weve really been able to capitalize on getting our product gross margins up to the mids pretty pretty exciting to see that happen really leveraging the aws infrastructure and really making sure we finetune that we probably got product gross margins about to where we can get them as we think about the services gross margins we actually made some progress this quarter got that latched down we might see a little bit of a headwind in the second quarter as we go through our annual raise process as well as just hiring for the rest of the year but we feel like we can continue to get some leverage on that services margin ultimately getting it to breakeven so i think the leverage if any on the gross margins going forward is really going to be a mix as well as some improvement on the services side but well still see leverage on the ga side and as i talked about before with the freemium model we really are starting to get some leverage on sales and marketing so were really excited to hit profitability in the quarter and well continue to improve that over time peter levine final question here is any special service programs or incentives you put in place for the quarter and if not this quarter do you expect to put any of these promotions in play for the year i guess similar to what you guys did back in the third quarter of  john kinzer so no plans right now but obviously we wouldnt tip our hat if were going to use it its obviously from a sales execution standpoint but nothing nothing planned right now operator your next question comes from the line of abhinav kapur from btig abhinav kapur two quick ones from me could you give the growth stack customer count i think it was about  of the total installed base last quarter and second one is also a partner count for the quarter john kinzer yes so let me answer that first question on the growth stack growth stack was up nicely in the quarter but as we said for the past were going to give numbers when we hit milestones on that growth stack pleased with how it came in in the quarter but not a specific number there brian halligan on the partner count we dont  i dont at least obsess about that number anymore kind of started making a shift in the partner program back in q really just a little bit less focused on the number of partners and more focused on the quality of partners how we bring a great partner in thats really motivated to deeply engage with us and grow alongside us and really resell the products so theres been a little bit of a shift in our thinking i think that partner number is up its a big number over time i want more partners that are more deeply engaged with us selling the full suite of products and partner program is going well here in the us im going over to the celtic nation of ireland next week and meeting with all the european partners and really excited about that if any of the european partners are on looking forward to seeing you all operator there are no further

brian halligan is ceo  cofounder of hubspot a marketing software company that helps businesses transform the way they market their products by getting found on the internet bhalligan ceo  cofounder hubspotbhalligan write a comment brian halligan hubspot credit video transcript brian halligan the other thing i really like about inbound marketing versus traditional marketing is you win by loving up your customers by giving them love versus outbound traditional marketing is about irritating your way into peoples chuckle pockets i got a story this sales rep at a qa consulting company on the west coast and he cold calls me and he cold calls me everyday monday at  am and every thursday at  am right on the dot like hes got it on a tickler he calls me and leaves me a very very nice voice message hes got a good phone voice leaves me a nice message and he leaves me a voicemail about his qa testing software the problem is im not interested in his qa testing software so its an ineffective use of his time but whats extra bad about that is its irritating me and its kind of ruining his brand when i think about that qa testing software company and hes probably calling a thousand ceos and hes probably got a hundred sales reps over there and theyre just destroying their brand so traditional marketing is not only less effective over time but its actually hurting i think most peoples brands halligan and so what i want marketers to do is create marketing people love marketing like lulu lemon type of marketing people love lulu lemon like charity water like apple like nike really create marketing people love so you might ask yourself well how do i do that how do i transform my marketing to match the way humans actually buy stuff today how do i pull people in how do i really do this new type of marketing brians talking about halligan well theres two pieces to it the first piece is about creating content lots and lots of content when i think about your marketing department i wanna think about your marketing department like its showtime like its hbo like its cnn like its pbs your marketers should be creating tons and tons and tons of content creating it your own marketing assets those assets are pulling in you shouldnt be renting space and other assets build your own permanent sustainable assets so think of your marketing department like a production company cnn showtime hbo one of those guys and so the first of it is just creating lots of content you can create any kind of content blog articles webinars ebooks videos you name it each piece of content pulls people in halligan now heres the catch if you write a piece of content thats kind of crappy its a magnet but it doesnt pull that hard if you write a piece of content thats brilliant thats genius its this massive magnet that pulls people in from twitter facebook linkedin you wanna create remarkable content what you wanna be is not boring it turns out most companies are boring dont be boring with whatever you do create content you the ceo should create content everyone in your company should be creating lots and lots of content use that content to pull people in i dont care where you publish it but publish it through all these different channels this is the way you market your way to success halligan but its not just about creating content you have to very clever about optimizing that content if you want it to go viral i was listening to some of the questions to the last speaker if you want the content to really spread you need to optimize it for seo google search engine optimization and smo social media optimization a lot of you probably already know about seo smos relatively new when i think about smo i just think about the work stream so youve got emails coming through i got tweets coming through facebook posts i got all this stuff coming through to me you have to be able when youre thinking about optimizing to create a title thats really quite clever thats gonna entice people to click on it if you write a really nice piece of content and a crap title no ones ever gonna click on it its not gonna go anywhere if you write a really nice piece of content and a brilliant title my gosh that thing will spread like wild fire thats how you create a great article that pulls in a lot of twitter followers and facebook likes and pulls in a lot of customers you have to get great in creating lots of remarkable content and optimizing it halligan and then the third step is you have to be very clever about how you start promoting this stuff how do i promote it in youtube in linkedin in facebook in twitter and start to become a ninja at social media the analogy i like to think of lets just say im a lion and my favorite food as a lion is i like to eat elephants right my favorite food is elephants and for years im climbing through the jungle and im eating elephants elephants from the jungle im climbing through the jungle and eating the elephants and all of a sudden theyre gone and im like where did the fucking elephants go halligan it turns out all the elephants left the jungle and theyre on the savannah and theres a few watering holes in this space theres a google watering hole right theres a twitter watering hole a pinterest watering hole a linkedin watering hole a facebook watering hole you need to get the hell out of the jungle and over to the savannah cause thats where your customers are and get over yourself if you think theyre still in the jungle your customers are on facebook your customers are searching google the opinions
