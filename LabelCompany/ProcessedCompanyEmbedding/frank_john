defendant johnson  johnson products jjp to a suit of long underwear she had also used defendants product to fashion a headpiece complete with ears the costume covered mr ferlito from his head to his ankles except for his face and hands which were blackened with halloween paint at the party mr ferlito attempted to light his cigarette by using a butane lighter the flame passed close to his left arm and the cotton batting on his left sleeve ignited plaintiffs sued defendant for injuries they suffered from burns which covered approximately onethird of mr ferlitos body following a jury verdict entered for plaintiffs november   the honorable ralph m freeman entered a judgment for plaintiff frank ferlito in the amount of  and for plaintiff susan ferlito in the amount of  judgment was entered november   subsequently on november   defendant jjp filed a timely motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to fedrcivp b or in the alternative for new trial plaintiffs filed their response to defendants motion december   and defendant filed a reply january   before reaching a decision on this motion judge freeman died the case was reassigned to this court april   after a status conference june   the court ordered defendant to file a complete trial transcript and to file a supplemental brief discussing the applicability of fedrcivp  plaintiffs were given thirty days to respond to defendants supplemental brief both parties filed timely briefs oral argument on defendants motion was heard april   the court having read the pleadings heard oral argument and being otherwise familiar in the premises grants defendant jjps motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to rule  of the federal rules of civil procedure the court is granted broad discretion in deciding the present motion if by reason of death sickness or other disability a judge before whom an action has been tried is unable to perform the duties to be performed by the court under these rules after a verdict is returned or findings of fact and conclusions of law are filed then any other judge regularly sitting in or assigned to the court in which the action was tried may perform those duties fedrcivp  judge freeman died before ruling on defendants motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative for new trial after a jury verdict was returned rule  clearly states that as the successor judge i may perform those duties motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict issuance of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov is authorized by rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure which provides in relevant part whenever a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is not granted the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion not later than  days after entry of judgment a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with the partys motion for a directed verdict a new trial may be prayed for in the alternative if a verdict was returned the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed rule b fedrcivp defendant jjp filed two motions for a directed verdict the first on october   at the close of plaintiffs proofs and the second on october   at the close of defendants proofs judge freeman denied both motions without prejudice judgment for plaintiffs was entered november   and defendants instant motion filed november   was filed in a timely manner the standard for determining whether to grant a jnov is identical to the standard for evaluating a motion for directed verdict in determining whether the evidence is sufficient the trial court may neither weigh the evidence pass on the credibility of witnesses nor substitute its judgment for that of the jury rather the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made drawing from that evidence all reasonable inferences in his favor morelock v ncr corp  fd   th cir cert denied  us   sct   ledd   if after reviewing the evidence however the trial court is of the opinion that reasonable minds could not come to the result reached by the jury then the motion for jnov should be granted toth v yoder co  fd   th cir the trial court makes its determination as a matter of law id oneill v kiledjian  fd   th cir to recover in a failure to warn product liability action a plaintiff must prove each of the following four elements of negligence  that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff  that the defendant violated that duty  that the defendants breach of that duty was a proximate cause of the damages suffered by the plaintiff and  that the plaintiff suffered damages beyette v ortho pharmaceutical corp  fd   th cir warner v general motors corp  michapp    nwd   leave to appeal denied to establish a prima facie case that a manufacturers breach of its duty to warn was a proximate cause of an injury sustained a plaintiff must present evidence that the product would have been used differently had the proffered warnings been given mowery v crittenton hospital  michapp    nwd   downie v kent products  michapp    nwd   dunn v lederle laboratories  michapp    nwd   muilenberg v upjohn co  michapp    nwd   in the absence of evidence that a warning would have prevented the harm complained of by altering the plaintiffs conduct the failure to warn cannot be deemed a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury as a matter of law dunn  michapp at   nwd  similarly a failure to warn cannot be deemed a proximate cause of injury if the plaintiff knew of the danger about which he claims the defendant failed to warn vroman v sears roebuck  co  fd  th cir a manufacturer has a duty to warn the purchasers or users of its product about dangers associated with intended use rusin v glendale optical co inc  fd   th cir conversely a manufacturer has no duty to warn of a danger arising from an unforeseeable misuse of its product trotter v hamil manufacturing co  michapp   nwd   thus whether a manufacturer has a duty to warn depends on whether the use of the product and the injury sustained by it are foreseeable gootee v colt industries inc  fd   th cir owens v allischalmers corp  mich    nwd   whether a plaintiffs use of a product is foreseeable is a legal question to be resolved by the court trotter supra whether the resulting injury is foreseeable is a question of fact for the jury thomas v international harvester co  michapp   nwd   in the instant action no reasonable jury could find that jjps failure to warn of the flammability of cotton batting was a proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries because plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence to establish that a flammability warning on jjps cotton batting would have dissuaded them from using the product in the manner that they did plaintiffs repeatedly stated in their response brief that plaintiff susan ferlito testified that she would never again use cotton batting to make a costume plaintiffs answer to defendant jjps motion for jnov pp     however a review of the trial transcript reveals that plaintiff susan ferlito never testified that she would never again use cotton batting to make a costume more importantly the transcript contains no statement by plaintiff susan ferlito that a flammability warning on defendant jjps product would have dissuaded her from using the cotton batting to construct the costume in the first place at oral argument counsel for plaintiffs conceded that there was no testimony during the trial that either plaintiff susan ferlito or her husband plaintiff frank j ferlito would have acted any differently if there had been a flammability warning on the products package the absence of such testimony is fatal to plaintiffs case for without it plaintiffs have failed to prove proximate cause one of the essential elements of their negligence claim in addition both plaintiffs testified that they knew that cotton batting burns when it is exposed to flame susan ferlito testified that she knew at the time she purchased the cotton batting that it would burn if exposed to an open flame frank ferlito testified that he knew at the time he appeared at the halloween party that cotton batting would burn if exposed to an open flame his additional testimony that he would not have intentionally put a flame to the cotton batting shows that he recognized the risk of injury of which he claims jjp should have warned because both plaintiffs were already aware of the danger a warning by jjp would have been superfluous therefore a reasonable jury could not have found that jjps failure to provide a warning was a proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries the evidence in this case clearly demonstrated that neither the use to which plaintiffs put jjps product nor the injuries arising from that use were foreseeable susan ferlito testified that the idea for the costume was hers alone as described on the products package its intended uses are for cleansing applying medications and infant care plaintiffs showing that the product may be used on occasion in classrooms for decorative purposes failed to demonstrate the foreseeability of an adult male encapsulating himself from head to toe in cotton batting and then lighting up a cigarette motion for new trial defendant jjp has moved in the alternative for a new trial lest there be any confusion over the consequences of a reversal of the judgment in favor of the defendant the court will grant a new trial if for any reason the court of appeals for the sixth circuit reverses the decision to grant defendants motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in determining whether to grant a motion for new trial unlike a motion for jnov the trial court may weigh the evidence presented a court can exercise its discretion to grant a new trial if the verdict even though supported by sufficient evidence to defeat a motion for jnov is against the great weight of the evidence taylor v home ins co  fd   th cir the decision to grant or deny a new trial is one confided almost entirely in the exercise of discretion on the part of the trial court morin v johnsmanville sales corp  fd   th cir defendant jjp predicates its motion for new trial on two grounds first jjp argues that the jurys verdict was against the great weight of evidence presented at trial for the reasons set forth supra i agree second jjp argues that the jurys verdict was inconsistent when a jury returns a verdict which is inconsistent the trial court must attempt to reconcile the verdict where a verdict cannot be reconciled a new trial must be granted hopkins v coen  fd   th cir in the instant case the jury was given a special verdict form the jury was asked whether jjp was negligent in failing to warn plaintiffs of the flammability of cotton batting the jury was also asked whether plaintiffs were negligent the jury responded affirmatively to both questions finding plaintiffs  percent negligent however the only evidence upon which the jury could base a finding of comparative negligence by plaintiffs was their use of cotton batting to construct a costume and their exposure of that costume to an open flame the jurys finding of comparative negligence necessarily means that it concluded that plaintiffs knew or should have known of the flammability of cotton batting if that was the jurys conclusion then jjp had no duty to warn and the jurys verdict ignored the courts instructions the court is satisfied that the test for a new trial described in bruner v dunaway  fd   th cir in order to grant a new trial the verdict must be against the clear weight of evidence has been met here order now therefore it is hereby ordered that defendant jjps motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is granted it is further ordered that the judgment entered november   is set aside it is further ordered that the clerk will enter a judgment in favor of the defendant jjp comment your name your email comments  characters remaining
