purchasei had to have this for class it is crazy wordy i cant decide if the author is highly intelligent wants me to think he is highly intelligent or wants me to believe the material is incredibly complicated one third of the book is reference citations literally it is a book about research but if you are going to include every reference at the end then there is no need to add them in the text

starseven topics i already know about like cognitive dissonance are hard to read throughbyshelby raffion october  format paperbackverified purchasegod this book is dry reading it for class is just a pain to get though even topics i already know about like cognitive dissonance are hard to read through not because it doesnt make sense but okeefe just has this way of using big words and filling every sentence with interjections and it just doesnt need to be this difficult these topics are fun but they dont read that way he also ends most chapters by saying basically that we really dont know anything about the topic he just told us about because research shows it not to be true or hasnt been conducted or the terms arent defined well or consistently and it leaves me wondering why i am bothering to learn it in the first placecomment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address belowproduct not
