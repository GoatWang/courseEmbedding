columbia evolved from british possessions that were established in what is now british columbia by  first nations the original inhabitants of the land have a history of at least  years in the area today there are few treaties and the question of aboriginal title long ignored has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions notably the tsilhqotin

with service producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the provinces gdp it is the endpoint of transcontinental railways and the site of major pacific ports that enable international trade though less than  of its vast  km  sq mi land is arable the province is agriculturally rich particularly in the fraser and okanagan valleys because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction principally logging farming and mining vancouver the provinces largest city and metropolitan area also serves as the headquarters of many westernbased natural resource companies it also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average while the coast of british columbia and certain valleys in the southcentral part of the province have mild weather the majority of its land mass experiences a

etymologyedit the provinces name was chosen by queen victoria when the colony of british columbia ie the mainland became a british colony in  it refers to the columbia district the british name for the territory drained by the columbia river in southeastern british columbia which was the namesake of the preoregon treaty columbia department of the hudsons bay company queen victoria chose british columbia to distinguish what was the british sector of the columbia district from that of the united states american columbia or southern columbia which became the oregon territory on august   as a result of the treaty ultimately the columbia in the name british columbia is derived from the name of the columbia rediviva an american ship which lent its name to the columbia river and later the wider region the columbia in the name columbia rediviva came from the name columbia for the new world or parts thereof a reference to christopher columbus geographyedit main article geography of british columbia british columbias geography is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief which has defined patterns of settlement and industry since colonization british columbia is bordered by the pacific ocean on the west side by the american state of alaska to the northwest and parts of the west on the north by yukon and the northwest territories on the east by the province of alberta and on the south by the states of washington idaho and montana the current southern border of british columbia was established by the  oregon treaty although its history is tied with lands as far south as california british columbias land area is  square kilometres  sq mi british columbias rugged coastline stretches for more than  kilometres  mi and includes deep mountainous fjords and about  islands most of which are uninhabited it is the only province in canada that borders the pacific ocean british columbias capital is victoria located at the southeastern tip of vancouver island only a narrow strip of the island from campbell river to victoria is significantly populated much of the western part of vancouver island and the rest of the coast is covered by thick tall and sometimes impenetrable temperate rainforest the provinces most populous city is vancouver which is located at the confluence of the fraser river and georgia strait in the southwest corner of the mainland an area often called the lower mainland by land area abbotsford is the largest city vanderhoof is near the geographic centre of the province the coast mountains and the inside passages many inlets provide some of british columbias renowned and spectacular scenery which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and ecotourism industry seventyfive percent of the province is mountainous more than  metres  ft above sea level  is forested and only about  is arable the provinces mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the pacific ocean terrain ranges from dry inland forests and semiarid in numerous valleys to the range and canyon districts of the central and southern interior to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the northern interior the okanagan area extending from near vernon to osoyoos at the united states border is one of several wine and ciderproducing regions in canada other wine regions in british columbia include the cowichan valley on vancouver island and the fraser valley the southern interior cities of kamloops and penticton have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in canada although their temperatures can be exceeded north of the fraser canyon close to the confluence of the fraser and thompson rivers where the terrain is rugged and covered with deserttype flora semidesert grassland is found in large areas of the interior plateau with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones the northern mostly mountainous twothirds of the province are largely unpopulated and undeveloped except for the area east of the rockies where the peace river district in the northeast of the province contains bcs portion of the canadian prairies centred at dawson creek climateedit köppen climate types in british columbia strait of georgia near vancouver coastal southern british columbia has a mild rainy oceanic climate some far southern parts of which are warmsummer mediterranean influenced by the north pacific current which has its origins in the kuroshio current due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges the climate of the interior of the province is semiarid with certain locations receiving less than  mm  in annual precipitation the annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to  °c  °f the mildest anywhere in canada the valleys of the southern interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow while those in the cariboo in the central interior are colder because of increased altitude and latitude but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in canada for example the average daily low in prince george roughly located in the middle of the province in january is − °c  °f heavy snowfall occurs in all elevated mountainous terrain providing bases for skiers in both south and central british columbia winters are generally severe in the northern interior but even there milder air can penetrate far inland the coldest temperature in british columbia was recorded in smith river where it dropped to − °c − °f on january   one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in north america atlin in the provinces far northwest along with the adjoining southern lakes region of yukon get midwinter thaws caused by the chinook effect which is also common and much warmer in more southerly parts of the interior during winter on the coast rainfall sometimes relentless heavy rain dominates because of consistent barrages of cyclonic lowpressure systems from the north pacific average snowfall on the coast during an average winter is between  and  cm  and  in but on occasion and not every winter heavy snowfalls with more than  cm  in and well below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas typically for short periods and can take temperatures below − °c  °f even at sea level and arctic outflow winds can make wind chill temperatures at or even below − °c  °f for a couple of mornings while winters are very wet coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer under the influence of stable anticyclonic high pressure southern interior valleys are hot in summer for example in osoyoos the july maximum temperature averages  °c  °f the hottest month of any place in canada this hot weather sometimes spreads towards the coast or to the far north of the province temperatures often exceed  °c  °f in the lower elevations of valleys in the interior during midsummer with the record high of  °c  °f being held in lytton on july   the okanagan region has a climate suitable to vineyards the extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires from drylightning or manmade causes many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during the winter months in contrast to abundant summer sunshine annual sunshine

indigenous peoples of the northwest plateau and the canadian crown and aboriginal peoples the area that is now known as british columbia is home to first nations groups that have a deep history with a significant percentage of indigenous languages there are more than  first nations in bc prior to contact with nonaboriginal people human history is known from archaeological investigations an oral history of first nations groups and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period the arrival of paleoindians from beringia took place between  and  years ago hunter gatherer families were the main social structure from  to  years ago the nomadic population lived in nonpermanent structures foraging for nuts berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs around  years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary lifestyle these indigenous populations evolved over the next  years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs to the northwest of the province are the peoples of the nadene languages which include the athapaskanspeaking peoples and the tlingit who lived on the islands of southern alaska and northern british columbia the nadene language group is believed to be linked to the yeniseian languages of siberia the dene of the western arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from asia to north america the interior of british columbia was home to the salishan language groups such as the shuswap secwepemc okanagan and athabaskan language groups primarily the dakelh carrier and the tsilhqotin the inlets and valleys of the british columbia coast sheltered large distinctive populations such as the haida kwakwakawakw and nuuchahnulth sustained by the regions abundant salmon and shellfish these peoples developed complex cultures dependent on the western red cedar that included wooden houses seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved potlatch items and totem poles contact with europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from europe that the people had no immunity to the result was a dramatic population collapse culminating in the  smallpox outbreak in victoria that spread throughout the coast european settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of british columbia colonial officials deemed that colonists could make better use of the land than the first nations people and thus the land territory be owned by the colonists to ensure colonists would be able to settle properly and make use of the land natives were relocated onto

la bodega y quadra explored the coast in  in doing so pérez and quadra reasserted the spanish claim for the pacific coast first made by vasco núñez de balboa in  the explorations of james cook in  and george vancouver in – established british jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the columbia river in  sir alexander mackenzie was the first european to journey across north america

succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the canadian prairies and the pacific mackenzie and other explorers—notably john finlay simon fraser samuel black and david thompson—were primarily concerned with extending the fur trade rather than political considerations in  by the third of a series of agreements known as the nootka conventions spain conceded its claims of exclusivity in the pacific this opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers including britain but because of the napoleonic wars there was little british action on its claims in the region until later the establishment of trading posts under the auspices of the north west company and the hudsons bay company hbc effectively established a permanent british presence in the region the columbia district was broadly defined as being south of ° north latitude the southern limit of russian america north of mexicancontrolled california and west of the rocky mountains it was by the angloamerican convention of  under the joint occupancy and use of citizens of the united states and subjects of britain which is to say the fur companies this cooccupancy was ended with the oregon treaty of  the major supply route was the york factory express between hudson bay and fort vancouver some of the early outposts grew into settlements communities and cities among the places in british columbia that began as fur trading posts are fort st john established  hudsons hope  fort nelson  fort st james  prince george  kamloops  fort langley  fort

columbia district colville washington and walla walla washington old fort nez percés with the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in  the region now comprising british columbia existed in three fur trading departments the bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the new caledonia district administered from fort st james the interior south of the thompson river watershed and north of the columbia was organized into the columbia district administered from fort vancouver on the lower columbia river the northeast corner of the province east of the rockies known as the peace river block was attached to the much larger athabasca district headquartered in fort chipewyan in presentday alberta until  these districts were a wholly unorganized area of british north america under the de facto jurisdiction of hbc administrators unlike ruperts land to the north and east however the territory was not a concession to the company rather it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the first nations inhabitants all that was changed with the westward extension of american exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty especially in the southern columbia basin within present day washington and oregon in  the oregon treaty divided the territory along the th parallel to the strait of georgia with the area south of this boundary excluding vancouver island and the gulf islands transferred to sole american sovereignty the colony of vancouver island was created in  with victoria designated as the capital new

trading post managers colony of british columbia –edit main articles colony of british columbia – and richard clement moody with the fraser canyon gold rush in  an influx of americans into new caledonia prompted the colonial office to designate the mainland as the colony of british columbia when news of the fraser canyon gold rush reached london richard clement moody was handpicked by the colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and found a second england on the shores of the pacific lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force he sought men who possessed courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the english gentleman and british officer at the head of the royal engineers columbia detachment moody and his family arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary in british columbia moody wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending miles to the right  left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities  yet fr the background of superb mountains swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbingport moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor later gold rushesedit a series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed the largest being the cariboo gold rush in  forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of farflung boom communities like barkerville and lillooet which sprang up overnight the vancouver island colony was facing financial crises of its own and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in  when the colony of british columbia was amalgamated with the colony of vancouver island to form the colony of british columbia – which was in turn succeeded by the present day province of british columbia following the canadian

condition of entry into confederation the confederation league including such figures as amor de cosmos john robson and robert beaven led the chorus pressing for the colony to join canada which had been created out of three british north american colonies in  the province of canada nova scotia and new brunswick several factors motivated this agitation including the fear of annexation to the united states the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth the need for governmentfunded services to support this population and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush

colony agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile fraser valley and cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the thompson river area the cariboo the chilcotin and the okanagan forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast which was also the locus of a growing fishery the completion of the railway in  was a huge boost to the provinces economy facilitating the transportation of the regions considerable resources to the east the milltown of granville known as gastown near the mouth of the burrard inlet was selected as the terminus of the railway prompting the incorporation of the city as vancouver in  the completion of the port of vancouver spurred rapid growth and in less than fifty years the city surpassed winnipeg manitoba as the largest in western canada the early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically its settlement and development—were paramount this included expropriation from first nations people of their land control over its resources as well as the ability to trade in some resources such as the fishery establishing a labour force to develop the province was problematic from the start and british columbia was the locus of immigration from europe china and japan the influx of a noncaucasian population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups resulting in agitation much of it successful to restrict the ability of asian people to immigrate to british columbia through the imposition of a head tax this resentment culminated in mob attacks against chinese and japanese immigrants in vancouver in  and  by  almost all chinese immigration had been blocked except for merchants professionals students and investors meanwhile the province continued to grow in

vote in the prohibition of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hardcore drinking that vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war because of pressure from veterans prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the soldier and the working man could enjoy a drink but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by european immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of soldier parties to represent their interests variously named soldierfarmer soldierlabour and farmerlabour parties these formed the basis of the fractured labourpolitical spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties including those who would eventually form the cooperative commonwealth and the early social credit splinter groups internment camp for the japanese canadians during world war ii the advent of prohibition in the united states created new opportunities and many found employment or at least profit in crossborder liquor smuggling much of vancouvers prosperity and opulence in the s results from this pirate economy although growth in forestry fishing and mining continued the end of us prohibition combined with the onset of the great depression plunged the province into economic destitution compounding the already dire local economic situation tens of thousands of men from colder parts of canada swarmed into vancouver creating huge hobo jungles around false creek and the burrard inlet rail yards including the old canadian pacific railway mainline rightofway through the heart of the citys downtown at hastings and carrall increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts an occupation of the main post office at granville and hastings which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of martial law on the docks for almost three years a vancouver contingent for the ontoottawa trek was organized and seized a train which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a gatling gun straddling the tracks at mission the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the depression there were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the s but it was the onset of world war ii which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the depression because of the war effort women entered the workforce as never before british columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the pacific ocean to have close relations with east asia however this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward asian immigrants this was most manifest during the second world war when many people of japanese descent were relocated or interned in the interior of the province coalition and the postwar boomedit the bc regiment dcor marching in new westminster  during world war ii the mainstream bc liberal and bc conservative parties of british columbia united in a formal coalition government under new liberal leader john hart who replaced duff pattullo when the latter failed to win a majority in the  election while the liberals won the most number of seats they actually received fewer votes than the socialist cooperative commonwealth federation ccf pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival conservatives led by royal maitland and was replaced by hart who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five liberal and three conservative ministers the ccf was invited to join the coalition but refused the pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of world war ii was to prevent the ccf which had won a surprise victory in saskatchewan in  from ever coming to power in british columbia the ccfs popular vote was high enough in the  election that they were likely to have won threeway contests and could have formed government however the coalition prevented that by uniting the antisocialist vote in the postwar environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects notably the completion of highway  north of prince george to the peace river block a section called the john hart highway and also public hospital insurance in  the reins of the coalition were taken over by byron ingemar johnson the conservatives had wanted their new leader herbert anscomb to be premier but the liberals in the coalition refused johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in british columbia history  in the  election this victory was attributable to the popularity of his governments spending programmes despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power during his tenure major infrastructures continued to expand such as the agreement with alcan aluminum to build the town of kitimat with an aluminum smelter and the large kemano hydro project johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the  flooding of the fraser valley which was a major blow to that region and to the provinces economy increasing tension between the liberal and conservative coalition partners led the liberal party executive to vote to instruct johnson to terminate the arrangement johnson ended the coalition and dropped his conservative cabinet ministers including deputy premier and finance minister herbert anscomb precipitating the general election of  a referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot similar to a preferential ballot where voters could select second and third choices the intent of the ballot as campaigned for by liberals and conservatives was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the ccf but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties including the ccf voted for the fringe british columbia social credit party socreds who wound up with the largest number of seats in the house  only one seat ahead of the ccf despite the ccf having  of the vote to social credits  the social credit party led by rebel former conservative mla w a c bennett formed a minority government backed by the liberals and conservatives with  and  seats respectively bennett began a series of fiscal reforms preaching a new variety of populism as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development laying the ground for a second election in  in which the new bennett regime secured a majority of seats with  of the vote secure with that majority bennett returned the province to the firstpastthepost system thereafter which is still in use today –sedit with the election of the social credit party british columbia embarked on a phase of rapid economic development bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry mining and energy sectors during these two decades the government nationalized british columbia electric and the british columbia power company as well as smaller electric companies renaming the entity bc hydro west kootenay power and light remained independent of bc hydro being owned and operated by cominco though tied into the regional power grid by the end of the s several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the peace columbia and nechako river watersheds the nechako diversion to kemano was to supply power to the alcan inc aluminum smelter at kitimat and was not part of the provincial power grid but privately owned major transmission deals were concluded most notably the columbia river treaty between canada and the united states the provinces economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector as well as oil and gas development in the provinces northeast the s and s were also marked by development in the provinces transportation infrastructure in  the government established bc ferries as a crown corporation to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system also supported by federal grants as being part of the transcanada highway system that system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges and paving of existing highways and provincial roads vancouver and victoria became cultural centres as poets authors artists musicians as well as dancers actors and haute cuisine chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures with the cultural and entrepreneurial community notably bolstered by many draft dodgers from the united states similarly these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics commentators and creative thinkerscitation needed tourism also began to play an important role in the economy the rise of japan and other pacific economies was a great boost to british columbias economy primarily because of massive exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees politically and socially the s brought a period of significant social ferment the divide between the political left and right which had prevailed in the province since the depression and the rise of the labour movement sharpened as socalled free enterprise parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by social credit—in opposition to the social democratic new democratic party the successor to the cooperative commonwealth federation as the provinces economy blossomed so did labourmanagement tensions tensions emerged also from the counterculture movement of the late s of which vancouver and nanaimo were centres the conflict between hippies and vancouver mayor tom campbell was particularly legendary culminating in the socalled gastown riots of  by the end of the decade with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the status quo rising the bennett governments achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity s and sedit on august   the social credit party was reelected in a general election for what would be bennetts final term in power at the start of the s the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector however bc hydro reported its first loss which was the beginning of the end for bennett and the social credit party the socreds were forced from power in the august  election paving the way for a provincial new democratic party ndp government under dave barrett under barrett the large provincial surplus soon became a deficitcitation needed although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous social credit regime and its two sets of books as wac bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management the brief threeyear thousand days period of ndp governance brought several lasting changes to the province most notably the creation of the agricultural land reserve intended to protect farmland from redevelopment and the insurance corporation of british columbia a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing singlepayer basic automobile insurance perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too farreaching coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the ndp in the  general election social credit under wac bennetts son bill bennett was returned to office under the younger bennetts government  of the provinces land base was transferred from government reserve to management by the ministry of forests reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the premiers office and ndpinstigated social programs were rolled back with thenhuman resources minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy although the newera socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the ndp—notably the creation of the resort municipality of whistler whose special status including sunday drinking then an anomaly in bc also during the miniwac regime a reference to his fathers acronym wac certain moneylosing crownowned assets were privatized in a mass giveaway of shares in the british columbia resources investment corporation bcric with the brick shares soon becoming nearworthless towards the end of his tenure in power bennett oversaw the completion of several megaprojects meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most rightwing parties british columbias social credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy most notable of these was the winning of a worlds fair for vancouver which came in the form of expo  to which was tied the construction of the coquihalla highway and vancouvers skytrain system the coquihalla highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premiers brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal the doman scandal in which the premier and millionaire backer herb doman were investigated for insidertrading and securities fraud nonetheless the socreds were reelected in  under bennett who led the party until  the coquihalla highway the road was one of the legacies of the expo  worlds fair the creation of the toll highway sparked controversy as the province entered a sustained recession bennetts popularity and media image were in decline on april   premier bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government and the lieutenantgovernor henry pybus bellirving was forced to call bennett to government house to resolve the impasse and an election was called for april  while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the executive council no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis campaigning on a platform of moderation bennett won an unexpected majority after several weeks of silence in the aftermath a sitting of the house was finally called and in the speech from the throne the socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed restraint which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign the programme included cuts to motherhood issues of the left including the human rights branch the offices of the ombudsman and rentalsman womens programs environmental and cultural programs while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate british columbia this sparked a backlash with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to  people this became known as the  solidarity crisis from the name of the solidarity coalition a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized consisting of organized labour and community groups with the british columbia federation of labour forming a separate organization of unions operation solidarity under the direction of jack munro thenpresident of the international woodworkers of america iwa the most powerful of the provinces resource unions tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a general strike would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the ndp and the left just as a strike at pacific press ended which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the provinces major papers the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and iwa president jack munro and premier bennett a tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued as among the new laws were those enabling nonunion labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues with companies from alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with unionscale british columbia companies despite the tension bennetts last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with expo and bennett was to end his career by hosting prince charles and lady diana on their visit to open expo  his retirement being announced a social credit convention was scheduled for the whistler resort which came down to a threeway shooting match between bud smith the premiers righthand man but an unelected official social credit party grande dame grace mccarthy and the charismatic but eccentric bill vander zalm bill vander zalm became the new socred leader when smith threw his support to him rather than see mccarthy win and led the party to victory in the election later that year vander zalm was later involved in a conflict of interest scandal following the sale of fantasy gardens a christian and dutch culture theme park built by the premier to tan yu a filipino chinese gambling kingpin there were also concerns over yus application to the government for a bank licence and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor faye leung of a party in the howard hughes suite on the top two floors of the bayshore inn where tan yu had been staying with reports of a bag of money in a brown paper bag passed from yu to vander zalm during the goingson these scandals forced vander zalms resignation and rita johnston became premier of the province johnston presided over the end of social credit power calling an election which led to the reducing of the partys caucus to only two seats and the revival of the

expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade despite political turmoil harcourt ended up resigning over bingogate—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo

the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in british columbia an allegation never substantiated that the premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to clarks resignation as premier he was succeeded on an interim basis by dan miller who was in turn followed by ujjal dosanjh following a leadership convention in the  general election gordon campbells bc liberals defeated the ndp gaining  out of  total seats in the provincial legislature campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the ndps policies including scrapping the fast ferries project lowering income taxes and the controversial sale of bc rail to cn rail campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for driving under the influence during a vacation in hawaii however campbell still managed to lead his party to victory in the  general election against a substantially strengthened ndp opposition campbell won a third term in the british columbia general election  marking the first time in  years that a premier has been elected to a third term the province won a bid to host the  winter olympics in vancouver and whistler as promised in his

responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid sixtyfour percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games after the olympic joy had faded campbells popularity started to fall his management style the implementation of the harmonized sales tax hst against election promises and the cancelling of the bc rail corruption trial lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support he would resign in november  and call on the party to elect a new leader in early  christy clark former deputy premier would become leader of the liberal party though she was not currently a sitting mla she would go on to win the seat left vacant by campbell and form a government for the next two years she would attempt to distance herself from the unpopularity of campbell and forge an image for the upcoming election among her early accomplishments she raised the minimum wage created the new holiday of family day and pushed the development of bcs liquified natural gas in the  election the liberals lagged behind the ndp with a doubledigit gap in the polls but were able to come to a surprise victory on election night with a majority making clark the first elected female premier in bc history while clark lost her seat to ndp candidate david eby she later won a byelection in the riding of westsidekelowna her government would go on to balance the budget implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed enbridge northern gateway pipelines then in the  election the ndp would form a minority government with the support from the green party with just a slight edge over the liberal party  in the legislature then on july th the leader of the bc ndp john horgan would officially be sworn in as premier of british columbia with bc green party leader

june   british columbia evolved from british possessions that were established in what is now british columbia by  first nations the original inhabitants of the land have a history of at least  years in the area today there are few treaties and the question of aboriginal title long ignored has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions notably the

is diverse with service producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the provinces gdp it is the endpoint of transcontinental railways and the site of major pacific ports that enable international trade though less than  of its vast  km  sq mi land is arable the province is agriculturally rich particularly in the fraser and okanagan valleys because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction principally logging farming and mining vancouver the provinces largest city and metropolitan area also serves as the headquarters of many westernbased natural resource companies it also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average while the coast of british columbia and certain valleys in the southcentral part of the province have mild weather the majority of its land mass

for the territory drained by the columbia river in southeastern british columbia which was the namesake of the preoregon treaty columbia department of the hudsons bay company queen victoria chose british columbia to distinguish what was the british sector of the columbia district from that of the united states american columbia or southern columbia which became the oregon territory on august   as a result of the treaty ultimately the columbia in the name british columbia is derived from the name of the columbia rediviva an american ship which lent its name to the columbia river and later the wider region the columbia in the name columbia rediviva came from the name columbia for the new world or parts thereof a reference to christopher columbus geographyedit main article geography of british columbia british columbias geography is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief which has defined patterns of settlement and industry since colonization british columbia is bordered by the pacific ocean on the west side by the american state of alaska to the northwest and parts of the west on the north by yukon and the northwest territories on the east by the province of alberta and on the south by the states of washington idaho and montana the current southern border of british columbia was established by the  oregon treaty although its history is tied with lands as far south as california british columbias land area is  square kilometres  sq mi british columbias rugged coastline stretches for more than  kilometres  mi and includes deep mountainous fjords and about  islands most of which are uninhabited it is the only province in canada that borders the pacific ocean british columbias capital is victoria located at the southeastern tip of vancouver island only a narrow strip of the island from campbell river to victoria is significantly populated much of the western part of vancouver island and the rest of the coast is covered by thick tall and sometimes impenetrable temperate rainforest the provinces most populous city is vancouver which is located at the confluence of the fraser river and georgia strait in the southwest corner of the mainland an area often called the lower mainland by land area abbotsford is the largest city vanderhoof is near the geographic centre of the province the coast mountains and the inside passages many inlets provide some of british columbias renowned and spectacular scenery which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and ecotourism industry seventyfive percent of the province is mountainous more than  metres  ft above sea level  is forested and only about  is arable the provinces mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the pacific ocean terrain ranges from dry inland forests and semiarid in numerous valleys to the range and canyon districts of the central and southern interior to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the northern interior the okanagan area extending from near vernon to osoyoos at the united states border is one of several wine and ciderproducing regions in canada other wine regions in british columbia include the cowichan valley on vancouver island and the fraser valley the southern interior cities of kamloops and penticton have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in canada although their temperatures can be exceeded north of the fraser canyon close to the confluence of the fraser and thompson rivers where the terrain is rugged and covered with deserttype flora semidesert grassland is found in large areas of the interior plateau with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones the northern mostly mountainous twothirds of the province are largely unpopulated and undeveloped except for the area east of the rockies where the peace river district in the northeast of the province contains bcs portion of the canadian prairies centred at dawson

warmsummer mediterranean influenced by the north pacific current which has its origins in the kuroshio current due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges the climate of the interior of the province is semiarid with certain locations receiving less than  mm  in annual precipitation the annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to  °c  °f the mildest anywhere in canada the valleys of the southern interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow while those in the cariboo in the central interior are colder because of increased altitude and latitude but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in canada for example the average daily low in prince george roughly located in the middle of the province in january is − °c  °f heavy snowfall occurs in all elevated mountainous terrain providing bases for skiers in both south and central british columbia winters are generally severe in the northern interior but even there milder air can penetrate far inland the coldest temperature in british columbia was recorded in smith river where it dropped to − °c − °f on january   one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in north america atlin in the provinces far northwest along with the adjoining southern lakes region of yukon get midwinter thaws caused by the chinook effect which is also common and much warmer in more southerly parts of the interior during winter on the coast rainfall sometimes relentless heavy rain dominates because of consistent barrages of cyclonic lowpressure systems from the north pacific average snowfall on the coast during an average winter is between  and  cm  and  in but on occasion and not every winter heavy snowfalls with more than  cm  in and well below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas typically for short periods and can take temperatures below − °c  °f even at sea level and arctic outflow winds can make wind chill temperatures at or even below − °c  °f for a couple of mornings while winters are very wet coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer under the influence of stable anticyclonic high pressure southern interior valleys are hot in summer for example in osoyoos the july maximum temperature averages  °c  °f the hottest month of any place in canada this hot weather sometimes spreads towards the coast or to the far north of the province temperatures often exceed  °c  °f in the lower elevations of valleys in the interior during midsummer with the record high of  °c  °f being held in lytton on july   the okanagan region has a climate suitable to vineyards the extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires from drylightning or manmade causes many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during the winter months in contrast to abundant summer sunshine annual sunshine

indigenous peoples of the northwest plateau and the canadian crown and aboriginal peoples the area that is now known as british columbia is home to first nations groups that have a deep history with a significant percentage of indigenous languages there are more than  first nations in bc prior to contact with nonaboriginal people human history is known from archaeological investigations an oral history of first nations groups and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period the arrival of paleoindians from beringia took place between  and  years ago hunter gatherer families were the main social structure from  to  years ago the nomadic population lived in nonpermanent structures foraging for nuts berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs around  years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary lifestyle these indigenous populations evolved over the next  years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs to the northwest of the province are the peoples of the nadene languages which include the athapaskanspeaking peoples and the tlingit who lived on the islands of southern alaska and northern british columbia the nadene language group is believed to be linked to the yeniseian languages of siberia the dene of the western arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from asia to north america the interior of british columbia was home to the salishan language groups such as the shuswap secwepemc okanagan and athabaskan language groups primarily the dakelh carrier and the tsilhqotin the inlets and valleys of the british columbia coast sheltered large distinctive populations such as the haida kwakwakawakw and nuuchahnulth sustained by the regions abundant salmon and shellfish these peoples developed complex cultures dependent on the western red cedar that included wooden houses seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved potlatch items and totem poles contact with europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from europe that the people had no immunity to the result was a dramatic population collapse culminating in the  smallpox outbreak in victoria that spread throughout the coast european settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of british columbia colonial officials deemed that colonists could make better use of the land than the first nations people and thus the land territory be owned by the colonists to ensure colonists would be able to settle properly and make use of the land natives were relocated onto

samuel black and david thompson—were primarily concerned with extending the fur trade rather than political considerations in  by the third of a series of agreements known as the nootka conventions spain conceded its claims of exclusivity in the pacific this opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers including britain but because of the napoleonic wars there was little british action on its claims in the region until later the establishment of trading posts under the auspices of the north west company and the hudsons bay company hbc effectively established a permanent british presence in the region the columbia district was broadly defined as being south of ° north latitude the southern limit of russian america north of mexicancontrolled california and west of the rocky mountains it was by the angloamerican convention of  under the joint occupancy and use of citizens of the united states and subjects of britain which is to say the fur companies this

three fur trading departments the bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the new caledonia district administered from fort st james the interior south of the thompson river watershed and north of the columbia was organized into the columbia district administered from fort vancouver on the lower columbia river the northeast corner of the province east of the rockies known as the peace river block was attached to the much larger athabasca district headquartered in fort chipewyan in presentday alberta until  these districts were a wholly unorganized area of british north america under the de facto jurisdiction of hbc administrators unlike ruperts land to the north and east however the territory was not a concession to the company rather it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the first nations inhabitants all that was changed with the westward extension of american exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty especially in the southern columbia basin within present day washington and oregon in  the oregon treaty divided the territory along the th parallel to the strait of georgia with the area south of this boundary excluding vancouver island and the gulf islands transferred to sole american sovereignty the colony of vancouver island was created in  with victoria designated as the capital new

trading post managers colony of british columbia –edit main articles colony of british columbia – and richard clement moody with the fraser canyon gold rush in  an influx of americans into new caledonia prompted the colonial office to designate the mainland as the colony of british columbia when news of the fraser canyon gold rush reached london richard clement moody was handpicked by the colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and found a second england on the shores of the pacific lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force he sought men who possessed courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the english gentleman and british officer at the head of the royal engineers columbia detachment moody and his family arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary in british columbia moody wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending miles to the right  left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities  yet fr the background of superb mountains swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbingport moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor later gold rushesedit a series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed the largest being the cariboo gold rush in  forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of farflung boom communities like barkerville and lillooet which sprang up overnight the vancouver island colony was facing financial crises of its own and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in  when the colony of british

been created out of three british north american colonies in  the province of canada nova scotia and new brunswick several factors motivated this agitation including the fear of annexation to the

okanagan forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast which was also the locus of a growing fishery the completion of the railway in  was a huge boost to the provinces economy facilitating the transportation of the regions considerable resources to the east the milltown of granville known as gastown near the mouth of the burrard inlet was selected as the terminus of the railway prompting the incorporation of the city as vancouver in  the completion of the port of vancouver spurred rapid growth and in less than fifty years the city surpassed winnipeg manitoba as the largest in western canada the early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically its settlement and development—were paramount this included expropriation from first nations people of their land control over its resources as well as the ability to trade in some resources such as the fishery establishing a labour force to develop the province was problematic from the start and british columbia was the locus of immigration from europe china and japan the influx of a noncaucasian population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups resulting in agitation much of it successful to restrict the ability of asian people to immigrate to british columbia through the imposition of a head tax this resentment culminated in mob attacks against chinese and japanese immigrants in vancouver in  and  by  almost all chinese immigration had been blocked except for merchants professionals students and investors meanwhile the province continued to grow in

fraser this opened up the north coast and the bulkley valley region to new economic opportunities what had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus

vote in the prohibition of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hardcore drinking that vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war because of pressure from veterans prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the soldier and the working man could enjoy a drink but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by european immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of soldier parties to represent their interests variously named soldierfarmer soldierlabour and farmerlabour parties these formed the basis of the fractured labourpolitical spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties including those who would eventually form the cooperative commonwealth and the early social credit splinter groups internment camp for the japanese canadians during world war ii the advent of prohibition in the united states created new opportunities and many found employment or at least profit in crossborder liquor smuggling much of vancouvers prosperity and opulence in the s results from this pirate economy although growth in forestry fishing and mining continued the end of us prohibition combined with the onset of the great depression plunged the province into economic destitution compounding the already dire local economic situation tens of thousands of men from colder parts of canada swarmed into vancouver creating huge hobo jungles around false creek and the burrard inlet rail yards including the old canadian pacific railway mainline rightofway through the heart of the citys downtown at hastings and carrall increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts an occupation of the main post office at granville and hastings which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of martial law on the docks for almost three years a vancouver contingent for the ontoottawa trek was organized and seized a train which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a gatling gun straddling the tracks at mission the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the depression there were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the s but it was the onset of world war ii which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the depression because of the war effort women entered the workforce as never before british columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the pacific ocean to have close relations with east asia however this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward asian immigrants this was most manifest during the second world war when many people of japanese descent were relocated or interned in the interior of the province coalition and the postwar boomedit the bc regiment dcor marching in new westminster  during world war ii the mainstream bc liberal and bc conservative parties of british columbia united in a formal coalition government under new liberal leader john hart who replaced duff pattullo when the latter failed to win a majority in the  election while the liberals won the most number of seats they actually received fewer votes than the socialist cooperative commonwealth federation ccf pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival conservatives led by royal maitland and was replaced by hart who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five liberal and three conservative ministers the ccf was invited to join the coalition but refused the pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of world war ii was to prevent the ccf which had won a surprise victory in saskatchewan in  from ever coming to power in british columbia the ccfs popular vote was high enough in the  election that they were likely to have won threeway contests and could have formed government however the coalition prevented that by uniting the antisocialist vote in the postwar environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects notably the completion of highway  north of prince george to the peace river block a section called the john hart highway and also public hospital insurance in  the reins of the coalition were taken over by byron ingemar johnson the conservatives had wanted their new leader herbert anscomb to be premier but the liberals in the coalition refused johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in british columbia history  in the  election this victory was attributable to the popularity of his governments spending programmes despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power during his tenure major infrastructures continued to expand such as the agreement with alcan aluminum to build the town of kitimat with an aluminum smelter and the large kemano hydro project johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the  flooding of the fraser valley which was a major blow to that region and to the provinces economy increasing tension between the liberal and conservative coalition partners led the liberal party executive to vote to instruct johnson to terminate the arrangement johnson ended the coalition and dropped his conservative cabinet ministers including deputy premier and finance minister herbert anscomb precipitating the general election of  a referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot similar to a preferential ballot where voters could select second and third choices the intent of the ballot as campaigned for by liberals and conservatives was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the ccf but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties including the ccf voted for the fringe british columbia social credit party socreds who wound up with the largest number of seats in the house  only one seat ahead of the ccf despite the ccf having  of the vote to social credits  the social credit party led by rebel former conservative mla w a c bennett formed a minority government backed by the liberals and conservatives with  and  seats respectively bennett began a series of fiscal reforms preaching a new variety of populism as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development laying the ground for a second election in  in which the new bennett regime secured a majority of seats with  of the vote secure with that majority bennett returned the province to the firstpastthepost system thereafter which is still in use today –sedit with the election of the social credit party british columbia embarked on a phase of rapid economic development bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry mining and energy sectors during these two decades the government nationalized british columbia electric and the british columbia power company as well as smaller electric companies renaming the entity bc hydro west kootenay power and light remained independent of bc hydro being owned and operated by cominco though tied into the regional power grid by the end of the s several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the peace columbia and nechako river watersheds the nechako diversion to kemano was to supply power to the alcan inc aluminum smelter at kitimat and was not part of the provincial power grid but privately owned major transmission deals were concluded most notably the columbia river treaty between canada and the united states the provinces economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector as well as oil and gas development in the provinces northeast the s and s were also marked by development in the provinces transportation infrastructure in  the government established bc ferries as a crown corporation to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system also supported by federal grants as being part of the transcanada highway system that system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges and paving of existing highways and provincial roads vancouver and victoria became cultural centres as poets authors artists musicians as well as dancers actors and haute cuisine chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures with the cultural and entrepreneurial community notably bolstered by many draft dodgers from the united states similarly these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics commentators and creative thinkerscitation needed tourism also began to play an important role in the economy the rise of japan and other pacific economies was a great boost to british columbias economy primarily because of massive exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees politically and socially the s brought a period of significant social ferment the divide between the political left and right which had prevailed in the province since the depression and the rise of the labour movement sharpened as socalled free enterprise parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by social credit—in opposition to the social democratic new democratic party the successor to the cooperative commonwealth federation as the provinces economy blossomed so did labourmanagement tensions tensions emerged also from the counterculture movement of the late s of which vancouver and nanaimo were centres the conflict between hippies and vancouver mayor tom campbell was particularly legendary culminating in the socalled gastown riots of  by the end of the decade with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the status quo rising the bennett governments achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity s and sedit on august   the social credit party was reelected in a general election for what would be bennetts final term in power at the start of the s the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector however bc hydro reported its first loss which was the beginning of the end for bennett and the social credit party the socreds were forced from power in the august  election paving the way for a provincial new democratic party ndp government under dave barrett under barrett the large provincial surplus soon became a deficitcitation needed although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous social credit regime and its two sets of books as wac bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management the brief threeyear thousand days period of ndp governance brought several lasting changes to the province most notably the creation of the agricultural land reserve intended to protect farmland from redevelopment and the insurance corporation of british columbia a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing singlepayer basic automobile insurance perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too farreaching coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the ndp in the  general election social credit under wac bennetts son bill bennett was returned to office under the younger bennetts government  of the provinces land base was transferred from government reserve to management by the ministry of forests reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the premiers office and ndpinstigated social programs were rolled back with thenhuman resources minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy although the newera socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the ndp—notably the creation of the resort municipality of whistler whose special status including sunday drinking then an anomaly in bc also during the miniwac regime a reference to his fathers acronym wac certain moneylosing crownowned assets were privatized in a mass giveaway of shares in the british columbia resources investment corporation bcric with the brick shares soon becoming nearworthless towards the end of his tenure in power bennett oversaw the completion of several megaprojects meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most rightwing parties british columbias social credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy most notable of these was the winning of a worlds fair for vancouver which came in the form of expo  to which was tied the construction of the coquihalla highway and vancouvers skytrain system the coquihalla highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premiers brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal the doman scandal in which the premier and millionaire backer herb doman were investigated for insidertrading and securities fraud nonetheless the socreds were reelected in  under bennett who led the party until  the coquihalla highway the road was one of the legacies of the expo  worlds fair the creation of the toll highway sparked controversy as the province entered a sustained recession bennetts popularity and media image were in decline on april   premier bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government and the lieutenantgovernor henry pybus bellirving was forced to call bennett to government house to resolve the impasse and an election was called for april  while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the executive council no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis campaigning on a platform of moderation bennett won an unexpected majority after several weeks of silence in the aftermath a sitting of the house was finally called and in the speech from the throne the socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed restraint which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign the programme included cuts to motherhood issues of the left including the human rights branch the offices of the ombudsman and rentalsman womens programs environmental and cultural programs while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate british columbia this sparked a backlash with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to  people this became known as the  solidarity crisis from the name of the solidarity coalition a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized consisting of organized labour and community groups with the british columbia federation of labour forming a separate organization of unions operation solidarity under the direction of jack munro thenpresident of the international woodworkers of america iwa the most powerful of the provinces resource unions tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a general strike would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the ndp and the left just as a strike at pacific press ended which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the provinces major papers the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and iwa president jack munro and premier bennett a tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued as among the new laws were those enabling nonunion labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues with companies from alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with unionscale british columbia companies despite the tension bennetts last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with expo and bennett was to end his career by hosting prince charles and lady diana on their visit to open expo  his retirement being announced a social credit convention was scheduled for the whistler resort which came down to a threeway shooting match between bud smith the premiers righthand man but an unelected official social credit party grande dame grace mccarthy and the charismatic but eccentric bill vander zalm bill vander zalm became the new socred leader when smith threw his support to him rather than see mccarthy win and led the party to victory in the election later that year vander zalm was later involved in

expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade despite political turmoil harcourt ended up resigning over bingogate—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings harcourt was not implicated but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside glen clark a former president of the bc federation of labour was chosen the new leader of the ndp which won a second term in  more scandals dogged the party most notably the fast ferry scandal involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in british columbia an allegation never substantiated that the premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to clarks resignation as premier he was succeeded on an interim basis by dan miller who was in turn followed by ujjal dosanjh following a leadership convention in the  general election gordon campbells bc liberals defeated the ndp gaining  out of  total seats in the provincial legislature campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the ndps policies including scrapping the fast ferries project lowering income taxes and the controversial sale of bc rail to cn rail campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for driving under the influence during a vacation in

mla she would go on to win the seat left vacant by campbell and form a government for the next two years she would attempt to distance herself from the unpopularity of campbell and forge an image for the upcoming election among her early accomplishments she raised the minimum wage created the new holiday of family day and pushed the development of bcs liquified natural gas in the  election the liberals lagged behind the ndp with a doubledigit gap in the polls but were able to come to a surprise victory on election night with a majority making clark the first elected female premier in bc history while clark lost her seat to ndp candidate david eby she later won a byelection in the riding of westsidekelowna her government would go on to balance the budget implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed enbridge northern gateway pipelines then in the  election the ndp would form a minority government with the support from the green party with just a

governed by the british columbia new democratic party in a minority supported by the british columbia green party led by premier john horgan who became premier as a result of a noconfidence motion on june   british columbia evolved from british possessions that were established in what is now british columbia by  first nations the original inhabitants of the land have a history of at least  years in the area today there are few treaties and the question of aboriginal title long ignored has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions notably the tsilhqotin nation has established aboriginal title to a portion of their territory as a result of the recent supreme court of canada decision william tsilhqotin nation v british columbia bcs economy is diverse with service producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the provinces gdp it is the endpoint of transcontinental railways and the site of major pacific ports that enable international trade though less than  of its vast  km  sq mi land is arable the province is agriculturally rich particularly in the fraser and okanagan valleys because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction principally logging farming and mining vancouver the provinces largest city and metropolitan area also serves as the headquarters of many westernbased natural resource companies it also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average while the coast of british columbia and certain valleys in the southcentral part of the province have mild weather the majority of its land mass

for the territory drained by the columbia river in southeastern british columbia which was the namesake of the preoregon treaty columbia department of the hudsons bay company queen victoria chose british columbia to distinguish what was the british sector of the columbia district from that of the united states american columbia or southern columbia which became the oregon territory on august   as a result of the treaty ultimately the columbia in the name british columbia is derived from the name of the columbia rediviva an american ship which lent its name to the columbia river and later the wider region the columbia in the name columbia rediviva came from the name columbia for the new world or parts thereof a reference to christopher columbus geographyedit main article geography of british columbia british columbias geography is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief which has defined patterns of settlement and industry since colonization british columbia is bordered by the pacific ocean on the west side by the american state of alaska to the northwest and parts of the west on the north by yukon and the northwest territories on the east by the province of alberta and on the south by the states of washington idaho and montana the current southern border of british columbia was established by the  oregon treaty although its history is tied with lands as far south as california british columbias land area is  square kilometres  sq mi british columbias rugged coastline stretches for more than  kilometres  mi and includes deep mountainous fjords and about  islands most of which are uninhabited it is the only province in canada that borders the pacific ocean british columbias capital is victoria located at the southeastern tip of vancouver island only a narrow strip of the island from campbell river to victoria is significantly populated much of the western part of vancouver island and the rest of the coast is covered by thick tall and sometimes impenetrable temperate rainforest the provinces most populous city is vancouver which is located at the confluence of the fraser river and georgia strait in the southwest corner of the mainland an area often called the lower mainland by land area abbotsford is the largest city vanderhoof is near the geographic centre of the province the coast mountains and the inside passages many inlets provide some of british columbias renowned and spectacular scenery which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and ecotourism industry seventyfive percent of the province is mountainous more than  metres  ft above sea level  is forested and only about  is arable the provinces mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the pacific ocean terrain ranges from dry inland forests and semiarid in numerous valleys to the range and canyon districts of the central and southern interior to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the northern interior the okanagan area extending from near vernon to osoyoos at the united states border is one of several wine and ciderproducing regions in canada other wine regions in british columbia include the cowichan valley on vancouver island and the fraser valley the southern interior cities of kamloops and penticton have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in canada although their temperatures can be exceeded north of the fraser canyon close to the confluence of the fraser and thompson rivers where the terrain is rugged and covered with deserttype flora semidesert grassland is found in large areas of the interior plateau with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones the northern mostly mountainous twothirds of the province are largely unpopulated and undeveloped except for the area east of the rockies where the peace river district in the northeast of the province contains bcs portion of the canadian prairies centred at dawson creek climateedit köppen climate types in british columbia strait of georgia near vancouver coastal southern british columbia has a mild rainy oceanic climate some far southern parts of which are warmsummer mediterranean influenced by the north pacific current which has its origins in the kuroshio current due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges the climate of the interior of the province is semiarid with certain locations receiving less than  mm  in annual precipitation the annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to  °c  °f the mildest anywhere in canada the valleys of the southern interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow while those in the cariboo in the central interior are colder because of increased altitude and latitude but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in canada for example the average daily low in prince george roughly located in the middle of the province in january is − °c  °f heavy snowfall occurs in all elevated mountainous terrain providing bases for skiers in both south and central british columbia winters are generally severe in the northern interior but even there milder air can penetrate far inland the coldest temperature in british columbia was recorded in smith river where it dropped to − °c − °f on january   one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in north america atlin in the provinces far northwest along with the adjoining southern lakes region of yukon get midwinter thaws caused by the chinook effect which is also common and much warmer in more southerly parts of the interior during winter on the coast rainfall sometimes relentless heavy rain dominates because of consistent barrages of cyclonic lowpressure systems from the north pacific average snowfall on the coast during an average winter is between  and  cm  and  in but on occasion and not every winter heavy snowfalls with more than  cm  in and well below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas typically for short periods and can take temperatures below − °c  °f even at sea level and arctic outflow winds can make wind chill temperatures at or even below − °c  °f for a couple of mornings while winters are very wet coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer under the influence of stable anticyclonic high pressure southern interior valleys are hot in summer for example in osoyoos the july maximum temperature averages  °c  °f the hottest month of any place in canada this hot weather sometimes spreads towards the coast or to the far north of the province temperatures often exceed  °c  °f in the lower elevations of valleys in the interior during midsummer with the record high of  °c  °f being held in lytton on july   the okanagan region has a climate suitable to vineyards the extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires from drylightning or manmade causes many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during the winter months in contrast to abundant summer sunshine annual sunshine

cordillera taiga plains boreal plains ecozones historyedit main article history of british columbia first nations aboriginal historyedit main articles indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast indigenous peoples of the northwest plateau and the canadian crown and aboriginal peoples the area that is now known as british columbia is home to first nations groups that have a deep history with a significant percentage of indigenous languages there are more than  first nations in bc prior to contact with nonaboriginal people human history is known from archaeological investigations an oral history of first nations groups and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period the arrival of paleoindians from beringia took place between  and  years ago hunter gatherer families were the main social structure from  to  years ago the nomadic population lived in nonpermanent structures foraging for nuts berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs around  years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary lifestyle these indigenous populations evolved over the next  years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs to the northwest of the province are the peoples of the nadene languages which include the athapaskanspeaking peoples and the tlingit who lived on the islands of southern alaska and northern british columbia the nadene language group is believed to be linked to the yeniseian languages of siberia the dene of the western arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from asia to north america the interior of british columbia was home to the salishan language groups such as the shuswap secwepemc okanagan and athabaskan language groups primarily the dakelh carrier and the tsilhqotin the inlets and valleys of the british columbia coast sheltered large distinctive populations such as the haida kwakwakawakw and nuuchahnulth sustained by the regions abundant salmon and shellfish these peoples developed complex cultures dependent on the western red cedar that included wooden houses seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved potlatch items and totem poles contact with europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from europe that the people had no immunity to the result was a dramatic population collapse culminating in the  smallpox outbreak in victoria that spread throughout the coast european settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of british columbia colonial officials deemed that colonists could make better use of the land than the first nations people and thus the land territory be owned by the colonists to ensure colonists would be able to settle properly and make use of the land natives were relocated onto reserves which were often too small to support their way of life by the s over  reserves were located within british columbia fur trade and colonial eraedit the british during the colonial period spread across the world claiming territories and building the british empire lands now known as british columbia were added to the empire during the th century originally established under the auspices of the hudsons bay company colonies were established vancouver island the mainland that were amalgamated then entered confederation as british columbia in  as part of the dominion of canada

spanish fort san miguel at nootka in  kwakwakawakw house pole second half of the th century the arrival of europeans began around the midth century as fur traders entered the area to harvest sea otters while it is thought that sir francis drake may have explored the british columbian coast in  it was juan pérez who completed the first documented voyage which took place in  juan francisco de la bodega y quadra explored the coast in  in doing so pérez and quadra reasserted the spanish claim for the pacific coast first made by vasco núñez de balboa in  the explorations of james cook in  and george vancouver in – established british jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the columbia river in  sir alexander mackenzie was the first european to journey across north america overland to the pacific ocean inscribing a stone marking his accomplishment on the shoreline of dean channel near bella coola his expedition theoretically established british sovereignty inland and a succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the canadian prairies and the pacific mackenzie and other explorers—notably john finlay simon fraser samuel black and david thompson—were primarily concerned with extending the fur trade rather than political considerations in  by the third of a series of agreements known as the nootka conventions spain conceded its claims of exclusivity in the pacific this opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers including britain but because of the napoleonic wars there was little british action on its claims in the region until later the establishment of trading posts under the auspices of the north west company and the hudsons bay company hbc effectively established a permanent british presence in the region the columbia district was broadly defined as being south of ° north latitude the southern limit of russian america north of mexicancontrolled california and west of the rocky mountains it was by the angloamerican convention of  under the joint occupancy and use of citizens of the united states and subjects of britain which is to say the fur companies this cooccupancy was ended with the oregon treaty of  the major supply route was the york factory express between hudson bay and fort vancouver some of the early outposts grew into settlements communities and cities among the places in british columbia that began as fur trading posts are fort st john established  hudsons hope  fort nelson  fort st james  prince george  kamloops  fort langley  fort victoria  yale  and nanaimo  fur company posts that became cities in what is now the united states include vancouver washington fort vancouver formerly the capital of hudsons bay operations in the columbia district colville washington and walla walla washington old fort nez percés with the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in  the region now comprising british columbia existed in three fur trading departments the bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the new caledonia district administered from fort st james the interior south of the thompson river watershed and north of the columbia was organized into the columbia district administered from fort vancouver on the lower columbia river the northeast corner of the province east of the rockies known as the peace river block was attached to the much larger athabasca district headquartered in fort chipewyan in presentday alberta until  these districts were a wholly unorganized area of british north america under the de facto jurisdiction of hbc administrators unlike ruperts land to the north and east however the territory was not a concession to the company rather it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the first nations inhabitants all that was changed with the westward extension of american exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty especially in the southern columbia basin within present day washington and oregon in  the oregon treaty divided the territory along the th parallel to the strait of georgia with the area south of

caledonia prompted the colonial office to designate the mainland as the colony of british columbia when news of the fraser canyon gold rush reached london richard clement moody was handpicked by the colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and found a second england on the shores of the pacific lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force he sought men who possessed courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the english gentleman and british officer at the head of the royal engineers columbia detachment moody and his family arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary in british columbia moody wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending miles to the right  left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities  yet fr the background of superb mountains swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbingport moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor later gold rushesedit a series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed the largest being the cariboo gold rush in  forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of farflung boom communities like barkerville and lillooet which sprang up overnight the vancouver island colony was facing financial crises of its own and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in  when the colony of british columbia was amalgamated with the colony of vancouver island to form the colony of british columbia – which was in turn succeeded by the present day province of british columbia following the canadian

condition of entry into confederation the confederation league including such figures as amor de cosmos john robson and robert beaven led the chorus pressing for the colony to join canada which had been created out of three british north american colonies in  the province of canada nova scotia and new brunswick several factors motivated this agitation including the fear of annexation to the united states the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth the need for governmentfunded services to support this population and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush memorial last spike in craigellachie with the agreement by the canadian government to extend the canadian pacific railway to british columbia and to assume the colonys debt british columbia became the sixth province to join confederation on july   the borders of the province were not completely settled the treaty of washington sent the pig war san juan islands border dispute to arbitration in  and in  the provinces territory shrank again after the alaska boundary dispute settled the vague boundary of the alaska panhandle population in british columbia continued to expand as the provinces mining forestry agriculture and fishing sectors were developed mining activity was particularly notable throughout the mainland particularly in the boundary country in the slocan in the west kootenay around trail the east kootenay the southeast corner of the province the fraser canyon the cariboo the omineca and the cassiar so much so a common epithet for the mainland even after provincehood was the gold colony agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile fraser valley and cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the thompson river area the cariboo the chilcotin and the okanagan forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast which was also the locus of a growing fishery the completion of the railway in  was a huge boost to the provinces economy facilitating the transportation of the regions considerable resources to the east the milltown of granville known as gastown near the mouth of the burrard inlet was selected as the terminus of the railway prompting the incorporation of the city as vancouver in  the completion of the port of vancouver spurred rapid growth and in less than fifty years the city surpassed winnipeg manitoba as the largest in western canada the early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically its settlement and development—were paramount this included expropriation from first nations people of their land control over its resources as well as the ability to trade in some resources such as the fishery establishing a labour force to develop the province was problematic from the start and british columbia was the locus of immigration from europe china and japan the influx of a noncaucasian population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups resulting in agitation much of it successful to restrict the ability of asian people to immigrate to british columbia through the imposition of a head tax this resentment culminated in mob attacks against chinese and japanese immigrants in vancouver in  and  by  almost all chinese immigration had been blocked except for merchants professionals students and investors meanwhile the province continued to grow in  the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line the grand trunk pacific linking northcentral british columbia from the yellowhead pass through prince george to prince rupert was driven at fort fraser this opened up the north coast and the bulkley valley region to new economic opportunities what had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus for forestry farming and mining in world war i the province responded strongly to the call to assist the british empire against its german foes in french and belgian battlefields about  of the  british columbian residents the highest percapita rate in canada responded to the military needs horseriders from the provinces interior region and first nations soldiers made contributions to vimy ridge and other battles about  men from the province died in combat s through sedit when the men returned from world war i they discovered the recently enfranchised women of the province had helped vote in the prohibition of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hardcore drinking that vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war because of pressure from veterans prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the soldier and the working man could enjoy a drink but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by european immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of soldier parties to represent their interests variously named soldierfarmer soldierlabour and farmerlabour parties these formed the basis of the fractured labourpolitical spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties including those who would eventually form the cooperative commonwealth and the early social credit splinter groups internment camp for the japanese canadians during world war ii the advent of prohibition in the united states created new opportunities and many found employment or at least profit in crossborder liquor smuggling much of vancouvers prosperity and opulence in the s results from this pirate economy although growth in forestry fishing and mining continued the end of us prohibition combined with the onset of the great depression plunged the province into economic destitution compounding the already dire local economic situation tens of thousands of men from colder parts of canada swarmed into vancouver creating huge hobo jungles around false creek and the burrard inlet rail yards including the old canadian pacific railway mainline rightofway through the heart of the citys downtown at hastings and carrall increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts an occupation of the main post office at granville and hastings which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of martial law on the docks for almost three years a vancouver contingent for the ontoottawa trek was organized and seized a train which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a gatling gun straddling the tracks at mission the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the depression there were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the s but it was the onset of world war ii which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the depression because of the war effort women entered the workforce as never before british columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the pacific ocean to have close relations with east asia however this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward asian immigrants this was most manifest during the second world war when many people of japanese descent were relocated or interned in the interior of the province coalition and the postwar boomedit the bc regiment dcor marching in new westminster  during world war ii the mainstream bc liberal and bc conservative parties of british columbia united in a formal coalition government under new liberal leader john hart who replaced duff pattullo when the latter failed to win a majority in the  election while the liberals won the most number of seats they actually received fewer votes than the socialist cooperative commonwealth federation ccf pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival conservatives led by royal maitland and was replaced by hart who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five liberal and three conservative ministers the ccf was invited to join the coalition but refused the pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of world war ii was to prevent the ccf which had won a surprise victory in saskatchewan in  from ever coming to power in british columbia the ccfs popular vote was high enough in the  election that they were likely to have won threeway contests and could have formed government however the coalition prevented that by uniting the antisocialist vote in the postwar environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects notably the completion of highway  north of prince george to the peace river block a section called the john hart highway and also public hospital insurance in  the reins of the coalition were taken over by byron ingemar johnson the conservatives had wanted their new leader herbert anscomb to be premier but the liberals in the coalition refused johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in british columbia history  in the  election this victory was attributable to the popularity of his governments spending programmes despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power during his tenure major infrastructures continued to expand such as the agreement with alcan aluminum to build the town of kitimat with an aluminum smelter and the large kemano hydro project johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the  flooding of the fraser valley which was a major blow to that region and to the provinces economy increasing tension between the liberal and conservative coalition partners led the liberal party executive to vote to instruct johnson to terminate the arrangement johnson ended the coalition and dropped his conservative cabinet ministers including deputy premier and finance minister herbert anscomb precipitating the general election of  a referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot similar to a preferential ballot where voters could select second and third choices the intent of the ballot as campaigned for by liberals and conservatives was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the ccf but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties including the ccf voted for the fringe british columbia social credit party socreds who wound up with the largest number of seats in the house  only one seat ahead of the ccf despite the ccf having  of the vote to social credits  the social credit party led by rebel former conservative mla w a c bennett formed a minority government backed by the liberals and conservatives with  and  seats respectively bennett began a series of fiscal reforms preaching a new variety of populism as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development laying the ground for a second election in  in which the new bennett regime secured a majority of seats with  of the vote secure with that majority bennett returned the province to the firstpastthepost system thereafter which is still in use today –sedit with the election of the social credit party british columbia embarked on a phase of rapid economic development bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry mining and energy sectors during these two decades the government nationalized british columbia electric and the british columbia power company as well as smaller electric companies renaming the entity bc hydro west kootenay power and light remained independent of bc hydro being owned and operated by cominco though tied into the regional power grid by the end of the s several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the peace columbia and nechako river watersheds the nechako diversion to kemano was to supply power to the alcan inc aluminum smelter at kitimat and was not part of the provincial power grid but privately owned major transmission deals were concluded most notably the columbia river treaty between canada and the united states the provinces economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector as well as oil and gas development in the provinces northeast the s and s were also marked by development in the provinces transportation infrastructure in  the government established bc ferries as a crown corporation to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system also supported by federal grants as being part of the transcanada highway system that system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges and paving of existing highways and provincial roads vancouver and victoria became cultural centres as poets authors artists musicians as well as dancers actors and haute cuisine chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures with the cultural and entrepreneurial community notably bolstered by many draft dodgers from the united states similarly these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics commentators and creative thinkerscitation needed tourism also began to play an important role in the economy the rise of japan and other pacific economies was a great boost to british columbias economy primarily because of massive exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees politically and socially the s brought a period of significant social ferment the divide between the political left and right which had prevailed in the province since the depression and the rise of the labour movement sharpened as socalled free enterprise parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by social credit—in opposition to the social democratic new democratic party the successor to the cooperative commonwealth federation as the provinces economy blossomed so did labourmanagement tensions tensions emerged also from the counterculture movement of the late s of which vancouver and nanaimo were centres the conflict between hippies and vancouver mayor tom campbell was particularly legendary culminating in the socalled gastown riots of  by the end of the decade with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the status quo rising the bennett governments achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity s and sedit on august   the social credit party was reelected in a general election for what would be bennetts final term in power at the start of the s the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector however bc hydro reported its first loss which was the beginning of the end for bennett and the social credit party the socreds were forced from power in the august  election paving the way for a provincial new democratic party ndp government under dave barrett under barrett the large provincial surplus soon became a deficitcitation needed although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous social credit regime and its two sets of books as wac bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management the brief threeyear thousand days period of ndp governance brought several lasting changes to the province most notably the creation of the agricultural land reserve intended to protect farmland from redevelopment and the insurance corporation of british columbia a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing singlepayer basic automobile insurance perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too farreaching coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the ndp in the  general election social credit under wac bennetts son bill bennett was returned to office under the younger bennetts government  of the provinces land base was transferred from government reserve to management by the ministry of forests reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the premiers office and ndpinstigated social programs were rolled back with thenhuman resources minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy although the newera socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the ndp—notably the creation of the resort municipality of whistler whose special status including sunday drinking then an anomaly in bc also during the miniwac regime a reference to his fathers acronym wac certain moneylosing crownowned assets were privatized in a mass giveaway of shares in the british columbia resources investment corporation bcric with the brick shares soon becoming nearworthless towards the end of his tenure in power bennett oversaw the completion of several megaprojects meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most rightwing parties british columbias social credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy most notable of these was the winning of a worlds fair for vancouver which came in the form of expo  to which was tied the construction of the coquihalla highway and vancouvers skytrain system the coquihalla highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premiers brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal the doman scandal in which the premier and millionaire backer herb doman were investigated for insidertrading and securities fraud nonetheless the socreds were reelected in  under bennett who led the party until  the coquihalla highway the road was one of the legacies of the expo  worlds fair the creation of the toll highway sparked controversy as the province entered a sustained recession bennetts popularity and media image were in decline on april   premier bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government and the lieutenantgovernor henry pybus bellirving was forced to call bennett to government house to resolve the impasse and an election was called for april  while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the executive council no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis campaigning on a platform of moderation bennett won an unexpected majority after several weeks of silence in the aftermath a sitting of the house was finally called and in the speech from the throne the socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed restraint which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign the programme included cuts to motherhood issues of the left including the human rights branch the offices of the ombudsman and rentalsman womens programs environmental and cultural programs while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate british columbia this sparked a backlash with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to  people this became known as the  solidarity crisis from the name of the solidarity coalition a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized consisting of organized labour and community groups with the british columbia federation of labour forming a separate organization of unions operation solidarity under the direction of jack munro thenpresident of the international woodworkers of america iwa the most powerful of the provinces resource unions tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a general strike would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the ndp and the left just as a strike at pacific press ended which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the provinces major papers the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and iwa president jack munro and premier bennett a tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued as among the new laws were those enabling nonunion labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues with companies from alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with unionscale british columbia companies despite the tension bennetts last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with expo and bennett was to end his career by hosting prince charles and lady diana on their visit to open expo  his retirement being announced a social credit convention was scheduled for the whistler resort which came down to a threeway shooting match between bud smith the premiers righthand man but an unelected official social credit party grande dame grace mccarthy and the charismatic but eccentric bill vander zalm bill vander zalm became the new socred leader when smith threw his support to him rather than see mccarthy win and led the party to victory in the election later that year vander zalm was later involved in a conflict of interest scandal following the sale of fantasy gardens a christian and dutch culture theme park built by the premier to tan yu a filipino chinese gambling kingpin there were also concerns over yus application to the government for a bank licence and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor faye leung of a party in the howard hughes suite on the top two floors of the bayshore inn where tan yu had been staying with reports of a bag of money in a brown paper bag passed from yu to vander zalm during the goingson these scandals forced vander zalms resignation and rita johnston became premier of the province johnston presided over the end of social credit power calling an election which led to the reducing of the partys caucus to only two seats and the revival of the longdefunct british columbia liberal party as opposition to the victorious ndp under former vancouver mayor mike harcourt in  david lam was appointed as british columbia’s twentyfifth lieutenantgovernor and was the provinces first lieutenantgovernor of chinese origin s to presentedit this article needs to be updated please update this section to reflect recent events or newly available information august  johnston lost the  general election to the ndp under the leadership of mike harcourt a former mayor of vancouver the ndps unprecedented creation of new parkland and protected areas was popular and helped boost the provinces growing tourism sector however the economy continued to struggle against the backdrop of a weak resource economy housing starts and an expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade despite political turmoil harcourt ended up resigning over bingogate—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings harcourt was not implicated but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside glen clark a former president of the bc federation of labour was chosen the new leader of the ndp which won a second term in  more scandals dogged the party most notably the fast ferry scandal involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in british columbia an allegation never substantiated that the premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to clarks resignation as premier he was succeeded on an interim basis by dan miller who was in turn followed by ujjal dosanjh following a leadership convention in the  general election gordon campbells bc liberals defeated the ndp gaining  out of  total seats in the provincial legislature campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the ndps policies including scrapping the fast ferries project lowering income taxes and the controversial sale of bc rail to cn rail campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for driving under the influence during a vacation in hawaii however campbell still managed to lead his party to victory in the  general election against a substantially strengthened ndp opposition campbell won a third term in the british columbia general election  marking the first time in  years that a premier has been elected to a third term the province won a bid to host the  winter olympics in vancouver and whistler as promised in his  reelection campaign vancouver mayor larry campbell staged a nonbinding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the olympics in february  vancouvers residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid sixtyfour percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games after the olympic joy had faded campbells popularity started to fall his management style the implementation of the harmonized sales tax hst against election promises and the cancelling of the bc rail corruption trial lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support he would resign in november  and call on the party to elect a new leader in early  christy clark former deputy premier would become leader of the liberal party though she was not currently a sitting mla she would go on to win the seat left vacant by campbell and form a government for the next two years she would attempt to distance herself from the unpopularity of campbell and forge an image for the upcoming election among her early accomplishments she raised the minimum wage created the new holiday of family day and pushed the development of bcs liquified natural gas in the  election the liberals lagged behind the ndp with a doubledigit gap in the polls but were able to come to a surprise victory on election night with a majority making clark the first elected female premier in bc history while clark lost her seat to ndp candidate david eby she later won a byelection in the riding of westsidekelowna her government would go on to balance the budget implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed enbridge northern gateway pipelines then in the  election the ndp would form a minority government with the support from the green party with just a slight edge over the liberal party  in the legislature then on july th the leader of the bc ndp john horgan would officially be sworn in as premier of british columbia with bc green party leader andrew weaver by his side british columbia has also been significantly affected by demographic changes within canada and around the world vancouver and to a lesser extent some other parts of british columbia was a major destination for many of the immigrants from hong kong who left the former uk colony either temporarily or permanently in the years immediately prior to its handover to the peoples republic of china british columbia has also been a significant destination for internal canadian migrants this has been the case throughout recent decades because of its image of natural beauty mild climate and relaxed lifestyle but is particularly true during periods of economic growth as a result british columbia has moved from approximately  of canadas population in  to approximately  in

ministers for various portfolios what are officially part of the executive council of british columbia cabinet of whom the premier is chair the province is currently governed by the british columbia new democratic party bc ndp under premierdesignate john horgan the  provincial election saw the liberal party take  seats the ndp take  and the british columbia green party take  no party met the minimum of  seats for a majority therefore leading to the first minority government since  following the election the greens entered into negotiations with both the liberals and ndp eventually announcing that they would support the current ndp minority previously the rightofcentre british columbia liberal party governed the province for sixteen years between  and  and won the largest landslide election in british columbia history in  with  of  seats the legislature became more evenly divided however between the liberals and ndp following the   liberal seats of  and   liberal seats of  provincial elections the ndp and its predecessor the ccf have been the main opposition force to rightwing parties since the s and have ruled with majority governments in – and – the green party plays a larger role in the politics of british columbia than green parties do in most other jurisdictions in canada after a breakthrough election in   the partys vote share declined  –   –     before increasing again to a record high of  at the  election the british columbia liberal party is not related to the federal liberal party and does not share the same ideology instead the bc liberal party

ferries the meeting chamber of the provincial legislative assembly british columbia is known for having politically active labour unions who have traditionally supported the ndp or its predecessor the ccf british columbias political history is typified by scandal and a cast of colourful characters beginning with various colonialera land scandals and abuses of power by early officials such as those that led to mcgowans war in – notable scandals in social credit years included the robert bonner affair and the fantasy gardens scandal which forced premier bill vander zalm to resign and ended the social credit era ndp scandals included bingogate which brought down ndp premier mike harcourt and the alleged scandal named casinogate which drove ndp premier glen clark to resign a variety of

appointments to be made based on the recommendations of a new advisory board that would use nonpartisan criteria hours after that plan was unveiled in ottawa on december   clark issued a statement that it did not address what’s been wrong with the senate since the beginning the imbalance in representation in that house is apparent when considering population size the six senators from bc constitute only one for every  people vs one for every  in pei which has four senators nova scotia and new brunswick have much smaller populations than bc yet each has ten senators according to a

mainland and central interior of the province much of the rest of the province where traffic volumes are generally low is accessible by wellmaintained generally highmobility twolane arterial highways with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas and usually only a few stopcontrolled intersections outside the main urban areas a couple of busy intercity corridors outside greater vancouver feature more heavily signalized limitedmobility arterial highways that are mostly fourlane and often divided by portable median traffic barriers highway  on vancouver island and highway  through the okanagan valley are medium to highvolume roadways with variable posted speeds that range from  kmh to maximums just slightly lower than the principal gradeseparated highways numerous traffic lights operate in place of interchanges on both arterials as longterm costcutting measures signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along interurban sections where traffic volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of highmobility alternative routes or bypasses the building and maintenance of provincial highways is the responsibility of the british columbia ministry of transportation and infrastructure there are only five major routes to the rest of canada from

for the territory drained by the columbia river in southeastern british columbia which was the namesake of the preoregon treaty columbia department of the hudsons bay company queen victoria chose british columbia to distinguish what was the british sector of the columbia district from that of the united states american columbia or southern columbia which became the oregon territory on august   as a result of the treaty ultimately the columbia in the name british columbia is derived from the name of the columbia rediviva an american ship which lent its name to the columbia river and later

british columbia british columbias geography is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief which has defined patterns of settlement and industry since colonization british columbia is bordered by the pacific ocean on the west side by the american state of alaska to the northwest and parts of the west on the north by yukon and the northwest territories on the east by the province of alberta and on the south by the states of washington idaho and montana the current southern border of british columbia was established by the  oregon treaty although its history is tied with lands as far south as california british columbias land area is  square kilometres  sq mi british columbias rugged coastline stretches for more than  kilometres  mi and includes deep mountainous fjords and about  islands most of which are uninhabited it is the only province in canada that borders the pacific ocean british columbias capital is victoria located at the southeastern tip of vancouver island only a narrow strip of the island from campbell river to victoria is significantly populated much of the western part of vancouver island and the rest of the coast is covered by thick tall and sometimes impenetrable temperate rainforest the provinces most populous city is vancouver which is located at the confluence of the fraser river and georgia strait in the southwest corner of the mainland an area often called the lower mainland by land area abbotsford is the largest city vanderhoof is near the geographic centre of the province the coast mountains and the inside passages many inlets provide some of british columbias renowned and spectacular scenery which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and ecotourism industry seventyfive percent of the province is mountainous more than  metres  ft above sea level  is forested and only about  is arable the provinces mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the pacific ocean terrain ranges from dry inland forests and semiarid in numerous valleys to the range and canyon districts of the central and southern interior to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the northern interior the okanagan area extending from near vernon to osoyoos at the united states border is one of several wine and ciderproducing regions in canada other wine regions in british columbia include the cowichan valley on vancouver island and the fraser valley the southern interior cities of kamloops and penticton have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in canada although their temperatures can be exceeded north of the fraser canyon close to the confluence of the fraser and thompson rivers where the terrain is rugged and covered with deserttype flora semidesert grassland is

indigenous peoples of the northwest plateau and the canadian crown and aboriginal peoples the area that is now known as british columbia is home to first nations groups that have a deep history with a significant percentage of indigenous languages there are more than  first nations in bc prior to contact with nonaboriginal people human history is known from archaeological investigations an oral history of first nations groups and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period the arrival of paleoindians from beringia took place between  and  years ago hunter gatherer families were the main social structure from  to  years ago the nomadic population lived in nonpermanent structures foraging for nuts berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs around  years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary lifestyle these indigenous populations evolved over the next  years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs to the northwest of the province are the peoples of the nadene languages which include the athapaskanspeaking peoples and the tlingit who lived on the islands of southern alaska and northern british columbia the nadene language group is believed to be linked to the yeniseian languages of siberia the dene of the western arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from asia to north america the interior of british columbia was home to the salishan language groups such as the shuswap secwepemc okanagan and athabaskan language groups primarily the dakelh carrier and the tsilhqotin the inlets and valleys of the british columbia coast sheltered large distinctive populations such as the haida kwakwakawakw and nuuchahnulth sustained by the regions abundant salmon and shellfish these peoples developed complex cultures dependent on the western red cedar that included wooden houses seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved potlatch items and totem poles contact with europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from europe that the people had no immunity to the result was a dramatic population collapse culminating in the  smallpox outbreak in victoria that spread throughout the coast european settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of british columbia colonial officials deemed that colonists could make better use of the land than the first nations people and thus the land territory be owned by the colonists to ensure colonists would be able to settle properly and make use of the land natives were relocated onto

samuel black and david thompson—were primarily concerned with extending the fur trade rather than political considerations in  by the third of a series of agreements known as the nootka conventions spain conceded its claims of exclusivity in the pacific this opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers including britain but because of the napoleonic wars there was little british action on its claims in the region until later the establishment of trading posts under the auspices of the north west company and the hudsons bay company hbc effectively established a permanent british presence in the region the columbia district was broadly defined as being south of ° north latitude the southern limit of russian america north of mexicancontrolled california and west of the rocky mountains it was by the angloamerican convention of  under the joint occupancy and use of citizens of the united states and subjects of britain which is to say the fur companies this cooccupancy was ended with the oregon treaty of  the major supply route was the york factory express between hudson bay and fort vancouver some of the early outposts grew into settlements communities

three fur trading departments the bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the new caledonia district administered from fort st james the interior south of the thompson river watershed and north of the columbia was organized into the columbia district administered from fort vancouver on the lower columbia river the northeast corner of the province east of the rockies known as the peace river block was attached to the much larger athabasca district headquartered in fort chipewyan in presentday alberta until  these districts were a wholly unorganized area of british north america under the de facto jurisdiction of hbc administrators unlike ruperts land to the north and east however the territory was not a concession to the company rather it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the first nations inhabitants all that was changed with the westward extension of american exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty especially in the southern columbia basin within present day washington and oregon in  the oregon treaty divided the territory along the th parallel to the strait of georgia with the area south of this boundary excluding vancouver island and the gulf islands transferred to sole american sovereignty the colony of vancouver island was created in  with victoria designated as the capital new

colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and found a second england on the shores of the pacific lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force he sought men who possessed courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the english gentleman and british officer at the head of the royal engineers columbia detachment moody and his family arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary in british columbia moody wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending

sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbingport moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor later gold rushesedit a series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed the largest being the cariboo gold rush in  forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of farflung boom communities like barkerville and lillooet which sprang up overnight the vancouver island colony was facing financial crises of its own and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in  when the colony of british

okanagan forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast which was also the locus of a growing fishery the completion of the railway in  was a huge boost to the provinces economy facilitating the transportation of the regions considerable resources to the east the milltown of granville known as gastown near the mouth of the burrard inlet was selected as the terminus of the railway prompting the incorporation of the city as vancouver in  the completion of the port of vancouver spurred rapid growth and in less than fifty years the city surpassed winnipeg manitoba as the largest in western canada the early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically its settlement and development—were paramount this included expropriation from first nations people of their land control over its resources as well as the ability to trade in some resources such as the fishery establishing a labour force to develop the province was problematic from the start and british columbia was the locus of immigration from europe china and japan the influx of a noncaucasian population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups resulting in agitation much of it successful to restrict the ability of asian people to immigrate to british columbia through the imposition of a head tax this resentment culminated in mob attacks against chinese and japanese immigrants in vancouver in  and  by  almost all chinese immigration had been blocked except for merchants professionals students and investors meanwhile the province continued to grow in

vote in the prohibition of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hardcore drinking that vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war because of pressure from veterans prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the soldier and the working man could enjoy a drink but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by european immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of soldier parties to represent their interests variously named soldierfarmer soldierlabour and farmerlabour parties these formed the basis of the fractured labourpolitical spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties including those who would eventually form the cooperative commonwealth and the early social credit splinter groups internment camp for the japanese canadians during world war ii the advent of prohibition in the united states created new opportunities and many found employment or at least profit in crossborder liquor smuggling much of vancouvers prosperity and opulence in the s results from this pirate economy although growth in forestry fishing and mining continued the end of us prohibition combined with the onset of the great depression plunged the province into economic destitution compounding the already dire local economic situation tens of thousands of men from colder parts of canada swarmed into vancouver creating huge hobo jungles around false creek and the burrard inlet rail yards including the old canadian pacific railway mainline rightofway through the heart of the citys downtown at hastings and carrall increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts an occupation of the main post office at granville and hastings which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of martial law on the docks for almost three years a vancouver contingent for the ontoottawa trek was organized and seized a train which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a gatling gun straddling the tracks at mission the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the depression there were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the s but it was the onset of world war ii which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the depression because of the war effort women entered the workforce as never before british columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the pacific ocean to have close relations with east asia however this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward asian immigrants this was most manifest during the second world war when many people of japanese descent were relocated or interned in the interior of the province coalition and the postwar boomedit the bc regiment dcor marching in new westminster  during world war ii the mainstream bc liberal and bc conservative parties of british columbia united in a formal coalition government under new liberal leader john hart who replaced duff pattullo when the latter failed to win a majority in the  election while the liberals won the most number of seats they actually received fewer votes than the socialist cooperative commonwealth federation ccf pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival conservatives led by royal maitland and was replaced by hart who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five liberal and three conservative ministers the ccf was invited to join the coalition but refused the pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of world war ii was to prevent the ccf which had won a surprise victory in saskatchewan in  from ever coming to power in british columbia the ccfs popular vote was high enough in the  election that they were likely to have won threeway contests and could have formed government however the coalition prevented that by uniting the antisocialist vote in the postwar environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects notably the completion of highway  north of prince george to the peace river block a section called the john hart highway and also public hospital insurance in  the reins of the coalition were taken over by byron ingemar johnson the conservatives had wanted their new leader herbert anscomb to be premier but the liberals in the coalition refused johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in british columbia history  in the  election this victory was attributable to the popularity of his governments spending programmes despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power during his tenure major infrastructures continued to expand such as the agreement with alcan aluminum to build the town of kitimat with an aluminum smelter and the large kemano hydro project johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the  flooding of the fraser valley which was a major blow to that region and to the provinces economy increasing tension between the liberal and conservative coalition partners led the liberal party executive to vote to instruct johnson to terminate the arrangement johnson ended the coalition and dropped his conservative cabinet ministers including deputy premier and finance minister herbert anscomb precipitating the general election of  a referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot similar to a preferential ballot where voters could select second and third choices the intent of the ballot as campaigned for by liberals and conservatives was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the ccf but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties including the ccf voted for the fringe british columbia social credit party socreds who wound up with the largest number of seats in the house  only one seat ahead of the ccf despite the ccf having  of the vote to social credits  the social credit party led by rebel former conservative mla w a c bennett formed a minority government backed by the liberals and conservatives with  and  seats respectively bennett began a series of fiscal reforms preaching a new variety of populism as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development laying the ground for a second election in  in which the new bennett regime secured a majority of seats with  of the vote secure with that majority bennett returned the province to the firstpastthepost system thereafter which is still in use today –sedit with the election of the social credit party british columbia embarked on a phase of rapid economic development bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry mining and energy sectors during these two decades the government nationalized british columbia electric and the british columbia power company as well as smaller electric companies renaming the entity bc hydro west kootenay power and light remained independent of bc hydro being owned and operated by cominco though tied into the regional power grid by the end of the s several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the peace columbia and nechako river watersheds the nechako diversion to kemano was to supply power to the alcan inc aluminum smelter at kitimat and was not part of the provincial power grid but privately owned major transmission deals were concluded most notably the columbia river treaty between canada and the united states the provinces economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector as well as oil and gas development in the provinces northeast the s and s were also marked by development in the provinces transportation infrastructure in  the government established bc ferries as a crown corporation to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system also supported by federal grants as being part of the transcanada highway system that system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges and paving of existing highways and provincial roads vancouver and victoria became cultural centres as poets authors artists musicians as well as dancers actors and haute cuisine chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures with the cultural and entrepreneurial community notably bolstered by many draft dodgers from the united states similarly these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics commentators and creative thinkerscitation needed tourism also began to play an important role in the economy the rise of japan and other pacific economies was a great boost to british columbias economy primarily because of massive exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees politically and socially the s brought a period of significant social ferment the divide between the political left and right which had prevailed in the province since the depression and the rise of the labour movement sharpened as socalled free enterprise parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by social credit—in opposition to the social democratic new democratic party the successor to the cooperative commonwealth federation as the provinces economy blossomed so did labourmanagement tensions tensions emerged also from the counterculture movement of the late s of which vancouver and nanaimo were centres the conflict between hippies and vancouver mayor tom campbell was particularly legendary culminating in the socalled gastown riots of  by the end of the decade with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the status quo rising the bennett governments achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity s and sedit on august   the social credit party was reelected in a general election for what would be bennetts final term in power at the start of the s the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector however bc hydro reported its first loss which was the beginning of the end for bennett and the social credit party the socreds were forced from power in the august  election paving the way for a provincial new democratic party ndp government under dave barrett under barrett the large provincial surplus soon became a deficitcitation needed although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous social credit regime and its two sets of books as wac bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management the brief threeyear thousand days period of ndp governance brought several lasting changes to the province most notably the creation of the agricultural land reserve intended to protect farmland from redevelopment and the insurance corporation of british columbia a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing singlepayer basic automobile insurance perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too farreaching coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the ndp in the  general election social credit under wac bennetts son bill bennett was returned to office under the younger bennetts government  of the provinces land base was transferred from government reserve to management by the ministry of forests reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the premiers office and ndpinstigated social programs were rolled back with thenhuman resources minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy although the newera socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the ndp—notably the creation of the resort municipality of whistler whose special status including sunday drinking then an anomaly in bc also during the miniwac regime a reference to his fathers acronym wac certain moneylosing crownowned assets were privatized in a mass giveaway of shares in the british columbia resources investment corporation bcric with the brick shares soon becoming nearworthless towards the end of his tenure in power bennett oversaw the completion of several megaprojects meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most rightwing parties british columbias social credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy most notable of these was the winning of a worlds fair for vancouver which came in the form of expo  to which was tied the construction of the coquihalla highway and vancouvers skytrain system the coquihalla highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premiers brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal the doman scandal in which the premier and millionaire backer herb doman were investigated for insidertrading and securities fraud nonetheless the socreds were reelected in  under bennett who led the party until  the coquihalla highway the road was one of the legacies of the expo  worlds fair the creation of the toll highway sparked controversy as the province entered a sustained recession bennetts popularity and media image were in decline on april   premier bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government and the lieutenantgovernor henry pybus bellirving was forced to call bennett to government house to resolve the impasse and an election was called for april  while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the executive council no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis campaigning on a platform of moderation bennett won an unexpected majority after several weeks of silence in the aftermath a sitting of the house was finally called and in the speech from the throne the socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed restraint which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign the programme included cuts to motherhood issues of the left including the human rights branch the offices of the ombudsman and rentalsman womens programs environmental and cultural programs while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate british columbia this sparked a backlash with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to  people this became known as the  solidarity crisis from the name of the solidarity coalition a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized consisting of organized labour and community groups with the british columbia federation of labour forming a separate organization of unions operation solidarity under the direction of jack munro thenpresident of the international woodworkers of america iwa the most powerful of the provinces resource unions tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a general strike would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the ndp and the left just as a strike at pacific press ended which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the provinces major papers the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and iwa president jack munro and premier bennett a tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued as among the new laws were those enabling nonunion labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues with companies from alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with unionscale british columbia companies despite the tension bennetts last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with expo and bennett was to end his career by hosting prince charles and lady diana on their visit to open expo  his retirement being announced a social credit convention was scheduled for the whistler resort which came down to a threeway shooting match between bud smith the premiers righthand man but an unelected official social credit party grande dame grace mccarthy and the charismatic but eccentric bill vander zalm bill vander zalm became the new socred leader when smith threw his support to him rather than see mccarthy win and led the party to victory in the election later that year vander zalm was later involved in a conflict of interest scandal following the sale of fantasy gardens a christian and dutch culture theme park built by the premier to tan yu a filipino chinese gambling kingpin there were also concerns over yus application to the government for a bank licence and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor faye leung of a party in the howard hughes suite on the top two floors of the bayshore inn where tan yu had been staying with reports of a bag of money in a brown paper bag passed from yu to vander zalm during the goingson these scandals forced vander zalms resignation and rita johnston became premier of the province johnston presided over the end of social credit power calling an election which led to the reducing of the partys caucus to only two seats and the revival of the

the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in british columbia an allegation never substantiated that the premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to clarks resignation as premier he was succeeded on an interim basis by dan miller who was in turn followed by ujjal dosanjh following a leadership convention in the  general election gordon campbells bc liberals defeated the ndp gaining  out of  total seats in the provincial legislature campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the ndps policies including scrapping the fast ferries project lowering income taxes and the controversial sale of bc rail to cn rail campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for driving under the influence during a vacation in hawaii however campbell still managed to lead his party to victory in the  general election against a substantially strengthened ndp opposition campbell won a third term in the british columbia general election  marking the first time in  years that a premier has been elected to a third term the province won a bid to host the  winter olympics in vancouver and whistler as promised in his

responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid sixtyfour percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games after the olympic joy had faded campbells popularity started to fall his management style the implementation of the harmonized sales tax hst against election promises and the cancelling of the bc rail corruption trial lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support he would resign in november  and call on the party to elect a new leader in early  christy clark former deputy premier would become leader of the liberal party though she was not currently a sitting mla she would go on to win the seat left vacant by campbell and form a government for the next two years she would attempt to distance herself from the unpopularity of campbell and forge an image for the upcoming election among her early accomplishments she raised the minimum wage created the new holiday of family day and pushed the development of bcs liquified natural gas in the  election the liberals lagged behind the ndp with a doubledigit gap in the polls but were able to come to a surprise victory on election night with a majority making clark the first elected female premier in bc history while clark lost her seat to ndp candidate david eby she later won a byelection in the riding of westsidekelowna her government would go on to balance the budget implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed enbridge northern gateway pipelines then in the  election the ndp would form a minority government with the support from the green party with just a slight edge over the liberal party  in the legislature then on july th the leader of the bc ndp john horgan would officially be sworn in as premier of british columbia with bc green party leader

governed by the british columbia new democratic party in a minority supported by the british columbia green party led by premier john horgan who became premier as a result of a noconfidence motion on june   british columbia evolved from british possessions that were established in what is now british columbia by  first nations the original inhabitants of the land have a history of at least  years in the area today there are few treaties and the question of aboriginal title long ignored has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions notably the tsilhqotin nation has established aboriginal title to a portion of their territory as a result of the recent supreme court of canada decision william tsilhqotin nation v british columbia bcs economy is diverse with service producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the provinces gdp it is the endpoint of transcontinental railways and the site of major pacific ports that enable international trade though less than  of its vast  km  sq mi land is arable the province is agriculturally rich particularly in the fraser and okanagan valleys because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction principally logging farming and mining vancouver the provinces largest city and metropolitan area also serves as the headquarters of many westernbased natural resource companies it also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average while the coast of british columbia and certain valleys in the southcentral part of the province have mild weather the majority of its land mass

for the territory drained by the columbia river in southeastern british columbia which was the namesake of the preoregon treaty columbia department of the hudsons bay company queen victoria chose british columbia to distinguish what was the british sector of the columbia district from that of the united states american columbia or southern columbia which became the oregon territory on august   as a result of the treaty ultimately the columbia in the name british columbia is derived from the name of the columbia rediviva an american ship which lent its name to the columbia river and later the wider region the columbia in the name columbia rediviva came from the name columbia for the new world or parts thereof a reference to christopher columbus geographyedit main article geography of british columbia british columbias geography is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief which has defined patterns of settlement and industry since colonization british columbia is bordered by the pacific ocean on the west side by the american state of alaska to the northwest and parts of the west on the north by yukon and the northwest territories on the east by the province of alberta and on the south by the states of washington idaho and montana the current southern border of british columbia was established by the  oregon treaty although its history is tied with lands as far south as california british columbias land area is  square kilometres  sq mi british columbias rugged coastline stretches for more than  kilometres  mi and includes deep mountainous fjords and about  islands most of which are uninhabited it is the only province in canada that borders the pacific ocean british columbias capital is victoria located at the southeastern tip of vancouver island only a narrow strip of the island from campbell river to victoria is significantly populated much of the western part of vancouver island and the rest of the coast is covered by thick tall and sometimes impenetrable temperate rainforest the provinces most populous city is vancouver which is located at the confluence of the fraser river and georgia strait in the southwest corner of the mainland an area often called the lower mainland by land area abbotsford is the largest city vanderhoof is near the geographic centre of the province the coast mountains and the inside passages many inlets provide some of british columbias renowned and spectacular scenery which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and ecotourism industry seventyfive percent of the province is mountainous more than  metres  ft above sea level  is forested and only about  is arable the provinces mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the pacific ocean terrain ranges from dry inland forests and semiarid in numerous valleys to the range and canyon districts of the central and southern interior to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the northern interior the okanagan area extending from near vernon to osoyoos at the united states border is one of several wine and ciderproducing regions in canada other wine regions in british columbia include the cowichan valley on vancouver island and the fraser valley the southern interior cities of kamloops and penticton have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in canada although their temperatures can be exceeded north of the fraser canyon close to the confluence of the fraser and thompson rivers where the terrain is rugged and covered with deserttype flora semidesert grassland is found in large areas of the interior plateau with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones the northern mostly mountainous twothirds of the province are largely unpopulated and undeveloped except for the area east of the rockies where the peace river district in the northeast of the province contains bcs portion of the canadian prairies centred at dawson creek climateedit köppen climate types in british columbia strait of georgia near vancouver coastal southern british columbia has a mild rainy oceanic climate some far southern parts of which are warmsummer mediterranean influenced by the north pacific current which has its origins in the kuroshio current due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges the climate of the interior of the province is semiarid with certain locations receiving less than  mm  in annual precipitation the annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to  °c  °f the mildest anywhere in canada the valleys of the southern interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow while those in the cariboo in the central interior are colder because of increased altitude and latitude but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in canada for example the average daily low in prince george roughly located in the middle of the province in january is − °c  °f heavy snowfall occurs in all elevated mountainous terrain providing bases for skiers in both south and central british columbia winters are generally severe in the northern interior but even there milder air can penetrate far inland the coldest temperature in british columbia was recorded in smith river where it dropped to − °c − °f on january   one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in north america atlin in the provinces far northwest along with the adjoining southern lakes region of yukon get midwinter thaws caused by the chinook effect which is also common and much warmer in more southerly parts of the interior during winter on the coast rainfall sometimes relentless heavy rain dominates because of consistent barrages of cyclonic lowpressure systems from the north pacific average snowfall on the coast during an average winter is between  and  cm  and  in but on occasion and not every winter heavy snowfalls with more than  cm  in and well below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas typically for short periods and can take temperatures below − °c  °f even at sea level and arctic outflow winds can make wind chill temperatures at or even below − °c  °f for a couple of mornings while winters are very wet coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer under the influence of stable anticyclonic high pressure southern interior valleys are hot in summer for example in osoyoos the july maximum temperature averages  °c  °f the hottest month of any place in canada this hot weather sometimes spreads towards the coast or to the far north of the province temperatures often exceed  °c  °f in the lower elevations of valleys in the interior during midsummer with the record high of  °c  °f being held in lytton on july   the okanagan region has a climate suitable to vineyards the extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires from drylightning or manmade causes many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during the winter months in contrast to abundant summer sunshine annual sunshine

history of first nations groups and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period the arrival of paleoindians from beringia took place between  and  years ago hunter gatherer families were the main social structure from  to  years ago the nomadic population lived in nonpermanent structures foraging for nuts berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs around  years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary lifestyle these indigenous populations evolved over the next  years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs to the

the nadene language group is believed to be linked to the yeniseian languages of siberia the dene of the western arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from asia to north america the interior of british columbia was home to the salishan language groups such as the shuswap secwepemc okanagan and athabaskan language groups primarily the dakelh carrier and the tsilhqotin the inlets and valleys of the british columbia coast sheltered large distinctive populations such as the haida kwakwakawakw and nuuchahnulth sustained by the regions abundant salmon and shellfish these peoples developed complex cultures dependent on the western red cedar that included wooden houses seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved potlatch items and totem poles contact with europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from europe that the people had no immunity to the result was a dramatic population collapse culminating in the  smallpox outbreak in victoria that spread throughout the coast european settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of british columbia colonial officials deemed that colonists could make better use of the

spain conceded its claims of exclusivity in the pacific this opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers including britain but because of the napoleonic wars there was little british action on its claims in the region until later the establishment of trading posts under the auspices of the north west company and the hudsons bay company hbc effectively established a

three fur trading departments the bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the new caledonia district administered from fort st james the interior south of the thompson river watershed and north of the columbia was organized into the columbia district administered from fort vancouver on the lower columbia river the northeast corner of the province east of the rockies known as the peace river block was attached to the much larger athabasca district headquartered in fort chipewyan in presentday alberta until  these districts were a wholly unorganized area of british north america under the de facto jurisdiction of hbc administrators unlike ruperts land to the north and east however the territory was not a concession to the company rather it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the first nations inhabitants all that was changed with the westward extension of american exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty especially in the southern columbia basin within present day washington and oregon in  the oregon treaty divided the territory along the th parallel to the strait of georgia with the area south of this boundary excluding vancouver island and the gulf islands transferred to sole american sovereignty the colony of vancouver island was created in  with victoria designated as the capital new

colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and found a second england on the shores of the pacific lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force he sought men who possessed courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the english gentleman and british officer at the head of the royal engineers columbia detachment moody and his family arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary in british columbia moody wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending miles to the right  left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities  yet fr the background of superb mountains swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbingport moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor later gold rushesedit a series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed the largest being the cariboo gold rush in  forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of farflung boom communities like barkerville and lillooet which sprang up overnight the vancouver island colony was facing financial crises of its own and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in  when the colony of british

been created out of three british north american colonies in  the province of canada nova scotia and new brunswick several factors motivated this agitation including the fear of annexation to the

okanagan forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast which was also the locus of a growing fishery the completion of the railway in  was a huge boost to the provinces economy facilitating the transportation of the regions considerable resources to the east the milltown of granville known as gastown near the mouth of the burrard inlet was selected as the terminus of the railway prompting the incorporation of the city as vancouver in  the completion of the port of vancouver spurred rapid growth and in less than fifty years the city surpassed winnipeg manitoba as the largest in western canada the early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically its settlement and development—were paramount this included expropriation from first nations people of their land control over its resources as well as the ability to trade in some resources such as the fishery establishing a labour force to develop the province was problematic from the start and british columbia was the locus of immigration from europe china and japan the influx of a noncaucasian population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups resulting in agitation much of it successful to restrict the ability of asian people to immigrate to british columbia through the imposition of a head tax this resentment culminated in mob attacks against chinese and japanese immigrants in vancouver in  and  by  almost all chinese immigration had been blocked except for merchants professionals students and investors meanwhile the province continued to grow in  the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line the grand trunk pacific linking northcentral british columbia from the yellowhead pass through prince george to prince rupert was driven at fort fraser this opened up the north coast and the bulkley valley region to new economic opportunities what had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus

vote in the prohibition of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hardcore drinking that vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war because of pressure from veterans prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the soldier and the working man could enjoy a drink but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by european immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of soldier parties to represent their interests variously named soldierfarmer soldierlabour and farmerlabour parties these formed the basis of the fractured labourpolitical spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties including those who would eventually form the cooperative commonwealth and the early social credit splinter groups internment camp for the japanese canadians during world war ii the advent of prohibition in the united states created new opportunities and many found employment or at least profit in crossborder liquor smuggling much of vancouvers prosperity and opulence in the s results from this pirate economy although growth in forestry fishing and mining continued the end of us prohibition combined with the onset of the great depression plunged the province into economic destitution compounding the already dire local economic situation tens of thousands of men from colder parts of canada swarmed into vancouver creating huge hobo jungles around false creek and the burrard inlet rail yards including the old canadian pacific railway mainline rightofway through the heart of the citys downtown at hastings and carrall increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts an occupation of the main post office at granville and hastings which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of martial law on the docks for almost three years a vancouver contingent for the ontoottawa trek was organized and seized a train which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a gatling gun straddling the tracks at mission the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the depression there were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the s but it was the onset of world war ii which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the depression because of the war effort women entered the workforce as never before british columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the pacific ocean to have close relations with east asia however this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward asian immigrants this was most manifest during the second world war when many people of japanese descent were relocated or interned in the interior of the province coalition and the postwar boomedit the bc regiment dcor marching in new westminster  during world war ii the mainstream bc liberal and bc conservative parties of british columbia united in a formal coalition government under new liberal leader john hart who replaced duff pattullo when the latter failed to win a majority in the  election while the liberals won the most number of seats they actually received fewer votes than the socialist cooperative commonwealth federation ccf pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival conservatives led by royal maitland and was replaced by hart who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five liberal and three conservative ministers the ccf was invited to join the coalition but refused the pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of world war ii was to prevent the ccf which had won a surprise victory in saskatchewan in  from ever coming to power in british columbia the ccfs popular vote was high enough in the  election that they were likely to have won threeway contests and could have formed government however the coalition prevented that by uniting the antisocialist vote in the postwar environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects notably the completion of highway  north of prince george to the peace river block a section called the john hart highway and also public hospital insurance in  the reins of the coalition were taken over by byron ingemar johnson the conservatives had wanted their new leader herbert anscomb to be premier but the liberals in the coalition refused johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in british columbia history  in the  election this victory was attributable to the popularity of his governments spending programmes despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power during his tenure major infrastructures continued to expand such as the agreement with alcan aluminum to build the town of kitimat with an aluminum smelter and the large kemano hydro project johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the  flooding of the fraser valley which was a major blow to that region and to the provinces economy increasing tension between the liberal and conservative coalition partners led the liberal party executive to vote to instruct johnson to terminate the arrangement johnson ended the coalition and dropped his conservative cabinet ministers including deputy premier and finance minister herbert anscomb precipitating the general election of  a referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot similar to a preferential ballot where voters could select second and third choices the intent of the ballot as campaigned for by liberals and conservatives was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the ccf but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties including the ccf voted for the fringe british columbia social credit party socreds who wound up with the largest number of seats in the house  only one seat ahead of the ccf despite the ccf having  of the vote to social credits  the social credit party led by rebel former conservative mla w a c bennett formed a minority government backed by the liberals and conservatives with  and  seats respectively bennett began a series of fiscal reforms preaching a new variety of populism as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development laying the ground for a second election in  in which the new bennett regime secured a majority of seats with  of the vote secure with that majority bennett returned the province to the firstpastthepost system thereafter which is still in use today –sedit with the election of the social credit party british columbia embarked on a phase of rapid economic development bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry mining and energy sectors during these two decades the government nationalized british columbia electric and the british columbia power company as well as smaller electric companies renaming the entity bc hydro west kootenay power and light remained independent of bc hydro being owned and operated by cominco though tied into the regional power grid by the end of the s several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the peace columbia and nechako river watersheds the nechako diversion to kemano was to supply power to the alcan inc aluminum smelter at kitimat and was not part of the provincial power grid but privately owned major transmission deals were concluded most notably the columbia river treaty between canada and the united states the provinces economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector as well as oil and gas development in the provinces northeast the s and s were also marked by development in the provinces transportation infrastructure in  the government established bc ferries as a crown corporation to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system also supported by federal grants as being part of the transcanada highway system that system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges and paving of existing highways and provincial roads vancouver and victoria became cultural centres as poets authors artists musicians as well as dancers actors and haute cuisine chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures with the cultural and entrepreneurial community notably bolstered by many draft dodgers from the united states similarly these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics commentators and creative thinkerscitation needed tourism also began to play an important role in the economy the rise of japan and other pacific economies was a great boost to british columbias economy primarily because of massive exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees politically and socially the s brought a period of significant social ferment the divide between the political left and right which had prevailed in the province since the depression and the rise of the labour movement sharpened as socalled free enterprise parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by social credit—in opposition to the social democratic new democratic party the successor to the cooperative commonwealth federation as the provinces economy blossomed so did labourmanagement tensions tensions emerged also from the counterculture movement of the late s of which vancouver and nanaimo were centres the conflict between hippies and vancouver mayor tom campbell was particularly legendary culminating in the socalled gastown riots of  by the end of the decade with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the status quo rising the bennett governments achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity s and sedit on august   the social credit party was reelected in a general election for what would be bennetts final term in power at the start of the s the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector however bc hydro reported its first loss which was the beginning of the end for bennett and the social credit party the socreds were forced from power in the august  election paving the way for a provincial new democratic party ndp government under dave barrett under barrett the large provincial surplus soon became a deficitcitation needed although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous social credit regime and its two sets of books as wac bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management the brief threeyear thousand days period of ndp governance brought several lasting changes to the province most notably the creation of the agricultural land reserve intended to protect farmland from redevelopment and the insurance corporation of british columbia a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing singlepayer basic automobile insurance perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too farreaching coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the ndp in the  general election social credit under wac bennetts son bill bennett was returned to office under the younger bennetts government  of the provinces land base was transferred from government reserve to management by the ministry of forests reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the premiers office and ndpinstigated social programs were rolled back with thenhuman resources minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy although the newera socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the ndp—notably the creation of the resort municipality of whistler whose special status including sunday drinking then an anomaly in bc also during the miniwac regime a reference to his fathers acronym wac certain moneylosing crownowned assets were privatized in a mass giveaway of shares in the british columbia resources investment corporation bcric with the brick shares soon becoming nearworthless towards the end of his tenure in power bennett oversaw the completion of several megaprojects meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most rightwing parties british columbias social credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy most notable of these was the winning of a worlds fair for vancouver which came in the form of expo  to which was tied the construction of the coquihalla highway and vancouvers skytrain system the coquihalla highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premiers brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal the doman scandal in which the premier and millionaire backer herb doman were investigated for insidertrading and securities fraud nonetheless the socreds were reelected in  under bennett who led the party until  the coquihalla highway the road was one of the legacies of the expo  worlds fair the creation of the toll highway sparked controversy as the province entered a sustained recession bennetts popularity and media image were in decline on april   premier bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government and the lieutenantgovernor henry pybus bellirving was forced to call bennett to government house to resolve the impasse and an election was called for april  while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the executive council no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis campaigning on a platform of moderation bennett won an unexpected majority after several weeks of silence in the aftermath a sitting of the house was finally called and in the speech from the throne the socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed restraint which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign the programme included cuts to motherhood issues of the left including the human rights branch the offices of the ombudsman and rentalsman womens programs environmental and cultural programs while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate british columbia this sparked a backlash with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to  people this became known as the  solidarity crisis from the name of the solidarity coalition a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized consisting of organized labour and community groups with the british columbia federation of labour forming a separate organization of unions operation solidarity under the direction of jack munro thenpresident of the international woodworkers of america iwa the most powerful of the provinces resource unions tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a general strike would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the ndp and the left just as a strike at pacific press ended which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the provinces major papers the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and iwa president jack munro and premier bennett a tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued as among the new laws were those enabling nonunion labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues with companies from alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with unionscale british columbia companies despite the tension bennetts last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with expo and bennett was to end his career by hosting prince charles and lady diana on their visit to open expo  his retirement being announced a social credit convention was scheduled for the whistler resort which came down to a threeway shooting match between bud smith the premiers righthand man but an unelected official social credit party grande dame grace mccarthy and the charismatic but eccentric bill vander zalm bill vander zalm became the new socred leader when smith threw his support to him rather than see mccarthy win and led the party to victory in the election later that year vander zalm was later involved in a conflict of interest scandal following the sale of fantasy gardens a christian and dutch culture theme park built by the premier to tan yu a filipino chinese gambling kingpin there were also concerns over yus application to the government for a bank licence and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor faye leung of a party in the howard hughes suite on the top two floors of the bayshore inn where tan yu had been staying with reports of a bag of money in a brown paper bag passed from yu to vander zalm during the goingson these scandals forced vander zalms resignation and rita johnston became premier of the province johnston presided over the end of social credit power calling an election which led to the reducing of the partys caucus to only two seats and the revival of the longdefunct british columbia liberal party as opposition to the victorious ndp under former vancouver mayor mike harcourt in  david lam was appointed as british columbia’s twentyfifth lieutenantgovernor and was the provinces first lieutenantgovernor of chinese origin s to presentedit this article needs to be updated please update this section to reflect recent events or newly available information august  johnston lost the  general election to the ndp under the leadership of mike harcourt a former mayor of vancouver the ndps unprecedented creation of new parkland and protected areas was popular and helped boost the provinces growing tourism sector however the economy continued to struggle against the backdrop of a weak resource economy housing starts and an expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade despite political turmoil harcourt ended up resigning over bingogate—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings harcourt was not implicated but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside glen clark a former president of the bc federation of labour was chosen the new leader of the ndp which won a second term in  more scandals dogged the party most notably the fast ferry scandal involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in british columbia an allegation never substantiated that the premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to clarks resignation as premier he was succeeded on an interim basis by dan miller who was in turn followed by ujjal dosanjh following a leadership convention in the  general election gordon campbells bc liberals defeated the ndp gaining  out of  total seats in the provincial legislature campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the ndps policies including scrapping the fast ferries project lowering income taxes and the controversial sale of bc rail to cn rail campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for driving under the influence during a vacation in hawaii however campbell still managed to lead his party to victory in the  general election against a substantially strengthened ndp opposition campbell won a third term in the british columbia general election  marking the first time in  years that a premier has been elected to a third term the province won a bid to host the  winter olympics in vancouver and whistler as promised in his  reelection campaign vancouver mayor larry campbell staged a nonbinding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the olympics in february  vancouvers residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid sixtyfour percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games after the olympic joy had faded campbells popularity started to fall his management style the implementation of the harmonized sales tax hst against election promises and the cancelling of the bc rail corruption trial lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support he would resign in november  and call on the party to elect a new leader in early  christy clark former deputy premier would become leader of the liberal party though she was not currently a sitting mla she would go on to win the seat left vacant by campbell and form a government for the next two years she would attempt to distance herself from the unpopularity of campbell and forge an image for the upcoming election among her early accomplishments she raised the minimum wage created the new holiday of family day and pushed the development of bcs liquified natural gas in the  election the

new democratic party bc ndp under premierdesignate john horgan the  provincial election saw the liberal party take  seats the ndp take  and the british columbia green party take  no party met the

of british columbia – was founded by richard clement moody and the royal engineers columbia detachment in response to the fraser canyon gold rush moody was chief commissioner of lands and works for the colony and the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia he was handpicked by the colonial office in london to transform british columbia into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west

governed by the british columbia new democratic party in a minority supported by the british columbia green party led by premier john horgan who became premier as a result of a noconfidence motion on june   british columbia evolved from british possessions that were established in what is now british columbia by  first nations the original inhabitants of the land have a history of at least  years in the area today there are few treaties and the question of aboriginal title long ignored has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions notably the tsilhqotin nation has established aboriginal title to a portion of their territory as a result of the recent supreme court of canada decision william tsilhqotin nation v british columbia bcs economy is diverse with service producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the provinces gdp it is the endpoint of transcontinental railways and the site of major pacific ports that enable international trade though less than  of its vast  km  sq mi land is arable the province is agriculturally rich particularly in the fraser and okanagan valleys because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction principally logging farming and mining vancouver the provinces largest city and metropolitan area also serves as the headquarters of many westernbased natural resource companies it also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average while the coast of british columbia and certain valleys in the southcentral part of the province have mild weather the majority of its land mass

for the territory drained by the columbia river in southeastern british columbia which was the namesake of the preoregon treaty columbia department of the hudsons bay company queen victoria chose british columbia to distinguish what was the british sector of the columbia district from that of the united states american columbia or southern columbia which became the oregon territory on august   as a result of the treaty ultimately the columbia in the name british columbia is derived from the name of the columbia rediviva an american ship which lent its name to the columbia river and later the wider region the columbia in the name columbia rediviva came from the name columbia for the new world or parts thereof a reference to christopher columbus geographyedit main article geography of british columbia british columbias geography is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief which has defined patterns of settlement and industry since colonization british columbia is bordered by the pacific ocean on the west side by the american state of alaska to the northwest and parts of the west on the north by yukon and the northwest territories on the east by the province of alberta and on the south by the states of washington idaho and montana the current southern border of british columbia was established by the  oregon treaty although its history is tied with lands as far south as california british columbias land area is  square kilometres  sq mi british columbias rugged coastline stretches for more than  kilometres  mi and includes deep mountainous fjords and about  islands most of which are uninhabited it is the only province in canada that borders the pacific ocean british columbias capital is victoria located at the southeastern tip of vancouver island only a narrow strip of the island from campbell river to victoria is significantly populated much of the western part of vancouver island and the rest of the coast is covered by thick tall and sometimes impenetrable temperate rainforest the provinces most populous city is vancouver which is located at the confluence of the fraser river and georgia strait in the southwest corner of the mainland an area often called the lower mainland by land area abbotsford is the largest city vanderhoof is near the geographic centre of the province the coast mountains and the inside passages many inlets provide some of british columbias renowned and spectacular scenery which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and ecotourism industry seventyfive percent of the province is mountainous more than  metres  ft above sea level  is forested and only about  is arable the provinces mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the pacific ocean terrain ranges from dry inland forests and semiarid in numerous valleys to the range and canyon districts of the central and southern interior to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the northern interior the okanagan area extending from near vernon to osoyoos at the united states border is one of several wine and ciderproducing regions in canada other wine regions in british columbia include the cowichan valley on vancouver island and the fraser valley the southern interior cities of kamloops and penticton have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in canada although their temperatures can be exceeded north of the fraser canyon close to the confluence of the fraser and thompson rivers where the terrain is rugged and covered with deserttype flora semidesert grassland is found in large areas of the interior plateau with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones the northern mostly mountainous twothirds of the province are largely unpopulated and undeveloped except for the area east of the rockies where the peace river district in the northeast of the province contains bcs portion of the canadian prairies centred at dawson creek climateedit köppen climate types in british columbia strait of georgia near vancouver coastal southern british columbia has a mild rainy oceanic climate some far southern parts of which are warmsummer mediterranean influenced by the north pacific current which has its origins in the kuroshio current due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges the climate of the interior of the province is semiarid with certain locations receiving less than  mm  in annual precipitation the annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to  °c  °f the mildest anywhere in canada the valleys of the southern interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow while those in the cariboo in the central interior are colder because of increased altitude and latitude but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in canada for example the average daily low in prince george roughly located in the middle of the province in january is − °c  °f heavy snowfall occurs in all elevated mountainous terrain providing bases for skiers in both south and central british columbia winters are generally severe in the northern interior but even there milder air can penetrate far inland the coldest temperature in british columbia was recorded in smith river where it dropped to − °c − °f on january   one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in north america atlin in the provinces far northwest along with the adjoining southern lakes region of yukon get midwinter thaws caused by the chinook effect which is also common and much warmer in more southerly parts of the interior during winter on the coast rainfall sometimes relentless heavy rain dominates because of consistent barrages of cyclonic lowpressure systems from the north pacific average snowfall on the coast during an average winter is between  and  cm  and  in but on occasion and not every winter heavy snowfalls with more than  cm  in and well below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas typically for short periods and can take temperatures below − °c  °f even at sea level and arctic outflow winds can make wind chill temperatures at or even below − °c  °f for a couple of mornings while winters are very wet coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer under the influence of stable anticyclonic high pressure southern interior valleys are hot in summer for example in osoyoos the july maximum temperature averages  °c  °f the hottest month of any place in canada this hot weather sometimes spreads towards the coast or to the far north of the province temperatures often exceed  °c  °f in the lower elevations of valleys in the interior during midsummer with the record high of  °c  °f being held in lytton on july   the okanagan region has a climate suitable to vineyards the extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires from drylightning or manmade causes many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during the winter months in contrast to abundant summer sunshine annual sunshine

cordillera taiga plains boreal plains ecozones historyedit main article history of british columbia first nations aboriginal historyedit main articles indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast indigenous peoples of the northwest plateau and the canadian crown and aboriginal peoples the area that is now known as british columbia is home to first nations groups that have a deep history with a significant percentage of indigenous languages there are more than  first nations in bc prior to contact with nonaboriginal people human history is known from archaeological investigations an oral history of first nations groups and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period the arrival of paleoindians from beringia took place between  and  years ago hunter gatherer families were the main social structure from  to  years ago the nomadic population lived in nonpermanent structures foraging for nuts berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs around  years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary lifestyle these indigenous populations evolved over the next  years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs to the northwest of the province are the peoples of the nadene languages which include the athapaskanspeaking peoples and the tlingit who lived on the islands of southern alaska and northern british columbia the nadene language group is believed to be linked to the yeniseian languages of siberia the dene of the western arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from asia to north america the interior of british columbia was home to the salishan language groups such as the shuswap secwepemc okanagan and athabaskan language groups primarily the dakelh carrier and the tsilhqotin the inlets and valleys of the british columbia coast sheltered large distinctive populations such as the haida kwakwakawakw and nuuchahnulth sustained by the regions abundant salmon and shellfish these peoples developed complex cultures dependent on the western red cedar that included wooden houses seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved potlatch items and totem poles contact with europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from europe that the people had no immunity to the result was a dramatic population collapse culminating in the  smallpox outbreak in victoria that spread throughout the coast european settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of british columbia colonial officials deemed that colonists could make better use of the land than the first nations people and thus the land territory be owned by the colonists to ensure colonists would be able to settle properly and make use of the land natives were relocated onto reserves which were often too small to support their way of life by the s over  reserves were located within british columbia fur trade and colonial eraedit the british during the colonial period spread across the world claiming territories and building the british empire lands now known as british columbia were added to the empire during the th century originally established under the auspices of the hudsons bay company colonies were established vancouver island the mainland that were amalgamated then entered confederation as british columbia in  as part of the dominion of canada

spanish fort san miguel at nootka in  kwakwakawakw house pole second half of the th century the arrival of europeans began around the midth century as fur traders entered the area to harvest sea otters while it is thought that sir francis drake may have explored the british columbian coast in  it was juan pérez who completed the first documented voyage which took place in  juan francisco de la bodega y quadra explored the coast in  in doing so pérez and quadra reasserted the spanish claim for the pacific coast first made by vasco núñez de balboa in  the explorations of james cook in  and george vancouver in – established british jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the columbia river in  sir alexander mackenzie was the first european to journey across north america overland to the pacific ocean inscribing a stone marking his accomplishment on the shoreline of dean channel near bella coola his expedition theoretically established british sovereignty inland and a succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the canadian prairies and the pacific mackenzie and other explorers—notably john finlay simon fraser samuel black and david thompson—were primarily concerned with extending the fur trade rather than political considerations in  by the third of a series of agreements known as the nootka conventions spain conceded its claims of exclusivity in the pacific this opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers including britain but because of the napoleonic wars there was little british action on its claims in the region until later the establishment of trading posts under the auspices of the north west company and the hudsons bay company hbc effectively established a permanent british presence in the region the columbia district was broadly defined as being south of ° north latitude the southern limit of russian america north of mexicancontrolled california and west of the rocky mountains it was by the angloamerican convention of  under the joint occupancy and use of citizens of the united states and subjects of britain which is to say the fur companies this cooccupancy was ended with the oregon treaty of  the major supply route was the york factory express between hudson bay and fort vancouver some of the early outposts grew into settlements communities and cities among the places in british columbia that began as fur trading posts are fort st john established  hudsons hope  fort nelson  fort st james  prince george  kamloops  fort langley  fort victoria  yale  and nanaimo  fur company posts that became cities in what is now the united states include vancouver washington fort vancouver formerly the capital of hudsons bay operations in the columbia district colville washington and walla walla washington old fort nez percés with the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in  the region now comprising british columbia existed in three fur trading departments the bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the new caledonia district administered from fort st james the interior south of the thompson river watershed and north of the columbia was organized into the columbia district administered from fort vancouver on the lower columbia river the northeast corner of the province east of the rockies known as the peace river block was attached to the much larger athabasca district headquartered in fort chipewyan in presentday alberta until  these districts were a wholly unorganized area of british north america under the de facto jurisdiction of hbc administrators unlike ruperts land to the north and east however the territory was not a concession to the company rather it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the first nations inhabitants all that was changed with the westward extension of american exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty especially in the southern columbia basin within present day washington and oregon in  the oregon treaty divided the territory along the th parallel to the strait of georgia with the area south of this boundary excluding vancouver island and the gulf islands transferred to sole american sovereignty the colony of vancouver island was created in  with victoria designated as the capital new caledonia as the whole of the mainland rather than just its northcentral interior came to be called continued to be an unorganized territory of british north america administered by individual hbc trading post managers colony of british columbia –edit main articles colony of british columbia – and richard clement moody with the fraser canyon gold rush in  an influx of americans into new caledonia prompted the colonial office to designate the mainland as the colony of british columbia when news of the fraser canyon gold rush reached london richard clement moody was handpicked by the colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and found a second england on the shores of the pacific lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force he sought men who possessed courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the english gentleman and british officer at the head of the royal engineers columbia detachment moody and his family arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary in british columbia moody wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending miles to the right  left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities  yet fr the background of superb mountains swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbingport moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor later gold rushesedit a series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed the largest being the cariboo gold rush in  forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of farflung boom communities like barkerville and lillooet which sprang up overnight the vancouver island colony was facing financial crises of its own and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in  when the colony of british

condition of entry into confederation the confederation league including such figures as amor de cosmos john robson and robert beaven led the chorus pressing for the colony to join canada which had been created out of three british north american colonies in  the province of canada nova scotia and new brunswick several factors motivated this agitation including the fear of annexation to the united states the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth the need for governmentfunded services to support this population and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush memorial last spike in craigellachie with the agreement by the canadian government to extend the canadian pacific railway to british columbia and to assume the colonys debt british columbia became the

in  the provinces territory shrank again after the alaska boundary dispute settled the vague boundary of the alaska panhandle population in british columbia continued to expand as the provinces mining forestry agriculture and fishing sectors were developed mining activity was particularly notable throughout the mainland particularly in the boundary country in the slocan in the west kootenay around

colony agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile fraser valley and cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the thompson river area the cariboo the chilcotin and the okanagan forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast which was also the locus of a growing fishery the completion of the railway in  was a huge boost to the provinces economy facilitating the transportation of the regions considerable resources to the east the milltown of granville known as gastown near the mouth of the burrard inlet was selected as the terminus of the railway prompting the incorporation of the city as vancouver in  the completion of the port of vancouver spurred rapid growth and in less than fifty years the city surpassed winnipeg manitoba as the largest in western canada the early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically its settlement and development—were paramount this included expropriation from first nations people of their land control over its resources as well as the ability to trade in some resources such as the fishery establishing a labour force to develop the province was problematic from the start and british columbia was the locus of immigration from europe china and japan the influx of a noncaucasian population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups resulting in agitation much of it successful to restrict the ability of asian people to immigrate to british columbia through the imposition of a head tax this resentment culminated in mob attacks against chinese and japanese immigrants in vancouver in  and  by  almost all chinese immigration had been blocked except for merchants professionals students and investors meanwhile the province continued to grow in  the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line the grand trunk pacific linking northcentral british columbia from the yellowhead pass through prince george to prince rupert was driven at fort fraser this opened up the north coast and the bulkley valley region to new economic opportunities what had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus for forestry farming and mining in world war i the province responded strongly to the call to assist the british empire against its german foes in french and belgian battlefields about  of the  british columbian residents the highest percapita rate in canada responded to the military needs horseriders from the provinces interior region and first nations soldiers made contributions to vimy ridge and other battles about  men from the province died in combat s through sedit when the men returned from world war i they discovered the recently enfranchised women of the province had helped vote in the prohibition of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hardcore drinking that vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war because of pressure from veterans prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the soldier and the working man could enjoy a drink but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by european immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of soldier parties to represent their interests variously named soldierfarmer soldierlabour and farmerlabour parties these formed the basis of the fractured labourpolitical spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties including those who would eventually form the cooperative commonwealth and the early social credit splinter groups internment camp for the japanese canadians during world war ii the advent of prohibition in the united states created new opportunities and many found employment or at least profit in crossborder liquor smuggling much of vancouvers prosperity and opulence in the s results from this pirate economy although growth in forestry fishing and mining continued the end of us prohibition combined with the onset of the great depression plunged the province into economic destitution compounding the already dire local economic situation tens of thousands of men from colder parts of canada swarmed into vancouver creating huge hobo jungles around false creek and the burrard inlet rail yards including the old canadian pacific railway mainline rightofway through the heart of the citys downtown at hastings and carrall increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts an occupation of the main post office at granville and hastings which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of martial law on the docks for almost three years a vancouver contingent for the ontoottawa trek was organized and seized a train which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a gatling gun straddling the tracks at mission the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the depression there were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the s but it was the onset of world war ii which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the depression because of the war effort women entered the workforce as never before british columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the pacific ocean to have close relations with east asia however this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward asian immigrants this was most manifest during the second world war when many people of japanese descent were relocated or interned in the interior of the province coalition and the postwar boomedit the bc regiment dcor marching in new westminster  during world war ii the mainstream bc liberal and bc conservative parties of british columbia united in a formal coalition government under new liberal leader john hart who replaced duff pattullo when the latter failed to win a majority in the  election while the liberals won the most number of seats they actually received fewer votes than the socialist cooperative commonwealth federation ccf pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival conservatives led by royal maitland and was replaced by hart who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five liberal and three conservative ministers the ccf was invited to join the coalition but refused the pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of world war ii was to prevent the ccf which had won a surprise victory in saskatchewan in  from ever coming to power in british columbia the ccfs popular vote was high enough in the  election that they were likely to have won threeway contests and could have formed government however the coalition prevented that by uniting the antisocialist vote in the postwar environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects notably the completion of highway  north of prince george to the peace river block a section called the john hart highway and also public hospital insurance in  the reins of the coalition were taken over by byron ingemar johnson the conservatives had wanted their new leader herbert anscomb to be premier but the liberals in the coalition refused johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in british columbia history  in the  election this victory was attributable to the popularity of his governments spending programmes despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power during his tenure major infrastructures continued to expand such as the agreement with alcan aluminum to build the town of kitimat with an aluminum smelter and the large kemano hydro project johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the  flooding of the fraser valley which was a major blow to that region and to the provinces economy increasing tension between the liberal and conservative coalition partners led the liberal party executive to vote to instruct johnson to terminate the arrangement johnson ended the coalition and dropped his conservative cabinet ministers including deputy premier and finance minister herbert anscomb precipitating the general election of  a referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot similar to a preferential ballot where voters could select second and third choices the intent of the ballot as campaigned for by liberals and conservatives was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the ccf but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties including the ccf voted for the fringe british columbia social credit party socreds who wound up with the largest number of seats in the house  only one seat ahead of the ccf despite the ccf having  of the vote to social credits  the social credit party led by rebel former conservative mla w a c bennett formed a minority government backed by the liberals and conservatives with  and  seats respectively bennett began a series of fiscal reforms preaching a new variety of populism as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development laying the ground for a second election in  in which the new bennett regime secured a majority of seats with  of the vote secure with that majority bennett returned the province to the firstpastthepost system thereafter which is still in use today –sedit with the election of the social credit party british columbia embarked on a phase of rapid economic development bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry mining and energy sectors during these two decades the government nationalized british columbia electric and the british columbia power company as well as smaller electric companies renaming the entity bc hydro west kootenay power and light remained independent of bc hydro being owned and operated by cominco though tied into the regional power grid by the end of the s several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the peace columbia and nechako river watersheds the nechako diversion to kemano was to supply power to the alcan inc aluminum smelter at kitimat and was not part of the provincial power grid but privately owned major transmission deals were concluded most notably the columbia river treaty between canada and the united states the provinces economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector as well as oil and gas development in the provinces northeast the s and s were also marked by development in the provinces transportation infrastructure in  the government established bc ferries as a crown corporation to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system also supported by federal grants as being part of the transcanada highway system that system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges and paving of existing highways and provincial roads vancouver and victoria became cultural centres as poets authors artists musicians as well as dancers actors and haute cuisine chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures with the cultural and entrepreneurial community notably bolstered by many draft dodgers from the united states similarly these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics commentators and creative thinkerscitation needed tourism also began to play an important role in the economy the rise of japan and other pacific economies was a great boost to british columbias economy primarily because of massive exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees politically and socially the s brought a period of significant social ferment the divide between the political left and right which had prevailed in the province since the depression and the rise of the labour movement sharpened as socalled free enterprise parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by social credit—in opposition to the social democratic new democratic party the successor to the cooperative commonwealth federation as the provinces economy blossomed so did labourmanagement tensions tensions emerged also from the counterculture movement of the late s of which vancouver and nanaimo were centres the conflict between hippies and vancouver mayor tom campbell was particularly legendary culminating in the socalled gastown riots of  by the end of the decade with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the status quo rising the bennett governments achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity s and sedit on august   the social credit party was reelected in a general election for what would be bennetts final term in power at the start of the s the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector however bc hydro reported its first loss which was the beginning of the end for bennett and the social credit party the socreds were forced from power in the august  election paving the way for a provincial new democratic party ndp government under dave barrett under barrett the large provincial surplus soon became a deficitcitation needed although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous social credit regime and its two sets of books as wac bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management the brief threeyear thousand days period of ndp governance brought several lasting changes to the province most notably the creation of the agricultural land reserve intended to protect farmland from redevelopment and the insurance corporation of british columbia a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing singlepayer basic automobile insurance perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too farreaching coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the ndp in the  general election social credit under wac bennetts son bill bennett was returned to office under the younger bennetts government  of the provinces land base was transferred from government reserve to management by the ministry of forests reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the premiers office and ndpinstigated social programs were rolled back with thenhuman resources minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy although the newera socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the ndp—notably the creation of the resort municipality of whistler whose special status including sunday drinking then an anomaly in bc also during the miniwac regime a reference to his fathers acronym wac certain moneylosing crownowned assets were privatized in a mass giveaway of shares in the british columbia resources investment corporation bcric with the brick shares soon becoming nearworthless towards the end of his tenure in power bennett oversaw the completion of several megaprojects meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most rightwing parties british columbias social credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy most notable of these was the winning of a worlds fair for vancouver which came in the form of expo  to which was tied the construction of the coquihalla highway and vancouvers skytrain system the coquihalla highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premiers brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal the doman scandal in which the premier and millionaire backer herb doman were investigated for insidertrading and securities fraud nonetheless the socreds were reelected in  under bennett who led the party until  the coquihalla highway the road was one of the legacies of the expo  worlds fair the creation of the toll highway sparked controversy as the province entered a sustained recession bennetts popularity and media image were in decline on april   premier bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government and the lieutenantgovernor henry pybus bellirving was forced to call bennett to government house to resolve the impasse and an election was called for april  while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the executive council no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis campaigning on a platform of moderation bennett won an unexpected majority after several weeks of silence in the aftermath a sitting of the house was finally called and in the speech from the throne the socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed restraint which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign the programme included cuts to motherhood issues of the left including the human rights branch the offices of the ombudsman and rentalsman womens programs environmental and cultural programs while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate british columbia this sparked a backlash with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to  people this became known as the  solidarity crisis from the name of the solidarity coalition a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized consisting of organized labour and community groups with the british columbia federation of labour forming a separate organization of unions operation solidarity under the direction of jack munro thenpresident of the international woodworkers of america iwa the most powerful of the provinces resource unions tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a general strike would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the ndp and the left just as a strike at pacific press ended which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the provinces major papers the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and iwa president jack munro and premier bennett a tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued as among the new laws were those enabling nonunion labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues with companies from alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with unionscale british columbia companies despite the tension bennetts last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with expo and bennett was to end his career by hosting prince charles and lady diana on their visit to open expo  his retirement being announced a social credit convention was scheduled for the whistler resort which came down to a threeway shooting match between bud smith the premiers righthand man but an unelected official social credit party grande dame grace mccarthy and the charismatic but eccentric bill vander zalm bill vander zalm became the new socred leader when smith threw his support to him rather than see mccarthy win and led the party to victory in the election later that year vander zalm was later involved in a conflict of interest scandal following the sale of fantasy gardens a christian and dutch culture theme park built by the premier to tan yu a filipino chinese gambling kingpin there were also concerns over yus application to the government for a bank licence and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor faye leung of a party in the howard hughes suite on the top two floors of the bayshore inn where tan yu had been staying with reports of a bag of money in a brown paper bag passed from yu to vander zalm during the goingson these scandals forced vander zalms resignation and rita johnston became premier of the province johnston presided over the end of social credit power calling an election which led to the reducing of the partys caucus to only two seats and the revival of the

expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade despite political turmoil harcourt ended up resigning over bingogate—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings harcourt was not implicated but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside glen clark a former president of the bc federation of labour was chosen the new leader of the ndp which won a second term in  more scandals dogged the party most notably the fast ferry scandal involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in british columbia an allegation never substantiated that the premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to clarks resignation as premier he was succeeded on an interim basis by dan miller who was in turn followed by ujjal dosanjh following a leadership convention in the  general election gordon campbells bc liberals defeated the ndp gaining  out of  total seats in the provincial legislature campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the ndps policies including scrapping the fast ferries project lowering income taxes and the controversial sale of bc rail to cn rail campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for driving under the influence during a vacation in hawaii however campbell still managed to lead his party to victory in the  general election against a substantially strengthened ndp opposition campbell won a third term in the british columbia general election  marking the first time in  years that a premier has been elected to a third term the province won a bid to host the  winter olympics in vancouver and whistler as promised in his  reelection campaign vancouver mayor larry campbell staged a nonbinding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the olympics in february  vancouvers residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid sixtyfour percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games after the olympic joy had faded campbells popularity started to fall his management style the implementation of the harmonized sales tax hst against election promises and the cancelling of the bc rail corruption trial lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support he would resign in november  and call on the party to elect a new leader in early  christy clark former deputy premier would become leader of the liberal party though she was not currently a sitting mla she would go on to win the seat left vacant by campbell and form a government for the next two years she would attempt to distance herself from the unpopularity of campbell and forge an image for the upcoming election among her early accomplishments she raised the minimum wage created the new holiday of family day and pushed the development of bcs liquified natural gas in the  election the liberals lagged behind the ndp with a doubledigit gap in the polls but were able to come to a surprise victory on election night with a majority making clark the first elected female premier in bc history while clark lost her seat to ndp candidate david eby she later won a byelection in the riding of westsidekelowna her government would go on to balance the budget implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed enbridge northern gateway pipelines then in the  election the ndp would form a minority government with the support from the green party with just a slight edge over the liberal party  in the legislature then on july th the leader of the bc ndp john horgan would officially be sworn in as premier of british columbia with bc green party leader

appointments to be made based on the recommendations of a new advisory board that would use nonpartisan criteria hours after that plan was unveiled in ottawa on december   clark issued a statement that it did not address what’s been wrong with the senate since the beginning the imbalance in representation in that house is apparent when considering population size the six senators from bc constitute only one for every  people vs one for every  in pei which has four senators nova scotia and new brunswick have much smaller populations than bc yet each has ten senators according to a

role in british columbias history the rocky mountains and the ranges west of them constituted a significant obstacle to overland travel until the completion of the transcontinental railway in  the peace river canyon through the rocky mountains was the route that the earliest explorers and fur traders used fur trade routes were only marginally used for access to british columbia through the mountains travel from the rest of canada before  meant the difficulty of overland travel via the united states around cape horn or overseas from asia nearly all travel and freight to and from the region occurred via the pacific ocean primarily through the ports of victoria and new westminster until the s rail was the only means of overland travel to and from the rest of canada travellers using motor vehicles needed to journey through the united states with the construction of the interprovincial highway in  now known as the crowsnest pass highway and later the transcanada highway road

bridge on highway  in richmonddelta because of its size and rugged varying topography british columbia requires thousands of kilometres of provincial highways to connect its communities british columbias roads systems were notoriously poorly maintained and dangerous until a concentrated programme of improvement was initiated in the s and s there are now freeways in greater victoria the lower mainland and central interior of the province much of the rest of the province where traffic volumes are generally low is accessible by wellmaintained generally highmobility twolane arterial highways with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas and usually only a few stopcontrolled intersections outside the main urban areas a couple of busy intercity corridors outside greater vancouver feature more heavily signalized limitedmobility arterial highways that are mostly fourlane and often divided by portable median traffic barriers highway  on vancouver island and highway  through the okanagan valley are medium to highvolume roadways with variable posted speeds that range from  kmh to maximums just slightly lower than the principal gradeseparated highways numerous traffic lights operate in place of interchanges on both arterials as longterm costcutting measures signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along interurban sections where traffic volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of highmobility alternative routes or bypasses the building and maintenance of provincial highways is the responsibility of the british columbia ministry of transportation and infrastructure there are only five major routes to the rest of canada from south to north they are bc highway  through the crowsnest pass the vermilion pass highway  in both british columbia and alberta the kicking horse pass the latter being used by the transcanada highway

surpassed ormsby posited a series of propositions that provided the dynamic to the history the ongoing pull between maritime and continental forces the opposition between a closed hierarchical model

time of contact varied according to circumstance but took place on the coast between the s and  in places in the interior it occurred later british columbia before the arrival of the europeans was home to many indigenous peoples speaking more than  different languages including babinewitsuwiten danezaa beaver carrier chilcotin gitxsan haida halkomelem kaska kutenai lillooet nisgaa nuuchahnulth nuxalk sekani shuswap sinixt squamish tagish tahltan thompson tlingit tsetsaut and tsimshian there was frequent contact between bands and voyages across the strait of georgia and the strait of juan de fuca were common the abundance of natural resources such as salmon and cedar enabled the development of a complex hierarchical society within coastal communities with so much food being available the peoples of the coastal regions could focus their time on other pursuits such as art politics and warfare early spanish explorersedit the first visitors to presentday british columbia were spanish sailors and other european sailors who sailed for the spanish crown there is some evidence that the greekborn juan de fuca who sailed for spain and explored the west coast of north america in the s might have reached the passageway between washington state and vancouver island—today known as the strait of juan de fuca a later british explorer named charles william barkley named the passage after juan de fucas reputed visit there is not much evidence to suggest that european traders and explorers regularly came to presentday british columbia in the th century the arrival of europeans began to intensify in the midth century as fur traders entered the area to harvest sea otters while there is a theory and some evidence that sir francis drake may have explored the british columbia coast in  it is conventionally claimed that it was juan francisco de la bodega y quadra who completed the first documented voyage which took place in  in doing so quadra reasserted the spanish claim for the whole of the pacific coast first made by vasco núñez de balboa in  who declared the whole of the pacific and its shores as part of the spanish empire in  the spanish navigator juan josé pérez hernández a native of mexico sailed from san blas nueva galicia modernday nayarit with instructions to reach ° north latitude to discover possible russian settlements and take possession of the lands for the spanish crown hernández reached ° north latitude becoming the first european to sight the queen charlotte islands and vancouver island he traded with the natives near estevan point although apparently without landing the expedition was forced to return to nueva galicia due to the lack of provisions since pérez hernándezs first expedition failed to achieve its objective the spanish organized a second expedition in  with the same goal this expedition was commanded by bruno de heceta on board the santiago piloted by pérez hernández and accompanied by juan francisco de la bodega y quadra in la sonora after illnesses storms and other troubles had affected the expedition de heceta returned to nueva galicia while quadra kept on a northward course ultimately reaching ° north in what today is sitka alaska during this expedition the spanish made sure to land several times and formally claim the lands for the spanish crown while verifying the absence of russian settlements along the coast in the following years several other spanish expeditions would set sail from nueva galicia bound for the pacific northwest three years later in  the british royal navy captain james cook arrived in the region searching for the northwest passage and successfully landed at nootka sound on vancouver island where he and his crew traded with the nuuchahnulth first nation upon trading his goods for sea otter pelts his crew in turn traded them for an enormous profit in macau on their way back to britain this led to an influx of traders to the british columbian coast and ongoing

vii from a voyage of discovery to the north pacific ocean and round the world by george vancouver in  john meares an english navigator and explorer sailed from china and explored nootka sound and the neighbouring coasts he bought some land from a local chief named maquinna and built a trading post there two years later in  the spanish commander esteban josé martínez a native of seville established a settlement and started building a fort in friendly cove nootka sound which was named fort san miguel this territory was already considered as part of new spain by the spanish due to the previous explorations of the region upon martinezs arrival a number of british ships were seized including those of captain meares this originated the nootka crisis which almost led to a war between britain and spain the controversy resulted in the abandonment of the nootka sound settlement by the spanish some months later manuel antonio flores viceroy of new spain ordered a francisco de eliza to rebuild the fort the expedition composed of three ships the concepción under the command of de eliza the san carlos under the command of salvador fidalgo and the princesa real under the command of manuel quimper sailed in early  from san blas in nueva galicia and arrived at nootka sound in april of that year the expedition had many catalan volunteers from the first free company of volunteers of catalonia commanded by pere dalberní a native of tortosa the expedition rebuilt the fort which had been dismantled after martínez abandoned it the rebuilt fort included several defensive constructions as well as a vegetable garden to ensure the settlement had food supplies the catalan volunteers left the fort in  and spanish influence in the region ended in  after the nootka convention came into force late british expeditions s–edit subsequently european explorermerchants from the east started to discover british columbia three figures dominate in the early history of mainland british columbia sir alexander mackenzie simon fraser and david thompson as employees of the north west company the three were primarily concerned with discovering a practicable river route to the pacific specifically via the columbia river for the extension of the fur trade in  mackenzie became the first european to reach the pacific overland north of the rio grande he and his crew entered the region through the rocky mountains via the peace river reaching the ocean at north bentinck arm near presentday bella coola shortly thereafter mackenzies companion john finlay founded the first permanent european settlement in british columbia fort st john located at the junction of the beatton and peace rivers simon fraser was the next to try to find the course of the columbia during his expedition of  fraser and his crew including john stuart explored much of the british columbia interior establishing several forts hudsons hope trout lake fort fort george fort fraser and fort st james frasers expedition took him down the river that now bears his name to the site of presentday vancouver although both mackenzie and fraser reached the pacific they found the routes they took impassable for trade it was david thompson who found the columbia river and followed it down to its mouth in  he was unable to establish a claim however for the american explorers lewis and clark had already claimed the territory for the united states of america six years earlier the american fur company of john jacob astor had founded fort astoria just months before thompson arrived though within a year the local staff at astoria sold the fort and others in the region to the north west company which renamed it fort george though returned to us hands as a result of treaty complications at the end of the war of  this meant only there was a parallel us fort adjacent to the nwc one which was the more prosperous of the two following the forced merger of the north west company and hudsons bay company in  fort vancouver was established as the new regional headquarters from fur trade districts to colonies –edit although technically a part of british north america british columbia was largely run by the hudsons bay company after its merger with the north west company in  the central interior of the region was organized into the new caledonia district a name that came to be generally attributed to the mainland as a whole it was administered from fort st james about  km northwest of presentday prince george the interior south of the thompson river and north of california was named by the company the columbia district and was administered first from fort vancouver present day vancouver washington throughout the s and s the hbc controlled nearly all trading operations in the pacific northwest based out of the company headquarters at fort vancouver on the columbia river although authority over the region was nominally shared by the united states and britain through the angloamerican convention of  company policy enforced via chief factor john mcloughlin of the companys columbia district was to discourage any settlement including us settlement of the territory the companys effective monopoly on trade virtually forbade any settlement in the region it established fort boise in  in presentday southwestern idaho to compete with the american fort hall  km  mi to the east in  it purchased fort hall also along the route of the oregon trail where the outpost director displayed the abandoned wagons of discouraged settlers to those seeking to move west along the trail fort vancouver was the nexus for the fur trade on the pacific coast its influence reached from the rocky mountains to the hawaiian islands and from alaska into mexicancontrolled california at its pinnacle fort vancouver watched over  outposts  ports six ships and  employees also for many primarily american settlers the fort became the last stop on the oregon trail as they could get supplies before starting their homestead by  the hudsons bay company operated numerous posts in the columbia department including fort vancouver fort george astoria fort nisqually fort umpqua fort langley fort colville fort okanogan fort kamloops fort alexandria flathead post kootanae house fort boise fort hall fort simpson fort taku fort mcloughlin in milbanke sound fort stikine as well as a number of others a very high degree of linguistic variation occurs in bc  a response to this was the development of a trade jargon  chinook jargon not a complete language it was used in trade governance and some early writings for example hymns by  john jacob astor had founded astoria and ten years later the hudsons bay company had established itself on the columbia in the meantime the explorers and traders had been coming by land somewhere and sometime during this period the existence of the chinook jargon became known all the indians talked it to each other and resorted to it in their conversations with the whites knowledge of this trade language became a necessary part of the traders equipment fort victoria was established as a trading post in  both as a means to protect hbc interests as well as to assert british claims to vancouver island and the adjacent gulf islands the gulf islands and strait of juan de fuca are the access point to puget sound as well as a fall back position in preparation for the worst case scenario settlement of the dispute in the face of manifest destiny increasing numbers of american settlers arriving on the oregon trail gave rise to the oregon boundary dispute the hudsons bay company dominated and controlled all territory north of the columbia river the british position was that a fair division of the columbia district was a boundary at the columbia river in  the united states democratic party asserted that the us had a legitimate claim to the entire columbia district or oregon country but president james polk was prepared to draw the border along the th parallel the longstanding us proposal when the british rejected this offer polk broke off negotiations and american expansionists reasserted the claim coining slogans most famously fiftyfour forty or fight with the outbreak of the mexicanamerican war diverting attention and resources polk was again prepared to compromise the oregon boundary dispute was settled in the  treaty of washington the terms of the agreement established the border between british north america and the united states at the th parallel from the rocky mountains to the sea the original american proposal with all of vancouver island retained as british territory this effectively destroyed the geographical logic of the hbcs columbia department since the lower columbia river was the core and lifeline of the system the us soon organized its portion as the oregon territory the administrative headquarters of fur operations and of the columbia department then shifted north to fort victoria which had been founded by james douglas in  the crown colony of vancouver island was created and in  james douglas was appointed governor douglas known as the father of british columbia established colonial institutions in victoria he started the process of expanding the economic base of the new colony by signing  treaties between  to purchase land for settlement and industrial development coal deposits were known by the hwbc in the vicinities of nanaimo and fort rupert subsequent native population crashes later in the th century along with economic upheaval and native wars allowed his political successors to be much less consistent with british principles treaties and laws meanwhile on the mainland new caledonia continued to focus on the fur trade with few nonnative inhabitants mostly hbc employees and their familiescitation needed under the administrative oversight of douglas who was also the hbcs regional chief executive the hudsons bay company like the previous french colony and north west company of montreal still officially discouraged settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade the fur trade was a mutually beneficial relationship between the local hbc trading fort and adjacent native tribes american expansion and control of territory was predicated primarily by settlement of the land not commercial relationships with the existing local population the british made virtually no effort to assert sovereignty over the aboriginal peoples of the area in accordance with the royal proclamation of  largescale settlement by nonaboriginal people was prohibited until the lands were surrendered by treaty colonial british columbia –edit in  gold was found along the banks of the thompson river just east of what is now lytton british columbia triggering the fraser canyon gold rush when word got out to san francisco about gold in british territory victoria was transformed overnight into a tent city as prospectors speculators land agents and outfitters flooded in from around the world mostly via san francisco the hudsons bay companys fort langley burgeoned economically as the staging point for many of the prospectors heading by boat to the canyon a wide range of linguistic diversity among first nations and explorerstraders made communication difficult trade jargon initially used by first nations expanded and changed to include words from english and french to become the chinook jargon not a complete language the jargon became widespread among first nations and early europeans to enable communication and trade though little used today a significant number of place names in british columbia deprive from chinook and early anthropologists sometimes recorded stories using the jargon at the time the region was still not under formal colonial authority douglas fearing challenges to the claim of british sovereignty in the region in the face of an influx of some  americans stationed a gunboat at the mouth of the fraser in order to obtain license fees from those seeking to head upstream the resolution of the oregon boundary dispute whereby british interests primarily the hbc lost governance of all territory between the th parallel and the columbia river due to a sudden influx of american settlers  years previous richard clement moody and the royal engineersedit when news of the fraser canyon gold rush reached london the colonial office established the mainland as a crown colony on august   naming it the colony of british columbia richard clement moody was handpicked by the colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia – into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and “found a second england on the shores of the pacific” lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force’ he sought men who possessed ‘courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world’ and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the archetypal english gentleman and british officer’ at the head of the columbia detachment which was created by an act of the british parliament on  august  the engineers were believed to exemplify the qualities sought by the government col richard moody commander of the columbia detachment moody arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary and the two became close friends ned mcgowans waredit moody had hoped to begin immediately the foundation of a capital city but upon his arrival at fort langley he learned of an outbreak of violence at the settlement of hills bar this led to an incident popularly known as ned mcgowans war where moody led  engineers and judge matthew baillie begbie to yale to face down a group of rebellious american miners order was restored without further strict pain  the foundation of new westminsteredit in british columbia moody ‘wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness’ and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance ‘styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe’ subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending miles to the right  left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities  yet fr the background of superb mountains swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody likened his vision of the nascent colony of british columbia to the pastoral scenes painted by aelbert cuyp moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town’ and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuous hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled’ the feud between moody and governor james douglasedit throughout his tenure in british columbia richard clement moody was engaged in a bitter feud with sir james douglas governor of vancouver island whose jurisdiction overlapped with his own moody’s position as chief commissioner and lieutenantgovernor was one of ‘higher prestige and lesser authority than that of douglas despite moodys vastly superior social position in the eyes of the engineers and the british government moody had been selected by lord lytton due to his possession of the quality of the archetypal english gentleman and british officer his family was eminently respectable he was the son of colonel thomas moody  one of the wealthiest mercantilists in the west indies who owned much of the land in the islands where douglass father owned a small amount of land and from which douglass mother a halfbreed originated governor douglass ethnicity and made him ‘an affront to victorian society’ mary moody the descendant of the hawks industrial dynasty and the boyd merchant banking family wrote on  august  it is not pleasant to serve under a hudsons bay factor and that the governor and richard can never get on in letter to the colonial office of  december  richard clement moody boasts that he has ‘entirely disarmed douglas of all jealously douglas repeatedly insulted the engineers by attempting to assume their command and refusing to acknowledge their value in the nascent colony margaret a ormsby author of the dictionary of canadian biography entry for moody  condemns moody for a contribution to the abortive development of the city however most other historians have exonerated moody for the abortive development of the city and consider his achievement to be impressive especially with regard to the perpetual insufficiency of funds and the personally motivated opposition of douglas whose opposition to the project continually retarded its development robert edgar cail don w thomson ishiguro and scott have praised moody for his contribution the latter accusing ormsby of being ‘adamant in her dislike of colonel moody’ despite the evidence and almost all biographies of moody including those of the institute of civil engineers the royal engineers and the british columbia historical association are flattering other developmentsedit moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbing port moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor frederick seymour second governor of the colony of british columbia and his cat royal engineers columbia detachment was disbanded in july  the moody family only  men and  wives returned to england while the rest  sappers elected to remain in bc scott contends that the departure of the engineers doomed the development of the settlement and the fruition of lord lyttons dream chartres brew replaced moody as land commissioner the second gold rushedit a second major gold rush in the cariboo region of the colony occurred in  in the midst of smaller ones notably in the omenica big bend and on the stikine the influx of gold miners into bcs economy led to the creation of basic infrastructure in bc most notably the creation of the cariboo wagon road which linked the lower mainland to the rich gold fields of barkerville however the enormous costs of the road and its predecessor the douglas road and services such as the gold escort left bc in debt by the mids in  because of the massive debt leftover from the gold rush the mainland and vancouver island became one colony named british columbia with its capital in victoria on vancouver island settlement and industrial development took place along the shorelines for example see the th century settlement in comox or colony of vancouver island annexation debateedit in  there were three options open to continue as a british colony to be annexed by the united states or to confederate with the newly formed dominion of canada in britain many little englanders expected or even hoped that its north american colonies would depart from the british empire admiral joseph denman told the admiralty that british columbia did not deserve royal navy protection and advised the british government to divest herself of these possessions by any means consistent with honour secretary of state for the colonies lord granville stated his wish that british north america would propose to be independent and annex themselves the times view was the british consensus british columbia is a long way off  with the exception of a limited official class it receives few immigrants from england and a large proportion of its inhabitants consists of citizens of the united states who have entered it from the south suppose that the colonists met together and came to the conclusion that every natural motive of contiguity similarity of interests and facility of administration induced them to think it more convenient to slip into the union than into the dominion  we all know that we should not attempt to withstand them financially becoming officially part of the united states made sense since british columbia was economically essentially a satellite of san francisco—the most important city of the entire american west and north americas pacific coast—washington and oregon which provided all of the colonys supplies despite a substantial american tariff american currency circulated widely in the colony whose nearest british neighbors were red river  miles to the east and hong kong to the west san franciscos population in the s exceeded  while victorias never rose above  all mail from british columbia went through san francisco forcing the colonys post office to keep large amounts of american postage stamps– the opening of the american transcontinental railroad in  made it possible to travel by ship from victoria to san francisco then by train to ottawa or washington in just  days with the gold now gone most of the american miners had left and the economic future did not look promising unless bc could join the very rapidly growing rich economies of the pacific states while american residents of british columbia celebrated the united states purchase of alaska in  having american territory to their north and south caused british residents fears for the future of their colony to grow alaska was part of american secretary of state william h sewards plan to incorporate the entire northwest pacific coast chiefly for the longterm commercial advantages to the united states in terms of pacific trade seward believed that the people in british columbia wanted annexation and that britain would accept this in exchange for the alabama claims in the event seward dropped the idea of an exchange and accepted an arbitration plan that settled the alabama claims for cash when a false report circulated in april soon after the alaska news that the british government was considering settling the claims by ceding the colony a substantial annexation movement appeared supported by many residents and three of the colonys six newspapers anticonfederationists who were not necessarily annexationists were the majority on vancouver island that said annexationists argued that the colony would never be able to negotiate with the united states a free trade agreement similar to the reciprocity treaty of  and that annexation would end the disadvantage of the american tariff most canadianborn residents supported confederation with their land of origin but were not very popular as many in the colony believed that they sent their money home instead of spending it in british columbia as the americanborn colonists did residents of the mainland almost unanimously supported confederation with the rest of british north america they argued that this would benefit the colony as canada would soon negotiate another reciprocity treaty many britishborn colonists were on both sides–– representative nathaniel p banks of massachusetts annexation bill of  offered voluntary annexation to british north america including territorial status for vancouver island and british columbia together as the territory of columbia the bill was unsuccessful as was senator alexander ramsey of minnesotas  proposal that the united states as part of another reciprocity treaty with canada offer  million to the hudsons bay company for the territory west of the th longitude the us would assume british columbias  million debt and subsidize the northern pacific railway to build a road to puget sound– two american military officers who travelled throughout british columbia for two months while arranging for supply of occupation troops in alaska wrote a detailed report to washington in november  of their belief that a majority of residents supported annexation they claimed that it did not become necessary in a single instance to broach the subject of the cession of that territory to the united states for it was the constant theme of conversation employees of the hudsons bay company were said to be especially supportive although they and many others could not make their opinion public because of fears of being denounced as disloyal a majority of british columbians never publicly supported american annexation however and support for joining canada grew over time in particular annexationists failed to persuade the anticonfederation hudsons bay company officials and their friends that dominated vancouver island politics accusations that american gold and american greenbacks funded renegade englishmen likely hurt annexation support whether the us officers belief of the existence of widespread covert support was correct by october  annexation no longer appeared as a topic in british columbia newspapers or documents until the alaska purchase and the new dominion status which were almost simultaneous the british had been indifferent to the fate of british columbia london now paid attention and realized the value of bc as a base for its imperial trade opportunities in the pacific and the need of the royal navy for a station in the region by  public opinion was likely on the confederation side annexationists or at least anticonfederationists were in control of the legislative council of british columbia however and in february  passed a resolution opposing confederation until his death the colonial governor frederick seymour also opposed confederation successor anthony musgrave supported confederation after being unsuccessful in bringing newfoundland into canada but due to an accident was delayed in his duties meanwhile annexation support revived during the winter of  one hundred four individuals about one percent of the white population of the colony signed an  petition to president ulysses s grant asking for annexation while there is no reason to believe that they accurately represented the majority opinion it is true that many colonists viewed washington and london as equal competitors for british columbias loyalty depending on who offered more incentives while ottawa was more foreign and less familiar– in august  lord granville communicated londons new view of british columbia when he wrote to musgrave i have no hesitation in stating that support of confederation is also the opinion of her majestys government in february  musgrave successfully persuaded the legislative council to pass a resolution supporting confederation with canada many britishborn colonists now supported confederation as the best way to maintain a connection with britain by april the victoria colonist reported that a mass meeting in victoria supported confederation while the most vague hint in the direction of annexation was met with a howl of execration musgrave proposed an attractive plan for joining canada with the dominion assuming the colonys debt and building a new canadian transcontinental railway that would eliminate the reliance on the american railroad meanwhile the united states was so focused on issues of reconstruction that few americans picked up on sewards grand dream to expand manifest destiny to the pacific entry into canada –edit see also british columbia § rapid growth and development  map of british columbia showing federal electoral districts a map produced in london in  to facilitate emigration to british columbia showing the natural resources of the new province both the depressed economic situation arising from the collapse of the gold rushes as well as a desire for the establishment of truly responsible and representative government led to enormous domestic pressure for british columbia to join the canadian confederation which had been proclaimed in  the confederation league spearheaded by three future premiers of the province — amor de cosmos robert beaven and john robson — took a leading role in pushing the colony towards this goal and so it was on july   that british columbia became the sixth province to join canada in return for entering confederation canada absorbed bcs massive debt and promised to build a railway from montreal to the pacific coast within  years contrary to popular belief british columbia did not demand a transcontinental railroad as a condition of confederation its delegates expected a wagon road but john a macdonalds national government proposed the railroad as a substitute with ottawa and london viewing it as a way of connecting not just british columbia but the prairies with the rest of the british empire– the promise of a railroad became however the most important reason for british columbia to stay within canada the provincial legislature threatened to secede in  because macdonalds successor alexander mackenzie whose liberal party had opposed the railroad attempted to modify the promise macdonalds return to power that year likely kept british columbia from departing canada– in fulfillment of the promise the last spike of the canadian pacific railway was driven in craigellachie on  november  no good road yet existed between british columbia and other provinces until the completion of the transcanada highway automobiles had to enter the united states to travel to eastern canada– the mining frontier in bc led to the creation of many mines and smelters mostly through american investment one of the worlds largest smelters still exists today in trail the capital and work to be found in bc during the turn of the th century to the th century led to the creation of several new towns in bc such as nelson nakusp slocan kimberley castlegar rossland and salmo a large coal empire run by robert dunsmuir and his son and later premier james dunsmuir also developed on vancouver island during this era as the economy on the mainland continued to improve as a result of improved transportation and increased settlement other resourcebased economic activity began to flourish throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century fishing forestry and farming including the planting of extensive orchards in the okanagan region became the three fs on which the new province built its economy — a situation that persisted well into the late twentieth century with the booming economy came the expansion of the original fur trading posts into thriving communities such as victoria nanaimo and kamloops it also led to the establishment of new communities such as yale new westminster and — most notably though a latecomer — vancouver the product of the consolidation of the burgeoning mill towns of granville and hastings mill located near the mouth of the fraser on burrard inlet in the later s vancouver was incorporated in  following its selection as the railhead for the canadian pacific railway despite a devastating fire which all but wiped out the city three months later vancouver quickly became the largest city in the province its ports conveying both the resource wealth of the province as well as that transported from the prairie provinces by rail to markets overseas vancouvers status as the principal city in the province has endured augmented by growth in the surrounding municipalities of richmond burnaby surrey delta coquitlam and new westminster today metro vancouver is the third most populous metropolitan area in

unemployed men flooded the city to protest conditions in the relief camps run by the military in remote areas throughout the province after two tense months of daily and disruptive protesting the

it possible for the government to amerce or to seize property without due process and the civil forfeiture office cfo has been eager to use this power in order to fill the coffers of government the office does not need criminal charges or convictions to amerce a property bill  was introduced by solicitorgeneral rich coleman who made liberal use of the organised crime fear uncertainty and doubt tactic he also mentioned that ontario manitoba and alberta had also recently introduced similar legislation the act which was brought in with organised crime as the target since at least  has been expanded to target ordinary citizens in latterday practice amercements may include partial jang or full seizure lloydsmith rai of a house on  may  solicitorgeneral shirley bond of christy clarks first government introduced the concept of administrative forfeiture under which a civil court is no longer required to judge amercements of property worth less than  the cfo moved in summer  to seize the guide certificate of robert milligan a certain way to destroy his livelihood the cfo has a budgetary target offences under the motor vehicle act wildlife act and employment standards act are now pursued by the cfo the public is now bribed with the proceeds for example violenceprevention projects at six schools an antigang campaign women and family violence programs and a workshop on sexual exploitation awareness justice minister suzanne anton expressed unreserved support for the cfo and cfa in a january  interview first nationsedit the legacy of british imperialism in bc is unusual in that neither conquest nor treaties were undertaken as settlement occurred under the doctrine of terra nullius with few exceptions the douglas treaties of fort rupert and southern vancouver island no treaties were signed some early settlers assumed based on the catastrophic population crash of first nations peoples linked to smallpox and racist ideas that indians were a dying race led to a lack of action to deal with what was then termed the indian land question upon confederation the federal government assumed responsibility for indians and lands reserved for indians while the province had responsibility for nonaboriginal civil matters and resources the  mckennamcbride royal commission made some amendments to lands but failed to deal with issues pertaining to title and first nations rights several delegations to ottawa and london were sent by first nations seeking redress for grievances to little avail instead the indian act federal legislation governing first nations was amended to make it a crime to organize or engage legal council other oppressive measure also accompanied the amendment including the potlatch ban and the increasingly applied indian residential school system designed to assimilate first nations the status of the first nations aboriginal people of british columbia is a longstanding problem that has become a major issue in recent years first nations were confined to tiny reserves that no longer provide an economic base they were provided with inadequate education and discriminated against in numerous ways in many areas they were excluded from restaurants and other establishments status indians gained the right to vote in  they were prohibited from possessing alcohol which rather than preventing problems with this drug exacerbated them by fostering unhealthy patterns of consumption such as binge drinkingcitation needed certain privileges of status indians are governed by the indian act with the exception of what are known as the douglas treaties negotiated by sir james douglas with the native people of the victoria area no treaties were signed in british columbia until  many native people wished to negotiate treaties but the province refused until  another major development was the  decision of the supreme court of canada in the delgamuukw v british columbia case that aboriginal title still exists in british columbia  of first nations in british columbia are aligned with the first nations summit this brings a total of  first nations but only  are said to be in active negotiations three final agreements have been settled with one being rejected by lheidli tenneh in  the other two the maanulth treaty group a  nuuchahnulth member group and the tsawwassen first nation although these treaties have yet to be ratified by parliament in ottawa and legislature in victoria neighbouring first nations are seeking to block these treaties in the courts a group of vancouver island and some mainland first nations the wsanec lekwungen and semiahmoo are seeking to block to tsawwassen first nation treaty claiming infringement on their rights and land titles on the west coast of vancouver island the ditidaht first nation is doing the same against the maanulth treaty group the only treaty signed in recent years the nisgaa treaty  was negotiated outside of the current treaty process there is considerable disagreement about treaty negotiations among indigenous people there is mounting criticism of extinguishment of aboriginal title and continued assimilation strategies by attempting to change the indigenous peoples from nations to municipal style government therefore a substantial number of first nations governments consider the current treaty process inadequate and have refused to participatecitation needed a november  court ruling for the xeni gwetin first nation called future participation in the process into question the judge ruled that the xeni gwetin could demonstrate aboriginal title to half of the nemaia valley and that the province had no power over these lands under the bc treaty process negotiating nations have received as little as  of their claimed land recognized grand chief stewart phillip president of the union of bc indian chiefs called the court victory a nail in the coffin of the bc treaty process see alsoedit outline of british columbia

british columbia is the westernmost province of canada originally politically constituted as a pair of british colonies british columbia joined the canadian confederation on july   perhaps the most influential historian of british columbia has been margaret ormsby in british columbia a history  she presented a structural model that has been adopted by numerous historians and teachers chad reimer says in many aspects it still has not been surpassed ormsby posited a series of propositions that provided the dynamic to the history the ongoing pull between maritime and continental forces the opposition between a closed hierarchical model of society represented by the hudsons bay company and colonial officials and the open egalitarian vision of english and canadian settlers and regional

back thousands of years archaeology has identified dates in british columbia as early as  years ago with some exciting potential for underwater sites beginning to be detected the geography of the land influenced cultural development of the peoples  and in places allowed for cultural development of permanent villages complex social institutions and a huge range of languages bc is divided by anthropological theory into three cultural areas  the northwest coast the plateau and the north first nations in each area developed customs and approaches to living that fit the resources in the region through much of british columbia salmon are available and formed a substantial part of the diet where available the term precontact is used to describe the time period prior to contact between first nations and european explorers the precise time of contact varied according to circumstance but took place on the coast between the s and  in places in the interior it occurred later british columbia before the arrival of the europeans was home to many indigenous peoples speaking more than  different languages including babinewitsuwiten danezaa beaver carrier chilcotin gitxsan haida halkomelem kaska kutenai lillooet nisgaa nuuchahnulth nuxalk sekani shuswap sinixt squamish tagish tahltan thompson tlingit tsetsaut and tsimshian there was frequent contact between bands and voyages across the strait of georgia and the strait of juan de fuca were common the abundance of natural resources such as salmon and cedar enabled the development of a complex hierarchical society within coastal communities with so much food being available the peoples of the coastal regions could focus their time on other pursuits such as art politics and warfare early spanish explorersedit the first visitors to presentday british columbia were spanish sailors and other european sailors who sailed for the spanish crown there is some evidence that the greekborn juan de fuca who sailed for spain and explored the west coast of north america in the s might have reached the passageway between washington state and vancouver island—today known as the strait of juan de fuca a later british explorer named charles william barkley named the passage after juan de fucas reputed visit there is not much evidence to suggest that european traders and explorers regularly came to presentday british columbia in the th century the arrival of europeans began to intensify in the midth century as fur traders entered the area to harvest sea otters while there is a theory and some evidence that sir francis drake may have explored the british columbia coast in  it is conventionally claimed that it was juan francisco de la bodega y quadra who completed the first documented voyage which took place in  in doing so quadra reasserted the spanish claim for the whole of the pacific coast first made by vasco núñez de balboa in  who declared the whole of the pacific and its shores as part of the spanish empire in  the spanish navigator juan josé pérez hernández a native of mexico sailed from san blas nueva galicia modernday nayarit with instructions to reach ° north latitude to discover possible russian settlements and take possession of the lands for the spanish crown hernández reached ° north latitude becoming the first european to sight the queen charlotte islands and vancouver island he traded with the natives near estevan point although apparently without landing the expedition was forced to return to nueva galicia due to the lack of provisions since pérez hernándezs first expedition failed to achieve its objective the spanish organized a second expedition in  with the same goal this expedition was commanded by bruno de heceta on board the santiago piloted by pérez hernández and accompanied by juan francisco de la bodega y quadra in la sonora after illnesses storms and other troubles had affected the expedition de heceta returned to nueva galicia while quadra kept on a northward course ultimately reaching ° north in what today is sitka alaska during this expedition the spanish made sure to land several times and formally claim the lands for the spanish crown while verifying the absence of russian settlements along the coast in the following years several other spanish expeditions would set sail from nueva galicia bound for the pacific northwest three years later in  the british royal navy captain james cook arrived in the region searching for the northwest passage and successfully landed at nootka sound on vancouver island where he and his crew traded with the nuuchahnulth first nation upon trading his goods for sea otter pelts his crew in turn traded them for an enormous profit in macau on their way back to britain this led to an influx of traders to the british columbian coast and ongoing economic contact with the aboriginal peoples there early european villages –sedit nootka sound marked in vancouver island reconstruction of fort san miguel friendly cove nootka sound volume i plate vii from a voyage of discovery to the north pacific ocean and round the world by george vancouver in  john meares an english navigator and explorer sailed from china and explored nootka sound and the neighbouring coasts he bought some land from a local chief named maquinna and built a trading post there two years later in  the spanish commander esteban josé martínez a native of seville established a settlement and started building a fort in friendly cove nootka sound which was named fort san miguel this territory was already considered as part of new spain by the spanish due to the previous explorations of the region upon martinezs arrival a number of british ships were seized including those of captain meares this originated the nootka crisis which almost led to a war between britain and spain the controversy resulted in the abandonment of the nootka sound settlement by the spanish some months later manuel antonio flores viceroy of new spain ordered a francisco de eliza to rebuild the fort the expedition composed of three ships the concepción under the command of de eliza the san carlos under the command of salvador fidalgo and the princesa real under the command of manuel quimper sailed in early  from san blas in nueva galicia and arrived at nootka sound in april of that year the expedition had many catalan volunteers from the first free company of volunteers of catalonia commanded by pere dalberní a native of tortosa the expedition rebuilt the fort which had been dismantled after martínez abandoned it the rebuilt fort included several defensive constructions as well as a vegetable garden to ensure the settlement had food supplies the catalan volunteers left the fort in  and spanish influence in the region ended in  after the nootka convention came into force late british expeditions s–edit subsequently european explorermerchants from the east started to discover british columbia three figures dominate in the early history of mainland british columbia sir alexander mackenzie simon fraser and david thompson as employees of the north west company the three were primarily concerned with discovering a practicable river route to the pacific specifically via the columbia river for the extension of the fur trade in  mackenzie became the first european to reach the pacific overland north of the rio grande he and his crew entered the region through the rocky mountains via the peace river reaching the ocean at north bentinck arm near presentday bella coola shortly thereafter mackenzies companion john finlay founded the first permanent european settlement in british columbia fort st john located at the junction of the beatton and peace rivers simon fraser was the next to try to find the course of the columbia during his expedition of  fraser and his crew including john stuart explored much of the british columbia interior establishing several forts hudsons hope trout lake fort fort george fort fraser and fort st james frasers expedition took him down the river that now bears his name to the site of presentday vancouver although both mackenzie and fraser reached the pacific they found the routes they took impassable for trade it was david thompson who found the columbia river and followed it down to its mouth in  he was unable to establish a claim however for the american explorers lewis and clark had already claimed the territory for the united states of america six years earlier the american fur company of john jacob astor had founded fort astoria just months before thompson arrived though within a year the local staff at astoria sold the fort and others in the region to the north west company which renamed it fort george though returned to us hands as a result of treaty complications at the end of the war of  this meant only there was a parallel us fort adjacent to the nwc one which was the more prosperous of the two following the forced merger of the north west company and hudsons bay company in  fort vancouver was established as the new regional headquarters from fur trade districts to colonies –edit although technically a part of british north america british columbia was largely run by the hudsons bay company after its merger with the north west company in  the central interior of the region was organized into the new caledonia district a name that came to be generally attributed to the mainland as a whole it was administered from fort st james about  km northwest of presentday prince george the interior south of the thompson river and north of california was named by the company the columbia district and was administered first from fort vancouver present day vancouver washington throughout the s and s the hbc controlled nearly all trading operations in the pacific northwest based out of the company headquarters at fort vancouver on the columbia river although authority over the region was nominally shared by the united states and britain through the angloamerican convention of  company policy enforced via chief factor john mcloughlin of the companys columbia district was to discourage any settlement including us settlement of the territory the companys effective monopoly on trade virtually forbade any settlement in the region it established fort boise in  in presentday southwestern idaho to compete with the american fort hall  km  mi to the east in  it purchased fort hall also along the route of the oregon trail where the outpost director displayed the abandoned wagons of discouraged settlers to those seeking to move west along the trail fort vancouver was the nexus for the fur trade on the pacific coast its influence reached from the rocky mountains to the hawaiian islands and from alaska into mexicancontrolled california at its pinnacle fort vancouver watched over  outposts  ports six ships and  employees also for many primarily american settlers the fort became the last stop on the oregon trail as they could get supplies before starting their homestead by  the hudsons bay company operated numerous posts in the columbia department including fort vancouver fort george astoria fort nisqually fort umpqua fort langley fort colville fort okanogan fort kamloops fort alexandria flathead post kootanae house fort boise fort hall fort simpson fort taku fort mcloughlin in milbanke sound fort stikine as well as a number of others a very high degree of linguistic variation occurs in bc  a response to this was the development of a trade jargon  chinook jargon not a complete language it was used in trade governance and some early writings for example hymns by  john jacob astor had founded astoria and ten years later the hudsons bay company had established itself on the columbia in the meantime the explorers and traders had been coming by land somewhere and sometime during this period the existence of the chinook jargon became known all the indians talked it to each other and resorted to it in their conversations with the whites knowledge of this trade language became a necessary part of the traders equipment fort victoria was established as a trading post in  both as a means to protect hbc interests as well as to assert british claims to vancouver island and the adjacent gulf islands the gulf islands and strait of juan de fuca are the access point to puget sound as well as a fall back position in preparation for the worst case scenario settlement of the dispute in the face of manifest destiny increasing numbers of american settlers arriving on the oregon trail gave rise to the oregon boundary dispute the hudsons bay company dominated and controlled all territory north of the columbia river the british position was that a fair division of the columbia district was a boundary at the columbia river in  the united states democratic party asserted that the us had a legitimate claim to the entire columbia district or oregon country but president james polk was prepared to draw the border along the th parallel the longstanding us proposal when the british rejected this offer polk broke off negotiations and american expansionists reasserted the claim coining slogans most famously fiftyfour forty or fight with the outbreak of the mexicanamerican war diverting attention and resources polk was again prepared to compromise the oregon boundary dispute was settled in the  treaty of washington the terms of the agreement established the border between british north america and the united states at the th parallel from the rocky mountains to the sea the original american proposal with all of vancouver island retained as british territory this effectively destroyed the geographical logic of the hbcs columbia department since the lower columbia river was the core and lifeline of the system the us soon organized its portion as the oregon territory the administrative headquarters of fur operations and of the columbia department then shifted north to fort victoria which had been founded by james douglas in  the crown colony of vancouver island was created and in  james douglas was appointed governor douglas known as the father of british columbia established colonial institutions in victoria he started the process of expanding the economic base of the new colony by signing  treaties between  to purchase land for settlement and industrial development coal deposits were known by the hwbc in the vicinities of nanaimo and fort rupert subsequent native population crashes later in the th century along with economic upheaval and native wars allowed his political successors to be much less consistent with british principles treaties and laws meanwhile on the mainland new caledonia continued to focus on the fur trade with few nonnative inhabitants mostly hbc employees and their familiescitation needed under the administrative oversight of douglas who was also the hbcs regional chief executive the hudsons bay company like the previous french colony and north west company of montreal still officially discouraged settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade the fur trade was a mutually beneficial relationship between the local hbc trading fort and adjacent native tribes american expansion and control of territory was predicated primarily by settlement of the land not commercial relationships with the existing local population the british made virtually no effort to assert sovereignty over the aboriginal peoples of

fort langley burgeoned economically as the staging point for many of the prospectors heading by boat to the canyon a wide range of linguistic diversity among first nations and explorerstraders made communication difficult trade jargon initially used by first nations expanded and changed to include words from english and french to become the chinook jargon not a complete language the jargon

early anthropologists sometimes recorded stories using the jargon at the time the region was still not under formal colonial authority douglas fearing challenges to the claim of british sovereignty in

richard clement moody and the royal engineersedit when news of the fraser canyon gold rush reached london the colonial office established the mainland as a crown colony on august   naming it the colony of british columbia richard clement moody was handpicked by the colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia – into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and “found a second england on the shores of the pacific” lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force’ he sought men who possessed ‘courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world’ and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the archetypal english gentleman and british officer’ at the head of the columbia detachment which was created by an act of the british parliament on  august  the engineers were believed to exemplify the qualities sought by the government col richard moody commander of the columbia detachment moody arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary and the two became close friends ned mcgowans waredit moody had hoped to begin immediately the foundation of a capital city but upon his arrival at fort langley he learned of an outbreak of violence at the settlement of hills bar this led to an incident popularly known as ned mcgowans war where moody led  engineers and judge matthew baillie begbie to yale to face down a group of rebellious american miners order was restored without further strict pain  the foundation of new westminsteredit in british columbia moody ‘wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness’ and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance ‘styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe’ subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending miles to the right  left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities  yet fr the background of superb mountains swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody likened his vision of the nascent colony of british columbia to the pastoral scenes painted by aelbert cuyp moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town’ and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuous hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled’ the feud between moody and governor james douglasedit throughout his tenure in british columbia richard clement moody was engaged in a bitter feud with sir james douglas governor of vancouver island whose jurisdiction overlapped with his own moody’s position as chief commissioner and lieutenantgovernor was one of ‘higher prestige and lesser authority than that of douglas despite moodys vastly superior social position in the eyes of the engineers and the british government moody had been selected by lord lytton due to his possession of the quality of the archetypal english gentleman and british officer his family was eminently respectable he was the son of colonel thomas moody  one of the wealthiest mercantilists in the west indies who owned much of the land in the islands where douglass father owned a small amount of land and from which douglass mother a halfbreed originated governor douglass ethnicity and made him ‘an affront to victorian society’ mary moody the descendant of the hawks industrial dynasty and the boyd merchant banking family wrote on  august  it is not pleasant to serve under a hudsons bay factor and that the governor and richard can never get on in letter to the colonial office of  december  richard clement moody boasts that he has ‘entirely disarmed douglas of all jealously douglas repeatedly insulted the engineers by attempting to assume their command and refusing to acknowledge their value in the nascent colony margaret a ormsby author of the dictionary of canadian biography entry for moody  condemns moody for a contribution to the abortive development of the city however most other historians have exonerated moody for the abortive development of the city and consider his achievement to be impressive especially with regard to the perpetual insufficiency of funds and the personally motivated opposition of douglas whose opposition to the project continually retarded its development robert edgar cail don w thomson ishiguro and scott have praised moody for his contribution the latter accusing ormsby of being ‘adamant in her dislike of colonel moody’ despite the evidence and almost all biographies of moody including those of the institute of civil engineers the royal engineers and the british columbia historical association are flattering other developmentsedit moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbing port moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor frederick seymour second governor of the colony of british columbia and his cat royal engineers columbia detachment was disbanded in july  the moody family only  men and  wives returned to england while the rest  sappers elected to remain in bc scott contends that the departure of the engineers doomed the development of the settlement and the fruition of lord lyttons dream chartres brew replaced moody as land commissioner the second gold rushedit a second major gold rush in the cariboo region of the colony occurred in  in the midst of smaller ones notably in the omenica big bend and on the stikine the influx of gold miners into bcs economy led to the creation of basic infrastructure in bc most notably the creation of the cariboo wagon road which linked the lower mainland to the rich gold fields of barkerville however the enormous costs of the road and its predecessor the douglas road and services such as the gold escort left bc in debt by the mids in  because of the massive debt leftover from the gold rush the mainland and vancouver island became one colony named british columbia with its capital in victoria on vancouver island settlement and industrial development took place along the shorelines for example see the th century settlement in comox or colony of vancouver island annexation debateedit in  there were three options open to continue as a british colony to be annexed by the united states or to confederate with the newly formed dominion of canada in britain many little englanders expected or even hoped that its north american colonies would depart from the british empire admiral joseph denman told the admiralty that british columbia did not deserve royal navy protection and advised the british government to divest herself of these possessions by any means consistent with honour secretary of state for the colonies lord granville stated his wish that british north america would propose to be independent and annex themselves the times view was the british consensus british columbia is a long way off  with the exception of a limited official class it receives few immigrants from england and a large proportion of its inhabitants consists of citizens of the united states who have entered it from the south suppose that the colonists met together and came to the conclusion that every natural motive of contiguity similarity of interests and facility of administration induced them to think it more convenient to slip into the union than into the dominion  we all know that we should not attempt to withstand them financially becoming officially part of the united states made sense since british columbia was economically essentially a satellite of san francisco—the most important city of the entire american west and north americas pacific coast—washington and oregon which provided all of the colonys supplies despite a substantial american tariff american currency circulated widely in the colony whose nearest british neighbors were red river  miles to the east and hong kong to the west san franciscos population in the s exceeded  while victorias never rose above  all mail from british columbia went through san francisco forcing the colonys post office to keep large amounts of american postage stamps– the opening of the american transcontinental railroad in  made it possible to travel by ship from victoria to san francisco then by train to ottawa or washington in just  days with the gold now gone most of the american miners had left and the economic future did not look promising unless bc could join the very rapidly growing rich economies of the pacific states while american residents of british columbia celebrated the united states purchase of alaska in  having american territory to their north and south caused british residents fears for the future of their colony to grow alaska was part of american secretary of state william h sewards plan to incorporate the entire northwest pacific coast chiefly for the longterm commercial advantages to the united states in terms of pacific trade seward believed that the people in british columbia wanted annexation and that britain would accept this in exchange for the alabama claims in the event seward dropped the idea of an exchange and accepted an arbitration plan that settled the alabama claims for cash when a false report circulated in april soon after the alaska news that the british government was considering settling the claims by ceding the colony a substantial annexation movement appeared supported by many residents and three of the colonys six newspapers anticonfederationists who were not necessarily annexationists were the majority on vancouver island that said annexationists argued that the colony would never be able to negotiate with the united states a free trade agreement similar to the reciprocity treaty of  and that annexation would end the disadvantage of the american tariff most canadianborn residents supported confederation with their land of origin but were not very popular as many in the colony believed that they sent their money home instead of spending it in british columbia as the americanborn colonists did residents of the mainland almost unanimously supported confederation with the rest of british north america they argued that this would benefit the colony as canada would soon negotiate another reciprocity treaty many britishborn colonists were on both sides–– representative nathaniel p banks of massachusetts annexation bill of  offered voluntary annexation to british north america including territorial status for vancouver island and british columbia together as the territory of columbia the bill was unsuccessful as was senator alexander ramsey of minnesotas  proposal that the united states as part of another reciprocity treaty with canada offer  million to the hudsons bay company for the territory west of the th longitude the us would assume british columbias  million debt and subsidize the northern pacific railway to build a road to puget sound– two american military officers who travelled throughout british columbia for two months while arranging for supply of occupation troops in alaska wrote a detailed report to washington in november  of their belief that a majority of residents supported annexation they claimed that it did not become necessary in a single instance to broach the subject of the cession of that territory to the united states for it was the constant theme of conversation employees of the hudsons bay company were said to be especially supportive although they and many others could not make their opinion public because of fears of being denounced as disloyal a majority of british columbians never publicly supported american annexation however and support for joining canada grew over time in particular annexationists failed to persuade the anticonfederation hudsons bay company officials and their friends that dominated vancouver island politics accusations that american gold and american greenbacks funded renegade englishmen likely hurt annexation support whether the us officers belief of the existence of widespread covert support was correct by october  annexation no longer appeared as a topic in british columbia newspapers or documents until the alaska purchase and the new dominion status which were almost simultaneous the british had been indifferent to the fate of british columbia london now paid attention and realized the value of bc as a base for its imperial trade opportunities in the pacific and the need of the royal navy for a station in the region by  public opinion was likely on the confederation side annexationists or at least anticonfederationists were in control of the legislative council of british columbia however and in february  passed a resolution opposing confederation until his death the colonial governor frederick seymour also opposed confederation successor anthony musgrave supported confederation after being unsuccessful in bringing newfoundland into canada but due to an accident was delayed in his duties meanwhile annexation support revived during the winter of  one hundred four individuals about one percent of the white population of the colony signed an  petition to president ulysses s grant asking for annexation while there is no reason to believe that they accurately represented the majority opinion it is true that many colonists viewed washington and london as equal competitors for british columbias loyalty depending on who offered more incentives while ottawa was more foreign and less familiar– in august  lord granville communicated londons new view of british columbia when he wrote to musgrave i have no hesitation in stating that support of confederation is also the opinion of her majestys government in february  musgrave successfully persuaded the legislative council to pass a resolution supporting confederation with canada many britishborn colonists now supported confederation as the best way to maintain a connection with britain by april the victoria colonist reported that a mass meeting in victoria supported confederation while the most vague hint in the direction of annexation was met with a howl of execration musgrave proposed an attractive plan for joining canada with the dominion assuming the colonys debt and building a new canadian transcontinental railway that would eliminate the reliance on the american railroad meanwhile the united states was so focused on issues of reconstruction that few americans picked up on sewards grand dream to expand manifest destiny to the pacific entry into canada –edit see also british columbia § rapid growth and development  map of british columbia showing federal electoral districts a map produced in london in  to facilitate emigration to british columbia showing the natural resources of the new province both the depressed economic situation arising from the collapse of the gold rushes as well as a desire for the establishment of truly responsible and representative government led to enormous domestic pressure for british columbia to join the canadian confederation which had been proclaimed in  the confederation league spearheaded by three future premiers of the province — amor de cosmos robert beaven and john robson — took a leading role in pushing the colony towards this goal and so it was on july   that british columbia became the sixth province to join canada in return for entering confederation canada absorbed bcs massive debt and promised to build a railway from montreal to the pacific coast within  years contrary to popular belief british columbia did not demand a transcontinental railroad as a condition of confederation its delegates expected a wagon road but john a macdonalds national government proposed the railroad as a substitute with ottawa and london viewing it as a way of connecting not just british columbia but the prairies with the rest of the british empire– the promise of a railroad became however the most important reason for british columbia to stay within canada the provincial legislature threatened to secede in  because macdonalds successor alexander mackenzie whose liberal party had opposed the railroad attempted to modify the promise macdonalds return to power that year likely kept british columbia from departing canada– in fulfillment of the promise the last spike of the canadian pacific railway was driven in craigellachie on  november  no good road yet existed between british columbia and other provinces until the completion of the transcanada highway automobiles had to enter the united states to travel to eastern canada– the mining frontier in bc led to the creation of many mines and smelters mostly through american investment one of the worlds largest smelters still exists today in trail the capital and work to be found in bc during the turn of the th century to the th century led to the creation of several new towns in bc such as nelson nakusp slocan kimberley castlegar rossland and salmo a large coal empire run by robert dunsmuir and his son and later premier james dunsmuir also developed on vancouver island during this era as the economy on the mainland continued to improve as a result of improved transportation and increased settlement other resourcebased economic activity began to flourish throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century fishing forestry and farming including the planting of extensive orchards in the okanagan region became the three fs on which the new province built its economy — a situation that persisted well into the late twentieth century with the booming economy came the expansion of the original fur trading posts into thriving communities such as victoria nanaimo and kamloops it also led to the establishment of new communities such as yale new westminster and — most notably though a latecomer — vancouver the product of the consolidation of the burgeoning mill towns of granville and hastings mill located near the mouth of the fraser on burrard inlet in the later s vancouver was incorporated in  following its selection as the railhead for the canadian pacific railway despite a devastating fire which all but wiped out the city three months later vancouver quickly became the largest city in the province its ports conveying both the resource wealth of the province as well as that transported from the prairie provinces by rail to markets overseas vancouvers status as the principal city in the province has endured augmented by growth in the surrounding municipalities of richmond

strike occurred following the death of another labour leader ginger goodwin in  at the cumberland coal mines on vancouver island a lull in industrial tensions through the later s came to an abrupt end with the great depression most of the s strikes were led by communist party organizers that strike wave peaked in  when unemployed men flooded the city to protest conditions in the relief camps run by the military in remote areas throughout the province after two tense months of daily and disruptive protesting the relief camp strikers decided to take their grievances to the federal government and

under the doctrine of terra nullius with few exceptions the douglas treaties of fort rupert and southern vancouver island no treaties were signed some early settlers assumed based on the catastrophic population crash of first nations peoples linked to smallpox and racist ideas that indians were a dying race led to a lack of action to deal with what was then termed the indian land question upon confederation the federal government assumed responsibility for indians and lands reserved for indians while the province had responsibility for nonaboriginal civil matters and resources the  mckennamcbride royal commission made some amendments to lands but failed to deal with issues pertaining to title and first nations rights several delegations to ottawa and london were sent by first nations seeking redress for grievances to little avail instead the indian act federal legislation governing first nations was amended to make it a crime to organize or engage legal council other oppressive measure also accompanied the amendment including the potlatch ban and the increasingly applied indian residential school system designed to assimilate first nations the status of the first nations aboriginal people of british columbia is a longstanding problem that has become a major issue in recent years first nations were confined to tiny reserves that no longer provide an economic base they were provided with inadequate education and discriminated against in numerous ways in many areas they were excluded from restaurants and other establishments status indians gained the right to vote in  they were prohibited from possessing alcohol which rather than preventing problems with this drug exacerbated them by fostering unhealthy patterns of consumption such as binge drinkingcitation needed certain privileges of status indians are governed by the indian act with the exception of what are known as the douglas treaties negotiated by sir james douglas with the native people of the victoria area no treaties were signed in british columbia until  many native people wished to negotiate treaties but the province refused until  another major development was the  decision of the supreme court of canada in the delgamuukw v british columbia case that aboriginal title still exists in british columbia  of first nations in british columbia are aligned with the first nations summit this brings a total of  first nations but only  are said to be in active negotiations three final agreements have been settled with one being rejected by lheidli tenneh in  the

tsawwassen first nation treaty claiming infringement on their rights and land titles on the west coast of vancouver island the ditidaht first nation is doing the same against the maanulth treaty group the only treaty signed in recent years the nisgaa treaty  was negotiated outside of the current treaty process there is considerable disagreement about treaty negotiations among indigenous people there is mounting criticism of extinguishment of aboriginal title and continued assimilation strategies by attempting to change the indigenous peoples from nations to municipal style government therefore a substantial number of first nations governments consider the current treaty process inadequate and have refused to participatecitation needed a november  court ruling for the xeni gwetin

and in places allowed for cultural development of permanent villages complex social institutions and a huge range of languages bc is divided by anthropological theory into three cultural areas  the northwest coast the plateau and the north first nations in each area developed customs and approaches to living that fit the resources in the region through much of british columbia salmon are available and formed a substantial part of the diet where available the term precontact is used to describe the time period prior to contact between first nations and european explorers the precise time of contact varied according to circumstance but took place on the coast between the s and  in places in the interior it occurred later british columbia before the arrival of the europeans was home to many indigenous peoples speaking more than  different languages including babinewitsuwiten danezaa beaver carrier chilcotin gitxsan haida halkomelem kaska kutenai lillooet nisgaa nuuchahnulth nuxalk sekani shuswap sinixt squamish tagish tahltan thompson tlingit tsetsaut and tsimshian there was frequent contact between bands and voyages across the strait of georgia and the strait of juan de fuca were common the abundance of natural resources such as salmon and cedar enabled the development of a complex hierarchical society within coastal communities with so much food being available the peoples of the coastal regions could focus their time on other pursuits such as art politics and warfare early spanish explorersedit the first visitors to presentday british columbia were spanish sailors and other european sailors who sailed for the spanish crown there is some evidence that the greekborn juan de fuca who sailed for spain and explored the west coast of north america in the s might have reached the passageway between washington state and vancouver island—today known as the strait of juan de fuca a later british explorer named charles william barkley named the passage after juan de fucas reputed visit there is not much evidence to suggest that european traders and explorers regularly came to presentday british columbia in the th century the arrival of europeans began to intensify in the midth century as fur traders entered the area to harvest sea otters while there is a theory and some evidence that sir francis drake may have explored the british columbia coast in  it is conventionally claimed that it was juan francisco de la bodega y quadra who completed the first documented voyage which took place in  in doing so quadra reasserted the spanish claim for the whole of the pacific coast first made by vasco núñez de balboa in  who declared the whole of the pacific and its shores as part of the spanish empire in  the spanish navigator juan josé pérez hernández a native of mexico sailed from san blas nueva galicia modernday nayarit with instructions to reach ° north latitude to discover possible russian settlements and take possession of the lands for the spanish crown hernández reached ° north latitude becoming the first european to sight the queen charlotte islands and vancouver island he traded with the natives near estevan point although apparently without landing the expedition was forced to return to nueva galicia due to the lack of provisions since pérez hernándezs first expedition failed to achieve its objective the spanish organized a second expedition in  with the same goal this expedition was commanded by bruno de heceta on board the santiago piloted by pérez hernández and accompanied by juan francisco de la bodega y quadra in la sonora after illnesses storms and other troubles had affected the expedition de heceta returned to nueva galicia while quadra kept on a northward course ultimately reaching ° north in what today is sitka alaska during this expedition the spanish made sure to land several times and formally claim the lands for the spanish crown while verifying the absence of russian settlements along the coast in the following years several other spanish expeditions would set sail from nueva galicia bound for the pacific northwest three years later in  the british royal navy captain james cook arrived in the region searching for the northwest passage and successfully landed at nootka sound on vancouver island where he and his crew traded with the nuuchahnulth first nation upon trading his goods for sea otter pelts his crew in turn traded them for an enormous profit in macau on their way back to britain this led to an influx of traders to the british columbian coast and ongoing economic contact with the aboriginal peoples there early european villages –sedit nootka sound marked in vancouver island reconstruction of fort san miguel friendly cove nootka sound volume i plate vii from a voyage of discovery to the north pacific ocean and round the world by george vancouver in  john meares an english navigator and explorer sailed from china and explored nootka sound and the neighbouring coasts he bought some land from a local chief named maquinna and built a trading post there two years later in  the spanish commander esteban josé martínez a native of seville established a settlement and started building a fort in friendly cove nootka sound which was named fort san miguel this territory was already considered as part of new spain by the spanish due to the previous explorations of the region upon martinezs arrival a number of british ships were seized including those of captain meares this originated the nootka crisis which almost led to a war between britain and spain the controversy resulted in the abandonment of the nootka sound settlement by the spanish some months later manuel antonio flores viceroy of new spain ordered a francisco de eliza to rebuild the fort the expedition composed of three ships the concepción under the command of de eliza the san carlos under the command of salvador fidalgo and the princesa real under the command of manuel quimper sailed in early  from san blas in nueva galicia and arrived at nootka sound in april of that year the expedition had many catalan volunteers from the first free company of volunteers of catalonia commanded by pere dalberní a native of tortosa the expedition rebuilt the fort which had been dismantled after martínez abandoned it the rebuilt fort included several defensive constructions as well as a vegetable garden to ensure the settlement had food supplies the catalan volunteers left the fort in  and spanish influence in the region ended in  after the nootka convention came into force late british expeditions s–edit subsequently european explorermerchants from the east started to discover british columbia three figures dominate in the early history of mainland british columbia sir alexander mackenzie simon fraser and david thompson as employees of the north west company the three were primarily concerned with discovering a practicable river route to the pacific specifically via the columbia river for the extension of the fur trade in  mackenzie became the first european to reach the pacific overland north of the rio grande he and his crew entered the region through the rocky mountains via the peace river reaching the ocean at north bentinck arm near presentday bella coola shortly thereafter mackenzies companion john finlay founded the first permanent european settlement in british columbia fort st john located at the junction of the beatton and peace rivers simon fraser was the next to try to find the course of the columbia during his expedition of  fraser and his crew including john stuart explored much of the british columbia interior establishing several forts hudsons hope trout lake fort fort george fort fraser and fort st james frasers expedition took him down the river that now bears his name to the site of presentday vancouver although both mackenzie and fraser reached the pacific they found the routes they took impassable for trade it was david thompson who found the columbia river and followed it down to its mouth in  he was unable to establish a claim however for the american explorers lewis and clark had already claimed the territory for the united states of america six years earlier the american fur company of john jacob astor had founded fort astoria just months before thompson arrived though within a year the local staff at astoria sold the fort and others in the region to the north west company which renamed it fort george though returned to us hands as a result of treaty complications at the end of the war of  this meant only there was a parallel us fort adjacent to the nwc one which was the more prosperous of the two following the forced merger of the north west company and hudsons bay company in  fort vancouver was established as the new regional headquarters from fur trade districts to colonies –edit although technically a part of british north america british columbia was largely run by the hudsons bay company after its merger with the north west company in  the central interior of the region was organized into the new caledonia district a name that came to be generally attributed to the mainland as a whole it was administered from fort st james about  km northwest of presentday prince george the interior south of the thompson river and north of california was named by the company the columbia district and was administered first from fort vancouver present day vancouver washington throughout the s and s the hbc controlled nearly all trading operations in the pacific northwest based out of the company headquarters at fort vancouver on the columbia river although authority over the region was nominally shared by the united states and britain through the angloamerican convention of  company policy enforced via chief factor john mcloughlin of the companys columbia district was to discourage any settlement including us settlement of the territory the companys effective monopoly on trade virtually forbade any settlement in the region it established fort boise in  in presentday southwestern idaho to compete with the american fort hall  km  mi to the east in  it purchased fort hall also along the route of the oregon trail where the outpost director displayed the abandoned wagons of discouraged settlers to those seeking to move west along the trail fort vancouver was the nexus for the fur trade on the pacific coast its influence reached from the rocky mountains to the hawaiian islands and from alaska into mexicancontrolled california at its pinnacle fort vancouver watched over  outposts  ports six ships and  employees also for many primarily american settlers the fort became the last stop on the oregon trail as they could get supplies before starting their homestead by  the hudsons bay company operated numerous posts in the columbia department including fort vancouver fort george astoria fort nisqually fort umpqua fort langley fort colville fort okanogan fort kamloops fort alexandria flathead post kootanae house fort boise fort hall fort simpson fort taku fort mcloughlin in milbanke sound fort stikine as well as a number of others a very high degree of linguistic variation occurs in bc  a response to this was the development of a trade jargon  chinook jargon not a complete language it was used in trade governance and some early writings for example hymns by  john jacob astor had founded astoria and ten years later the hudsons bay company had established itself on the columbia in the meantime the explorers and traders had been coming by land somewhere and sometime during this period the existence of the chinook jargon became known all the indians talked it to each other and resorted to it in their conversations with the whites knowledge of this trade language became a necessary part of the traders equipment fort victoria was established as a trading post in  both as a means to protect hbc interests as well as to assert british claims to vancouver island and the adjacent gulf islands the gulf islands and strait of juan de fuca are the access point to puget sound as well as a fall back position in preparation for the worst case scenario settlement of the dispute in the face of manifest destiny increasing numbers of american settlers arriving on the oregon trail gave rise to the oregon boundary dispute the hudsons bay company dominated and controlled all territory north of the columbia river the british position was that a fair division of the columbia district was a boundary at the columbia river in  the united states democratic party asserted that the us had a legitimate claim to the entire columbia district or oregon country but president james polk was prepared to draw the border along the th parallel the longstanding us proposal when the british rejected this offer polk broke off negotiations and american expansionists reasserted the claim coining slogans most famously fiftyfour forty or fight with the outbreak of the mexicanamerican war diverting attention and resources polk was again prepared to compromise the oregon boundary dispute was settled in the  treaty of washington the terms of the agreement established the border between british north america and the united states at the th parallel from the rocky mountains to the sea the original american proposal with all of vancouver island retained as british territory this effectively destroyed the geographical logic of the hbcs columbia department since the lower columbia river was the core and lifeline of the system the us soon organized its portion as the oregon territory the administrative headquarters of fur operations and of the columbia department then shifted north to fort victoria which had been founded by james douglas in  the crown colony of vancouver island was created and in  james douglas was appointed governor douglas known as the father of british columbia established colonial institutions in victoria he started the process of expanding the economic base of the new colony by signing  treaties between  to purchase land for settlement and industrial development coal deposits were known by the hwbc in the vicinities of nanaimo and fort rupert subsequent native population crashes later in the th century along with economic upheaval and native wars allowed his political successors to be much less consistent with british principles treaties and laws meanwhile on the mainland new caledonia continued to focus on the fur trade with few nonnative inhabitants mostly hbc employees and their familiescitation needed under the administrative oversight of douglas who was also the hbcs regional chief executive the hudsons bay company like the previous french colony and north west company of montreal still officially discouraged settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade the fur trade was a mutually beneficial relationship between the local hbc trading fort and adjacent native tribes american expansion and control of territory was predicated primarily by settlement of the land not commercial relationships with the existing local population the british made virtually no effort to assert sovereignty over the aboriginal peoples of the area in accordance with the royal proclamation of  largescale settlement by nonaboriginal people was prohibited until the lands were surrendered by treaty colonial british columbia –edit in  gold was found along the banks of the thompson river just east of what is now lytton british columbia triggering the fraser canyon gold rush when word got out to san francisco about gold in british territory victoria was transformed overnight into a tent city as prospectors speculators land agents and outfitters flooded in from around the world mostly via san francisco the hudsons bay companys fort langley burgeoned economically as the staging point for many of the prospectors heading by boat to the canyon a wide range of linguistic diversity among first nations and explorerstraders made communication difficult trade jargon initially used by first nations expanded and changed to include words from english and french to become the chinook jargon not a complete language the jargon became widespread among first nations and early europeans to enable communication and trade though little used today a significant number of place names in british columbia deprive from chinook and early anthropologists sometimes recorded stories using the jargon at the time the region was still not under formal colonial authority douglas fearing challenges to the claim of british sovereignty in the region in the face of an influx of some  americans stationed a gunboat at the mouth of the fraser in order to obtain license fees from those seeking to head upstream the resolution of the oregon boundary dispute whereby british interests primarily the hbc lost governance of all territory between the th parallel and the columbia river due to a sudden influx of american settlers  years previous richard clement moody and the royal engineersedit when news of the fraser canyon gold rush reached london the colonial office established the mainland as a crown colony on august   naming it the colony of british columbia richard clement moody was handpicked by the colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia – into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and “found a second england on the shores of the pacific” lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force’ he sought men who possessed ‘courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world’ and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the archetypal english gentleman and british officer’ at the head of the columbia detachment which was created by an act of the british parliament on  august  the engineers were believed to exemplify the qualities sought by the government col richard moody commander of the columbia detachment moody arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary and the two became close friends ned mcgowans waredit moody had hoped to begin immediately the foundation of a capital city but upon his arrival at fort langley he learned of an outbreak of violence at the settlement of hills bar this led to an incident popularly known as ned mcgowans war where moody led  engineers and judge matthew baillie begbie to yale to face down a group of rebellious american miners order was restored without further strict pain  the foundation of new westminsteredit in british columbia moody ‘wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness’ and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance ‘styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe’ subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending miles to the right  left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities  yet fr the background of superb mountains swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody likened his vision of the nascent colony of british columbia to the pastoral scenes painted by aelbert cuyp moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town’ and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuous hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled’ the feud between moody and governor james douglasedit throughout his tenure in british columbia richard clement moody was engaged in a bitter feud with sir james douglas governor of vancouver island whose jurisdiction overlapped with his own moody’s position as chief commissioner and lieutenantgovernor was one of ‘higher prestige and lesser authority than that of douglas despite moodys vastly superior social position in the eyes of the engineers and the british government moody had been selected by lord lytton due to his possession of the quality of the archetypal english gentleman and british officer his family was eminently respectable he was the son of colonel thomas moody  one of the wealthiest mercantilists in the west indies who owned much of the land in the islands where douglass father owned a small amount of land and from which douglass mother a halfbreed originated governor douglass ethnicity and made him ‘an affront to victorian society’ mary moody the descendant of the hawks industrial dynasty and the boyd merchant banking family wrote on  august  it is not pleasant to serve under a hudsons bay factor and that the governor and richard can never get on in letter to the colonial office of  december  richard clement moody boasts that he has ‘entirely disarmed douglas of all jealously douglas repeatedly insulted the engineers by attempting to assume their command and refusing to acknowledge their value in the nascent colony margaret a ormsby author of the dictionary of canadian biography entry for moody  condemns moody for a contribution to the abortive development of the city however most other historians have exonerated moody for the abortive development of the city and consider his achievement to be impressive especially with regard to the perpetual insufficiency of funds and the personally motivated opposition of douglas whose opposition to the project continually retarded its development robert edgar cail don w thomson ishiguro and scott have praised moody for his contribution the latter accusing ormsby of being ‘adamant in her dislike of colonel moody’ despite the evidence and almost all biographies of moody including those of the institute of civil engineers the royal engineers and the british columbia historical association are flattering other developmentsedit moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbing port moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor frederick seymour second governor of the colony of british columbia and his cat royal engineers columbia detachment was disbanded in july  the moody family only  men and  wives returned to england while the rest  sappers elected to remain in bc scott contends that the departure of the engineers doomed the development of the settlement and the fruition of lord lyttons dream chartres brew replaced moody as land commissioner the second gold rushedit a second major gold rush in the cariboo region of the colony occurred in  in the midst of smaller ones notably in the omenica big bend and on the stikine the influx of gold miners into bcs economy led to the creation of basic infrastructure in bc most notably the creation of the cariboo wagon road which linked the lower mainland to the rich gold fields of barkerville however the enormous costs of the road and its predecessor the douglas road and services such as the gold escort left bc in debt by the mids in  because of the massive debt leftover from the gold rush the mainland and vancouver island became one colony named british columbia with its capital in victoria on vancouver island settlement and industrial development took place along the shorelines for example see the th century settlement in comox or colony of vancouver island annexation debateedit in  there were three options open to continue as a british colony to be annexed by the united states or to confederate with the newly formed dominion of canada in britain many little englanders expected or even hoped that its north american colonies would depart from the british empire admiral joseph denman told the admiralty that british columbia did not deserve royal navy protection and advised the british government to divest herself of these possessions by any means consistent with honour secretary of state for the colonies lord granville stated his wish that british north america would propose to be independent and annex themselves the times view was the british consensus british columbia is a long way off  with the exception of a limited official class it receives few immigrants from england and a large proportion of its inhabitants consists of citizens of the united states who have entered it from the south suppose that the colonists met together and came to the conclusion that every natural motive of contiguity similarity of interests and facility of administration induced them to think it more convenient to slip into the union than into the dominion  we all know that we should not attempt to withstand them financially becoming officially part of the united states made sense since british columbia was economically essentially a satellite of san francisco—the most important city of the entire american west and north americas pacific coast—washington and oregon which provided all of the colonys supplies despite a substantial american tariff american currency circulated widely in the colony whose nearest british neighbors were red river  miles to the east and hong kong to the west san franciscos population in the s exceeded  while victorias never rose above  all mail from british columbia went through san francisco forcing the colonys post office to keep large amounts of american postage stamps– the opening of the american transcontinental railroad in  made it possible to travel by ship from victoria to san francisco then by train to ottawa or washington in just  days with the gold now gone most of the american miners had left and the economic future did not look promising unless bc could join the very rapidly growing rich economies of the pacific states while american residents of british columbia celebrated the united states purchase of alaska in  having american territory to their north and south caused british residents fears for the future of their colony to grow alaska was part of american secretary of state william h sewards plan to incorporate the entire northwest pacific coast chiefly for the longterm commercial advantages to the united states in terms of pacific trade seward believed that the people in british columbia wanted annexation and that britain would accept this in exchange for the alabama claims in the event seward dropped the idea of an exchange and accepted an arbitration plan that settled the alabama claims for cash when a false report circulated in april soon after the alaska news that the british government was considering settling the claims by ceding the colony a substantial annexation movement appeared supported by many residents and three of the colonys six newspapers anticonfederationists who were not necessarily annexationists were the majority on vancouver island that said annexationists argued that the colony would never be able to negotiate with the united states a free trade agreement similar to the reciprocity treaty of  and that annexation would end the disadvantage of the american tariff most canadianborn residents supported confederation with their land of origin but were not very popular as many in the colony believed that they sent their money home instead of spending it in british columbia as the americanborn colonists did residents of the mainland almost unanimously supported confederation with the rest of british north america they argued that this would benefit the colony as canada would soon negotiate another reciprocity treaty many britishborn colonists were on both sides–– representative nathaniel p banks of massachusetts annexation bill of  offered voluntary annexation to british north america including territorial status for vancouver island and british columbia together as the territory of columbia the bill was unsuccessful as was senator alexander ramsey of minnesotas  proposal that the united states as part of another reciprocity treaty with canada offer  million to the hudsons bay company for the territory west of the th longitude the us would assume british columbias  million debt and subsidize the northern pacific railway to build a road to puget sound– two american military officers who travelled throughout british columbia for two months while arranging for supply of occupation troops in alaska wrote a detailed report to washington in november  of their belief that a majority of residents supported annexation they claimed that it did not become necessary in a single instance to broach the subject of the cession of that territory to the united states for it was the constant theme of conversation employees of the hudsons bay company were said to be especially supportive although they and many others could not make their opinion public because of fears of being denounced as disloyal a majority of british columbians never publicly supported american annexation however and support for joining canada grew over time in particular annexationists failed to persuade the anticonfederation hudsons bay company officials and their friends that dominated vancouver island politics accusations that american gold and american greenbacks funded renegade englishmen likely hurt annexation support whether the us officers belief of the existence of widespread covert support was correct by october  annexation no longer appeared as a topic in british columbia newspapers or documents until the alaska purchase and the new dominion status which were almost simultaneous the british had been indifferent to the fate of british columbia london now paid attention and realized the value of bc as a base for its imperial trade opportunities in the pacific and the need of the royal navy for a station in the region by  public opinion was likely on the confederation side annexationists or at least anticonfederationists were in control of the legislative council of british columbia however and in february  passed a resolution opposing confederation until his death the colonial governor frederick seymour also opposed confederation successor anthony musgrave supported confederation after being unsuccessful in bringing newfoundland into canada but due to an accident was delayed in his duties meanwhile annexation support revived during the winter of  one hundred four individuals about one percent of the white population of the colony signed an  petition to president ulysses s grant asking for annexation while there is no reason to believe that they accurately represented the majority opinion it is true that many colonists viewed washington and london as equal competitors for british columbias loyalty depending on who offered more incentives while ottawa was more foreign and less familiar– in august  lord granville communicated londons new view of british columbia when he wrote to musgrave i have no hesitation in stating that support of confederation is also the opinion of her majestys government in february  musgrave successfully persuaded the legislative council to pass a resolution supporting confederation with canada many britishborn colonists now supported confederation as the best way to maintain a connection with britain by april the victoria colonist reported that a mass meeting in victoria supported confederation while the most vague hint in the direction of annexation was met with a howl of execration musgrave proposed an attractive plan for joining canada with the dominion assuming the colonys debt and building a new canadian transcontinental railway that would eliminate the reliance on the american railroad meanwhile the united states was so focused on issues of reconstruction that few americans picked up on sewards grand dream to expand manifest destiny to the pacific entry into canada –edit see also british columbia § rapid growth and development  map of british columbia showing federal electoral districts a map produced in london in  to facilitate emigration to british columbia showing the natural resources of the new province both the depressed economic situation arising from the collapse of the gold rushes as well as a desire for the establishment of truly responsible and representative government led to enormous domestic pressure for british columbia to join the canadian confederation which had been proclaimed in  the confederation league spearheaded by three future premiers of the province — amor de cosmos robert beaven and john robson — took a leading role in pushing the colony towards this goal and so it was on july   that british columbia became the sixth province to join canada in return for entering confederation canada absorbed bcs massive debt and promised to build a railway from montreal to the pacific coast within  years contrary to popular belief british columbia did not demand a transcontinental railroad as a condition of confederation its delegates expected a wagon road but john a macdonalds national government proposed the railroad as a substitute with ottawa and london viewing it as a way of connecting not just british columbia but the prairies with the rest of the british empire– the promise of a railroad became however the most important reason for british columbia to stay within canada the provincial legislature threatened to secede in  because macdonalds successor alexander mackenzie whose liberal party had opposed the railroad attempted to modify the promise macdonalds return to power that year likely kept british columbia from departing canada– in fulfillment of the promise the last spike of the canadian pacific railway was driven in craigellachie on  november  no good road yet existed between british columbia and other provinces until the completion of the transcanada highway automobiles had to enter the united states to travel to eastern canada– the mining frontier in bc led to the creation of many mines and smelters mostly through american investment one of the worlds largest smelters still exists today in trail the capital and work to be found in bc during the turn of the th century to the th century led to the creation of several new towns in bc such as nelson nakusp slocan kimberley castlegar rossland and salmo a large coal empire run by robert dunsmuir and his son and later premier james dunsmuir also developed on vancouver island during this era as the economy on the mainland continued to improve as a result of improved transportation and increased settlement other resourcebased economic activity began to flourish throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century fishing forestry and farming including the planting of extensive orchards in the okanagan region became the three fs on which the new province built its economy — a situation that persisted well into the late twentieth century with the booming economy came the expansion of the original fur trading posts into thriving communities such as victoria nanaimo and kamloops it also led to the establishment of new communities such as yale new westminster and — most notably though a latecomer — vancouver the product of the consolidation of the burgeoning mill towns of granville and hastings mill located near the mouth of the fraser on burrard inlet in the later s vancouver was incorporated in  following its selection as the railhead for the canadian pacific railway despite a devastating fire which all but wiped out the city three months later vancouver quickly became the largest city in the province its ports conveying both the resource wealth of the province as well as that transported from the prairie provinces by rail to markets overseas vancouvers status as the principal city in the province has endured augmented by growth in the surrounding municipalities of richmond burnaby surrey delta coquitlam and new westminster today metro vancouver is the third most populous metropolitan area in canada behind toronto and montreal it was also during this period where ethnic diversity began to develop significantly as immigration was not fed entirely by european countries chinese and japanese emigrants made many coastal settlements home beginning in the s and became increasingly more pronounced in the scitation needed th centuryedit truck loaded with logs on temporary logging road bc  since the days of the fur trade british columbias economy has been based on natural resources particularly fishing logging and mining from the canneries to the mills and mines bcs resource sector was increasingly the domain of large commercial interests with industrialization and economic growth workers arrived to join in the seemingly boundless prosperity increasingly these workers came from asia as well as europe the mix of cultures and diversity was a source of strength but also often of conflict the early part of the th century was a time of great change and talk between immigrants and the first nations all of whom found their lives changing rapidly rise of the labour movementedit the dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant labour movement the first major sympathy strike was in  when railway employees struck against the cpr for union recognition labour leader frank rogers was killed while picketing at the docks by cpr police during that strike becoming the british columbia movements first martyr canadas first general strike occurred following the death of another labour leader ginger goodwin in  at the cumberland coal mines on vancouver island a lull in industrial tensions through the later s came to an abrupt end with the great depression most of the s strikes were led by communist party organizers that strike wave peaked in  when unemployed men flooded the city to protest conditions in the relief camps run by the military in remote areas throughout the province after two tense months of daily and disruptive protesting the relief camp strikers decided to take their grievances to the federal government and embarked on the ontoottawa trek but their commandeered train was met by a gatling gun at hatzic just east of mission city and the strikers arrested and interned in work camps for the duration of the depression race and ethnic relationsedit the komagata maru and hmcs rainbow at the time that bc was settled the ideology of the british empire and of many of its colonial settlers was based on an assumption of superiority often racial superiority based on the pseudoscience of race racism and a desire to create a white colony were widespread the scientific thinking of charles darwin was used to develop a theory of the races which is today completely discredited  came to be known as social darwinism under the ideology of social darwinism a series of restrictive laws were passed by both federal and provincial levels of government the potlatch ban outlawed first nations cultural and spiritual practices nonwhite people were denied the vote  specifically first nations chinese and japanese people were not eligible to vote during the th century many immigrant groups arrived in british columbia and today vancouver is the second most ethnically diverse city in canada only behind toronto in  a head tax was imposed on the chinese which reached as much as  per person to enter canada by  by  the government passed the chinese immigration act which prohibited all chinese immigration until  sikhs had to face an amended immigration act in  that required sikhs to have  on arrival in canada and immigration would be allowed only if the passenger had arrived by continuous journey from india which was impossible perhaps the most famous incident of antisikh racism in bc was in  when the komagata maru arrived in vancouver harbour with  sikhs aboard of whom only  were allowed entry the komagata maru spent two months in harbour while the khalsa society went through the courts to appeal their case the khalsa society also kept the passengers on the komagata maru alive during those two months when the case was lost hmcs rainbow a royal canadian navy cruiser escorted the komagata maru out to sea while thousands of caucasians cheered from the seawall of stanley park during the second world war security concerns following the bombing of pearl harbor and canadas entry into the war versus japan led to controversial measures the local japanesecanadian population was openly discriminated against being put in internment camps the pacific coast militia rangers were formed in  in order to provide an armed presence on the coast in addition to the prewar fortress garrisons which were expanded after hostilities japanese military attacks against bc amounted to a small number of parachute bombs released from great distance away and by the middle of  the threat of direct attack diminished following defeat at the battle of midway by us forces prohibitionedit alcohol was prohibited in british columbia for about four years from  to  a referendum in  asked bc citizens whether they approved of making alcohol illegal the other question was whether women had the right to vote the contested results rejecting prohibition led to a major political scandal that subsequently saw the referendum being overturned and alcohol prohibited however by  the failures were so apparent—a thriving black market arbitrary often class and racebased enforcement and punishment rampant corruption—that alcohol was established as a commodity subject to government regulation and taxation as it is today us prohibition in the s and early s led to a thriving business of producing and smuggling alcohol to quench the thirst of bcs southern neighbors many of vancouvers richest families built or consolidated

large areas within british columbia but would prove to be a very stable and renewable source of power for the province st centuryedit if the th century can be said to have been see above one of ethnocultural strife the st thus far can be said to be one of relative harmony one of the first pronouncements of stephen harper upon his victory in the th general election to the parliament in ottawa was that proper redress would be afforded the payers of the chinese head tax  on  june  he offered an apology and  compensation for the head tax once paid by chinese immigrants asian people at  of the

that neither conquest nor treaties were undertaken as settlement occurred under the doctrine of terra nullius with few exceptions the douglas treaties of fort rupert and southern vancouver island no treaties were signed some early settlers assumed based on the catastrophic population crash of first nations peoples linked to smallpox and racist ideas that indians were a dying race led to a lack of action to deal with what was then termed the indian land question upon confederation the federal government assumed responsibility for indians and lands reserved for indians while the province had responsibility for nonaboriginal civil matters and resources the  mckennamcbride royal commission made some amendments to lands but failed to deal with issues pertaining to title and first nations rights several delegations to ottawa and london were sent by first nations seeking redress for grievances to little avail instead the indian act federal legislation governing first nations was amended to make it a crime to organize or engage legal council other oppressive measure also accompanied the amendment including the potlatch ban and the increasingly applied indian residential school system designed to assimilate first nations the status of the first nations aboriginal people of british columbia is a longstanding problem that has become a major issue in recent years first nations were confined to tiny reserves that no longer provide an economic base they were provided with inadequate education and discriminated against in numerous ways in many areas they were excluded from restaurants and other establishments status indians gained the right to vote in  they were prohibited from possessing alcohol which rather than preventing problems with this drug exacerbated them by fostering unhealthy patterns of consumption such as binge drinkingcitation needed certain privileges of status indians are governed by the indian act with the exception of what are known as the douglas treaties negotiated by sir james douglas with the native people of the victoria area no treaties were signed in british columbia until  many native people wished to negotiate treaties but the province refused until  another major development was the  decision of the supreme court of canada in the delgamuukw v british columbia case that aboriginal title still exists in british columbia  of first nations in british columbia are aligned with the first nations summit this brings a total of  first nations but only  are said to be in active negotiations three final agreements have been settled with one being rejected by lheidli tenneh in  the other two the maanulth treaty group a  nuuchahnulth member group and the tsawwassen first nation although these treaties have yet to be ratified by parliament in ottawa and legislature in victoria neighbouring first nations are seeking to block these treaties in the courts a group of vancouver island and some mainland first nations the wsanec lekwungen and semiahmoo are seeking to block to tsawwassen first nation treaty claiming infringement on their rights and land titles on the west coast of vancouver island the ditidaht first nation is doing the same against the maanulth treaty group the only treaty signed in recent years the nisgaa treaty  was negotiated outside of the current treaty process there is considerable disagreement about treaty negotiations among indigenous people there is mounting criticism of extinguishment of aboriginal title and continued assimilation strategies by attempting to change the indigenous peoples from nations to municipal style government therefore a substantial number of first nations governments consider the current treaty process inadequate and have refused to participatecitation needed a november  court ruling for the xeni gwetin first nation called future participation in the process into question the judge ruled that the xeni gwetin could demonstrate aboriginal title to half of the nemaia valley and that the province had no power over these lands under the bc treaty process negotiating nations have received as little as  of their claimed land

british columbia is the westernmost province of canada originally politically constituted as a pair of british colonies british columbia joined the canadian confederation on july   perhaps the most influential historian of british columbia has been margaret ormsby in british columbia a history  she presented a structural model that has been adopted by numerous historians and teachers chad reimer says in many aspects it still has not been surpassed ormsby posited a series of propositions that provided the dynamic to the history the ongoing pull between maritime and continental forces the opposition between a closed hierarchical model of society represented by the hudsons bay company and colonial officials and the open egalitarian vision of english and canadian settlers and regional

back thousands of years archaeology has identified dates in british columbia as early as  years ago with some exciting potential for underwater sites beginning to be detected the geography of the land influenced cultural development of the peoples  and in places allowed for cultural development of permanent villages complex social institutions and a huge range of languages bc is divided by anthropological theory into three cultural areas  the northwest coast the plateau and the north first nations in each area developed customs and approaches to living that fit the resources in the region through much of british columbia salmon are available and formed a substantial part of the diet where available the term precontact is used to describe the time period prior to contact between first nations and european explorers the precise time of contact varied according to circumstance but took place on the coast between the s and  in places in the interior it occurred later british columbia before the arrival of the europeans was home to many indigenous peoples speaking more than  different languages including babinewitsuwiten danezaa beaver carrier chilcotin gitxsan haida halkomelem kaska kutenai lillooet nisgaa nuuchahnulth nuxalk sekani shuswap sinixt squamish tagish tahltan thompson tlingit tsetsaut and tsimshian there was frequent contact between bands and voyages across the strait of georgia and the strait of juan de fuca were common the abundance of natural resources such as salmon and cedar enabled the development of a complex hierarchical society within coastal communities with so much food being available the peoples of the coastal regions could focus their time on other pursuits such as art politics and warfare early spanish explorersedit the first visitors to presentday british columbia were spanish sailors and other european sailors who sailed for the spanish crown there is some evidence that the greekborn juan de fuca who sailed for spain and explored the west coast of north america in the s might have reached the passageway between washington state and vancouver island—today known as the strait of juan de fuca a later british explorer named charles william barkley named the passage after juan de fucas reputed visit there is not much evidence to suggest that european traders and explorers regularly came to presentday british columbia in the th century the arrival of europeans began to intensify in the midth century as fur traders entered the area to harvest sea otters while there is a theory and some evidence that sir francis drake may have explored the british columbia coast in  it is conventionally claimed that it was juan francisco de la bodega y quadra who completed the first documented voyage which took place in  in doing so quadra reasserted the spanish claim for the whole of the pacific coast first made by vasco núñez de balboa in  who declared the whole of the pacific and its shores as part of the spanish empire in  the spanish navigator juan josé pérez hernández a native of mexico sailed from san blas nueva galicia modernday nayarit with instructions to reach ° north latitude to discover possible russian settlements and take possession of the lands for the spanish crown hernández reached ° north latitude becoming the first european to sight the queen charlotte islands and vancouver island he traded with the natives near estevan point although apparently without landing the expedition was forced to return to nueva galicia due to the lack of provisions since pérez hernándezs first expedition failed to achieve its objective the spanish organized a second expedition in  with the same goal this expedition was commanded by bruno de heceta on board the santiago piloted by pérez hernández and accompanied by juan francisco de la bodega y quadra in la sonora after illnesses storms and other troubles had affected the expedition de heceta returned to nueva galicia while quadra kept on a northward course ultimately reaching ° north in what today is sitka alaska during this expedition the spanish made sure to land several times and formally claim the lands for the spanish crown while verifying the absence of russian settlements along the coast in the following years several other spanish expeditions would set sail from nueva galicia bound for the pacific northwest three years later in  the british royal navy captain james cook arrived in the region searching for the northwest passage and successfully landed at nootka sound on vancouver island where he and his crew traded with the nuuchahnulth first nation upon trading his goods for sea otter pelts his crew in turn traded them for an enormous profit in macau on their way back to britain this led to an influx of traders to the british columbian coast and ongoing economic contact with the aboriginal peoples there early european villages –sedit nootka sound marked in vancouver island reconstruction of fort san miguel friendly cove nootka sound volume i plate vii from a voyage of discovery to the north pacific ocean and round the world by george vancouver in  john meares an english navigator and explorer sailed from china and explored nootka sound and the neighbouring coasts he bought some land from a local chief named maquinna and built a trading post there two years later in  the spanish commander esteban josé martínez a native of seville established a settlement and started building a fort in friendly cove nootka sound which was named fort san miguel this territory was already considered as part of new spain by the spanish due to the previous explorations of the region upon martinezs arrival a number of british ships were seized including those of captain meares this originated the nootka crisis which almost led to a war between britain and spain the controversy resulted in the abandonment of the nootka sound settlement by the spanish some months later manuel antonio flores viceroy of new spain ordered a francisco de eliza to rebuild the fort the expedition composed of three ships the concepción under the command of de eliza the san carlos under the command of salvador fidalgo and the princesa real under the command of manuel quimper sailed in early  from san blas in nueva galicia and arrived at nootka sound in april of that year the expedition had many catalan volunteers from the first free company of volunteers of catalonia commanded by pere dalberní a native of tortosa the expedition rebuilt the fort which had been dismantled after martínez abandoned it the rebuilt fort included several defensive constructions as well as a vegetable garden to ensure the settlement had food supplies the catalan volunteers left the fort in  and spanish influence in the region ended in  after the nootka convention came into force late british expeditions s–edit subsequently european explorermerchants from the east started to discover british columbia three figures dominate in the early history of mainland british columbia sir alexander mackenzie simon fraser and david thompson as employees of the north west company the three were primarily concerned with discovering a practicable river route to the pacific specifically via the columbia river for the extension of the fur trade in  mackenzie became the first european to reach the pacific overland north of the rio grande he and his crew entered the region through the rocky mountains via the peace river reaching the ocean at north bentinck arm near presentday bella coola shortly thereafter mackenzies companion john finlay founded the first permanent european settlement in british columbia fort st john located at the junction of the beatton and peace rivers simon fraser was the next to try to find the course of the columbia during his expedition of  fraser and his crew including john stuart explored much of the british columbia interior establishing several forts hudsons hope trout lake fort fort george fort fraser and fort st james frasers expedition took him down the river that now bears his name to the site of presentday vancouver although both mackenzie and fraser reached the pacific they found the routes they took impassable for trade it was david thompson who found the columbia river and followed it down to its mouth in  he was unable to establish a claim however for the american explorers lewis and clark had already claimed the territory for the united states of america six years earlier the american fur company of john jacob astor had founded fort astoria just months before thompson arrived though within a year the local staff at astoria sold the fort and others in the region to the north west company which renamed it fort george though returned to us hands as a result of treaty complications at the end of the war of  this meant only there was a parallel us fort adjacent to the nwc one which was the more prosperous of the two following the forced merger of the north west company and hudsons bay company in  fort vancouver was established as the new regional headquarters from fur trade districts to colonies –edit although technically a part of british north america british columbia was largely run by the hudsons bay company after its merger with the north west company in  the central interior of the region was organized into the new caledonia district a name that came to be generally attributed to the mainland as a whole it was administered from fort st james about  km northwest of presentday prince george the interior south of the thompson river and north of california was named by the company the columbia district and was administered first from fort vancouver present day vancouver washington throughout the s and s the hbc controlled nearly all trading operations in the pacific northwest based out of the company headquarters at fort vancouver on the columbia river although authority over the region was nominally shared by the united states and britain through the angloamerican convention of  company policy enforced via chief factor john mcloughlin of the companys columbia district was to discourage any settlement including us settlement of the territory the companys effective monopoly on trade virtually forbade any settlement in the region it established fort boise in  in presentday southwestern idaho to compete with the american fort hall  km  mi to the east in  it purchased fort hall also along the route of the oregon trail where the outpost director displayed the abandoned wagons of discouraged settlers to those seeking to move west along the trail fort vancouver was the nexus for the fur trade on the pacific coast its influence reached from the rocky mountains to the hawaiian islands and from alaska into mexicancontrolled california at its pinnacle fort vancouver watched over  outposts  ports six ships and  employees also for many primarily american settlers the fort became the last stop on the oregon trail as they could get supplies before starting their homestead by  the hudsons bay company operated numerous posts in the columbia department including fort vancouver fort george astoria fort nisqually fort umpqua fort langley fort colville fort okanogan fort kamloops fort alexandria flathead post kootanae house fort boise fort hall fort simpson fort taku fort mcloughlin in milbanke sound fort stikine as well as a number of others a very high degree of linguistic variation occurs in bc  a response to this was the development of a trade jargon  chinook jargon not a complete language it was used in trade governance and some early writings for example hymns by  john jacob astor had founded astoria and ten years later the hudsons bay company had established itself on the columbia in the meantime the explorers and traders had been coming by land somewhere and sometime during this period the existence of the chinook jargon became known all the indians talked it to each other and resorted to it in their conversations with the whites knowledge of this trade language became a necessary part of the traders equipment fort victoria was established as a trading post in  both as a means to protect hbc interests as well as to assert british claims to vancouver island and the adjacent gulf islands the gulf islands and strait of juan de fuca are the access point to puget sound as well as a fall back position in preparation for the worst case scenario settlement of the dispute in the face of manifest destiny increasing numbers of american settlers arriving on the oregon trail gave rise to the oregon boundary dispute the hudsons bay company dominated and controlled all territory north of the columbia river the british position was that a fair division of the columbia district was a boundary at the columbia river in  the united states democratic party asserted that the us had a legitimate claim to the entire columbia district or oregon country but president james polk was prepared to draw the border along the th parallel the longstanding us proposal when the british rejected this offer polk broke off negotiations and american expansionists reasserted the claim coining slogans most famously fiftyfour forty or fight with the outbreak of the mexicanamerican war diverting attention and resources polk was again prepared to compromise the oregon boundary dispute was settled in the  treaty of washington the terms of the agreement established the border between british north america and the united states at the th parallel from the rocky mountains to the sea the original american proposal with all of vancouver island retained as british territory this effectively destroyed the geographical logic of the hbcs columbia department since the lower columbia river was the core and lifeline of the system the us soon organized its portion as the oregon territory the administrative headquarters of fur operations and of the columbia department then shifted north to fort victoria which had been founded by james douglas in  the crown colony of vancouver island was created and in  james douglas was appointed governor douglas known as the father of british columbia established colonial institutions in victoria he started the process of expanding the economic base of the new colony by signing  treaties between  to purchase land for settlement and industrial development coal deposits were known by the hwbc in the vicinities of nanaimo and fort rupert subsequent native population crashes later in the th century along with economic upheaval and native wars allowed his political successors to be much less consistent with british principles treaties and laws meanwhile on the mainland new caledonia continued to focus on the fur trade with few nonnative inhabitants mostly hbc employees and their familiescitation needed under the administrative oversight of douglas who was also the hbcs regional chief executive the hudsons bay company like the previous french colony and north west company of montreal still officially discouraged settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade the fur trade was a mutually beneficial relationship between the local hbc trading fort and adjacent native tribes american expansion and control of territory was predicated primarily by settlement of the land not commercial relationships with the existing local population the british made virtually no effort to assert sovereignty over the aboriginal peoples of the area in accordance with the royal proclamation of  largescale settlement by nonaboriginal people was prohibited until the lands were surrendered by treaty colonial british columbia –edit in  gold was found along the banks of the thompson river just east of what is now lytton british columbia triggering the fraser canyon gold rush when word got out to san francisco about gold in british territory victoria was transformed overnight into a tent city as prospectors speculators land agents and outfitters flooded in from around the world mostly via san francisco the hudsons bay companys fort langley burgeoned economically as the staging point for many of the prospectors heading by boat to the canyon a wide range of linguistic diversity among first nations and explorerstraders made communication difficult trade jargon initially used by first nations expanded and changed to include words from english and french to become the chinook jargon not a complete language the jargon became widespread among first nations and early europeans to enable communication and trade though little used today a significant number of place names in british columbia deprive from chinook and early anthropologists sometimes recorded stories using the jargon at the time the region was still not under formal colonial authority douglas fearing challenges to the claim of british sovereignty in the region in the face of an influx of some  americans stationed a gunboat at the mouth of the fraser in order to obtain license fees from those seeking to head upstream the resolution of the oregon boundary dispute whereby british interests primarily the hbc lost governance of all territory between the th parallel and the columbia river due to a sudden influx of american settlers  years previous richard clement moody and the royal engineersedit when news of the fraser canyon gold rush reached london the colonial office established the mainland as a crown colony on august   naming it the colony of british columbia richard clement moody was handpicked by the colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia – into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and “found a second england on the shores of the pacific” lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force’ he sought men who possessed ‘courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world’ and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the archetypal english gentleman and british officer’ at the head of the columbia detachment which was created by an act of the british parliament on  august  the engineers were believed to exemplify the qualities sought by the government col richard moody commander of the columbia detachment moody arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary and the two became close friends ned mcgowans waredit moody had hoped to begin immediately the foundation of a capital city but upon his arrival at fort langley he learned of an outbreak of violence at the settlement of hills bar this led to an incident popularly known as ned mcgowans war where moody led  engineers and judge matthew baillie begbie to yale to face down a group of rebellious american miners order was restored without further strict pain  the foundation of new westminsteredit in british columbia moody ‘wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness’ and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance ‘styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe’ subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending miles to the right  left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities  yet fr the background of superb mountains swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody likened his vision of the nascent colony of british columbia to the pastoral scenes painted by aelbert cuyp moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town’ and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuous hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled’ the feud between moody and governor james douglasedit throughout his tenure in british columbia richard clement moody was engaged in a bitter feud with sir james douglas governor of vancouver island whose jurisdiction overlapped with his own moody’s position as chief commissioner and lieutenantgovernor was one of ‘higher prestige and lesser authority than that of douglas despite moodys vastly superior social position in the eyes of the engineers and the british government moody had been selected by lord lytton due to his possession of the quality of the archetypal english gentleman and british officer his family was eminently respectable he was the son of colonel thomas moody  one of the wealthiest mercantilists in the west indies who owned much of the land in the islands where douglass father owned a small amount of land and from which douglass mother a halfbreed originated governor douglass ethnicity and made him ‘an affront to victorian society’ mary moody the descendant of the hawks industrial dynasty and the boyd merchant banking family wrote on  august  it is not pleasant to serve under a hudsons bay factor and that the governor and richard can never get on in letter to the colonial office of  december  richard clement moody boasts that he has ‘entirely disarmed douglas of all jealously douglas repeatedly insulted the engineers by attempting to assume their command and refusing to acknowledge their value in the nascent colony margaret a ormsby author of the dictionary of canadian biography entry for moody  condemns moody for a contribution to the abortive development of the city however most other historians have exonerated moody for the abortive development of the city and consider his achievement to be impressive especially with regard to the perpetual insufficiency of funds and the personally motivated opposition of douglas whose opposition to the project continually retarded its development robert edgar cail don w thomson ishiguro and scott have praised moody for his contribution the latter accusing ormsby of being ‘adamant in her dislike of colonel moody’ despite the evidence and almost all biographies of moody including those of the institute of civil engineers the royal engineers and the british columbia historical association are flattering other developmentsedit moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbing port moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor frederick seymour second governor of the colony of british columbia and his cat royal engineers columbia detachment was disbanded in july  the moody family only  men and  wives returned to england while the rest  sappers elected to remain in bc scott contends that the departure of the engineers doomed the development of the settlement and the fruition of lord lyttons dream chartres brew replaced moody as land commissioner the second gold rushedit a second major gold rush in the cariboo region of the colony occurred in  in the midst of smaller ones notably in the omenica big bend and on the stikine the influx of gold miners into bcs economy led to the creation of basic infrastructure in bc most notably the creation of the cariboo wagon road which linked the lower mainland to the rich gold fields of barkerville however the enormous costs of the road and its predecessor the douglas road and services such as the gold escort left bc in debt by the mids in  because of the massive debt leftover from the gold rush the mainland and vancouver island became one colony named british columbia with its capital in victoria on vancouver island settlement and industrial development took place along the shorelines for example see the th century settlement in comox or colony of vancouver island annexation debateedit in  there were three options open to continue as a british colony to be annexed by the united states or to confederate with the newly formed dominion of canada in britain many little englanders expected or even hoped that its north american colonies would depart from the british empire admiral joseph denman told the admiralty that british columbia did not deserve royal navy protection and advised the british government to divest herself of these possessions by any means consistent with honour secretary of state for the colonies lord granville stated his wish that british north america would propose to be independent and annex themselves the times view was the british consensus british columbia is a long way off  with the exception of a limited official class it receives few immigrants from england and a large proportion of its inhabitants consists of citizens of the united states who have entered it from the south suppose that the colonists met together and came to the conclusion that every natural motive of contiguity similarity of interests and facility of administration induced them to think it more convenient to slip into the union than into the dominion  we all know that we should not attempt to withstand them financially becoming officially part of the united states made sense since british columbia was economically essentially a satellite of san francisco—the most important city of the entire american west and north americas pacific coast—washington and oregon which provided all of the colonys supplies despite a substantial american tariff american currency circulated widely in the colony whose nearest british neighbors were red river  miles to the east and hong kong to the west san franciscos population in the s exceeded  while victorias never rose above  all mail from british columbia went through san francisco forcing the colonys post office to keep large amounts of american postage stamps– the opening of the american transcontinental railroad in  made it possible to travel by ship from victoria to san francisco then by train to ottawa or washington in just  days with the gold now gone most of the american miners had left and the economic future did not look promising unless bc could join the very rapidly growing rich economies of the pacific states while american residents of british columbia celebrated the united states purchase of alaska in  having american territory to their north and south caused british residents fears for the future of their colony to grow alaska was part of american secretary of state william h sewards plan to incorporate the entire northwest pacific coast chiefly for the longterm commercial advantages to the united states in terms of pacific trade seward believed that the people in british columbia wanted annexation and that britain would accept this in exchange for the alabama claims in the event seward dropped the idea of an exchange and accepted an arbitration plan that settled the alabama claims for cash when a false report circulated in april soon after the alaska news that the british government was considering settling the claims by ceding the colony a substantial annexation movement appeared supported by many residents and three of the colonys six newspapers anticonfederationists who were not necessarily annexationists were the majority on vancouver island that said annexationists argued that the colony would never be able to negotiate with the united states a free trade agreement similar to the reciprocity treaty of  and that annexation would end the disadvantage of the american tariff most canadianborn residents supported confederation with their land of origin but were not very popular as many in the colony believed that they sent their money home instead of spending it in british columbia as the americanborn colonists did residents of the mainland almost unanimously supported confederation with the rest of british north america they argued that this would benefit the colony as canada would soon negotiate another reciprocity treaty many britishborn colonists were on both sides–– representative nathaniel p banks of massachusetts annexation bill of  offered voluntary annexation to british north america including territorial status for vancouver island and british columbia together as the territory of columbia the bill was unsuccessful as was senator alexander ramsey of minnesotas  proposal that the united states as part of another reciprocity treaty with canada offer  million to the hudsons bay company for the territory west of the th longitude the us would assume british columbias  million debt and subsidize the northern pacific railway to build a road to puget sound– two american military officers who travelled throughout british columbia for two months while arranging for supply of occupation troops in alaska wrote a detailed report to washington in november  of their belief that a majority of residents supported annexation they claimed that it did not become necessary in a single instance to broach the subject of the cession of that territory to the united states for it was the constant theme of conversation employees of the hudsons bay company were said to be especially supportive although they and many others could not make their opinion public because of fears of being denounced as disloyal a majority of british columbians never publicly supported american annexation however and support for joining canada grew over time in particular annexationists failed to persuade the anticonfederation hudsons bay company officials and their friends that dominated vancouver island politics accusations that american gold and american greenbacks funded renegade englishmen likely hurt annexation support whether the us officers belief of the existence of widespread covert support was correct by october  annexation no longer appeared as a topic in british columbia newspapers or documents until the alaska purchase and the new dominion status which were almost simultaneous the british had been indifferent to the fate of british columbia london now paid attention and realized the value of bc as a base for its imperial trade opportunities in the pacific and the need of the royal navy for a station in the region by  public opinion was likely on the confederation side annexationists or at least anticonfederationists were in control of the legislative council of british columbia however and in february  passed a resolution opposing confederation until his death the colonial governor frederick seymour also opposed confederation successor anthony musgrave supported confederation after being unsuccessful in bringing newfoundland into canada but due to an accident was delayed in his duties meanwhile annexation support revived during the winter of  one hundred four individuals about one percent of the white population of the colony signed an  petition to president ulysses s grant asking for annexation while there is no reason to believe that they accurately represented the majority opinion it is true that many colonists viewed washington and london as equal competitors for british columbias loyalty depending on who offered more incentives while ottawa was more foreign and less familiar– in august  lord granville communicated londons new view of british columbia when he wrote to musgrave i have no hesitation in stating that support of confederation is also the opinion of her majestys government in february  musgrave successfully persuaded the legislative council to pass a resolution supporting confederation with canada many britishborn colonists now supported confederation as the best way to maintain a connection with britain by april the victoria colonist reported that a mass meeting in victoria supported confederation while the most vague hint in the direction of annexation was met with a howl of execration musgrave proposed an attractive plan for joining canada with the dominion assuming the colonys debt and building a new canadian transcontinental railway that would eliminate the reliance on the american railroad meanwhile the united states was so focused on issues of reconstruction that few americans picked up on sewards grand dream to expand manifest destiny to the pacific entry into canada –edit see also british columbia § rapid growth and development  map of british columbia showing federal electoral districts a map produced in london in  to facilitate emigration to british columbia showing the natural resources of the new province both the depressed economic situation arising from the collapse of the gold rushes as well as a desire for the establishment of truly responsible and representative government led to enormous domestic pressure for british columbia to join the canadian confederation which had been proclaimed in  the confederation league spearheaded by three future premiers of the province — amor de cosmos robert beaven and john robson — took a leading role in pushing the colony towards this goal and so it was on july   that british columbia became the sixth province to join canada in return for entering confederation canada absorbed bcs massive debt and promised to build a railway from montreal to the pacific coast within  years contrary to popular belief british columbia did not demand a transcontinental railroad as a condition of confederation its delegates expected a wagon road but john a macdonalds national government proposed the railroad as a substitute with ottawa and london viewing it as a way of connecting not just british columbia but the prairies with the rest of the british empire– the promise of a railroad became however the most important reason for british columbia to stay within canada the provincial legislature threatened to secede in  because macdonalds successor alexander mackenzie whose liberal party had opposed the railroad attempted to modify the promise macdonalds return to power that year likely kept british columbia from departing canada– in fulfillment of the promise the last spike of the canadian pacific railway was driven in craigellachie on  november  no good road yet existed between british columbia and other provinces until the completion of the transcanada highway automobiles had to enter the united states to travel to eastern canada– the mining frontier in bc led to the creation of many mines and smelters mostly through american investment one of the worlds largest smelters still exists today in trail the capital and work to be found in bc during the turn of the th century to the th century led to the creation of several new towns in bc such as nelson nakusp slocan kimberley castlegar rossland and salmo a large coal empire run by robert dunsmuir and his son and later premier james dunsmuir also developed on vancouver island during this era as the economy on the mainland continued to improve as a result of improved transportation and increased settlement other resourcebased economic activity began to flourish throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century fishing forestry and farming including the planting of extensive orchards in the okanagan region became the three fs on which the new province built its economy — a situation that persisted well into the late twentieth century with the booming economy came the expansion of the original fur trading posts into thriving communities such as victoria nanaimo and kamloops it also led to the establishment of new communities such as yale new westminster and — most notably though a latecomer — vancouver the product of the consolidation of the burgeoning mill towns of granville and hastings mill located near the mouth of the fraser on burrard inlet in the later s vancouver was incorporated in  following its selection as the railhead for the canadian pacific railway despite a devastating fire which all but wiped out the city three months later vancouver quickly became the largest city in the province its ports conveying both the resource wealth of the province as well as that transported from the prairie provinces by rail to markets overseas vancouvers status as the principal city in the province has endured augmented by growth in the surrounding municipalities of richmond burnaby surrey delta coquitlam and new westminster today metro vancouver is the third most populous metropolitan area in canada behind toronto and montreal it was also during this period where ethnic diversity began to develop significantly as immigration was not fed entirely by european countries chinese and japanese emigrants made many coastal settlements home beginning in the s and became increasingly more pronounced in the scitation needed th centuryedit truck loaded with logs on temporary logging road bc  since the days of the fur trade british columbias economy has been based on natural resources particularly fishing logging and mining from the canneries to the mills and mines bcs resource sector was increasingly the domain of large commercial interests with industrialization and economic growth workers arrived to join in the seemingly boundless prosperity increasingly these workers came from asia as well as europe the mix of cultures and diversity was a source of strength but also often of conflict the early part of the th century was a time of great change and talk between immigrants and the first nations all of whom found their lives changing rapidly rise of the labour movementedit the dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant labour movement the first major sympathy strike was in  when railway employees struck against the cpr for union recognition labour leader frank rogers was killed while picketing at the docks by cpr police during that strike becoming the british columbia movements first martyr canadas first general strike occurred following the death of another labour leader ginger goodwin in  at the cumberland coal mines on vancouver island a lull in industrial tensions through the later s came to an abrupt end with the great depression most of the s strikes were led by communist party organizers that strike wave peaked in  when unemployed men flooded the city to protest conditions in the relief camps run by the military in remote areas throughout the province after two tense months of daily and disruptive protesting the relief camp strikers decided to take their grievances to the federal government and embarked on the ontoottawa trek but their commandeered train was met by a gatling gun at hatzic just east of mission city and the strikers arrested and interned in work camps for the duration of the depression race and ethnic relationsedit the komagata maru and hmcs rainbow at the time that bc was settled the ideology of the british empire and of many of its colonial settlers was based on an assumption of superiority often racial superiority based on the pseudoscience of race racism and a desire to create a white colony were widespread the scientific thinking of charles darwin was used to develop a theory of the races which is today completely discredited  came to be known as social darwinism under the ideology of social darwinism a series of restrictive laws were passed by both federal and provincial levels of government the potlatch ban outlawed first nations cultural and spiritual practices nonwhite people were denied the vote  specifically first nations chinese and japanese people were not eligible to vote during the th century many immigrant groups arrived in british columbia and today vancouver is the second most ethnically diverse city in canada only behind toronto in  a head tax was imposed on the chinese which reached as much as  per person to enter canada by  by  the government passed the chinese immigration act which prohibited all chinese immigration until  sikhs had to face an amended immigration act in  that required sikhs to have  on arrival in canada and immigration would be allowed only if the passenger had arrived by continuous journey from india which was impossible perhaps the most famous incident of antisikh racism in bc was in  when the komagata maru arrived in vancouver harbour with  sikhs aboard of whom only  were allowed entry the komagata maru spent two months in harbour while the khalsa society went through the courts to appeal their case the khalsa society also kept the passengers on the komagata maru alive during those two months when the case was lost hmcs rainbow a royal canadian navy cruiser escorted the komagata maru out to sea while thousands of caucasians cheered from the seawall of stanley park during the second world war security concerns following the bombing of pearl harbor and canadas entry into the war versus japan led to controversial measures the local japanesecanadian population was openly discriminated against being put in internment camps the pacific coast militia rangers were formed in  in order to provide an armed presence on the coast in addition to the prewar fortress garrisons which were expanded after hostilities japanese military attacks against bc amounted to a small number of parachute bombs released from great distance away and by the middle of  the threat of direct attack diminished following defeat at the battle of midway by us forces prohibitionedit alcohol was prohibited in british columbia for about four years from  to  a referendum in  asked bc citizens whether they approved of making alcohol illegal the other question was whether women had the right to vote the contested results rejecting prohibition led to a major political scandal that subsequently saw the referendum being overturned and alcohol prohibited however by  the failures were so apparent—a thriving black market arbitrary often class and racebased enforcement and punishment rampant corruption—that alcohol was established as a commodity subject to government regulation and taxation as it is today us prohibition in the s and early s led to a thriving business of producing and smuggling alcohol to quench the thirst of bcs southern neighbors many of vancouvers richest families built or consolidated their fortunes in the rumrunning business some compare todays robust cannabisgrowing industry in bc the numberone cash crop to this earlier era world war ii contributionsedit a pacific command was created in  also and was disbanded in  during the war a range of coastal defences were constructed including harbour defences for vancouver todays museum of anthropology at ubc sits atop the foundation for gun batteries that were used to command vancouver harbour approaches militia units from southern bc provided cadres for many regiments that eventually fought in europe the rocky mountain rangers sent a battalion to fight the japanese in the battle of the aleutian islands in  thousands more british columbians volunteered for the royal canadian navy and royal canadian air force two soldiers ernest alvia smith and john keefer mahony were awarded the victoria cross for actions with bcbased regiments in italy columbia river treatyedit in  british columbia ratified the columbia river treaty which required the building of three large dams in british columbia in return for financial compensation related to us hydroelectric power production enabled by the dams the dams flooded large areas within british columbia but would prove to be a very stable and renewable source of power for the province st centuryedit if the th century can be said to have been see above one of ethnocultural strife the st thus far can be said to be one of relative harmony one of the first pronouncements of stephen harper upon his victory in the th general election to the parliament in ottawa was that proper redress would be afforded the payers of the chinese head tax  on  june  he offered an apology and  compensation for the head tax once paid by chinese immigrants asian people at  of the total population were in the  census by far the largest visible minority demographic with many of the lower mainlands large cities having sizable chinese south asian japanese filipino and korean communities the chinese appeasement policies continue to bear fruit whereas prior to  the federal government was illdisposed toward the chinese by spring of that year the china investment corporation was able to purchase of a  share fraction of the vancouver miner teck resources the transition of views on the chinese government has been unprecedented from one of fear to one of official cooperation in the space of five years and in the face of popular trepidation in november  british columbia finance minister mike de jong reported a successful placement of chinese rmbbn in dim sum bonds the province hosted the  winter olympics in vancouver and whistler crimesedit the scandal of the december  bc legislature raids which led to the october  conviction of dave basi and bob virk ministerial aides to gary collins and janet reid respectively involved bribes  cash meals and nfl tickets  in exchange for leaking confidential information about the sale of bc rail the case set precedent in r v basi according to which defendants counsel may participate at pretrial hearings involving a police informant although robert pickton had apparently claimed responsibility for  murders at or near his pig farm in port coquitlam at trial by jury in  he was only convicted of six on  october  robert dziekański was tasered by a royal canadian mounted police officer the incident might have been unreported but for the cellphone video taken by eyewitness paul pritchard it took six years for the provincial coroner to determine that death of dziekanski was a homicide a drug dealer who failed to pay  to the red scorpion gang for trafficking on the its turf was the catalyst for the execution of six people in a surrey high rise in  civil amercementedit after a scandalfilled second term for the bc ndp government the bc liberals won the  election with the biggest landslide in bc history  of  seats gordon campbell became the seventh premier in ten years and the first liberal premier in almost  years on  november  the civil forfeiture act cfa was passed by campbells second government with a  majority this act followed ontarios civil remedies act which had passed in november  this act makes it possible for the government to amerce or to seize property without due process and the civil forfeiture office cfo has been eager to use this power in order to fill the coffers of government the office does not need criminal charges or convictions to amerce a property bill  was introduced by solicitorgeneral rich coleman who made liberal use of the organised crime fear uncertainty and doubt tactic he also mentioned that ontario manitoba and alberta had also recently introduced similar legislation the act which was brought in with organised crime as the target since at least  has been expanded to target ordinary citizens in latterday practice amercements may include partial jang or full seizure lloydsmith rai of a house on  may  solicitorgeneral shirley bond of christy clarks first government introduced the concept of administrative forfeiture under which a civil court is no longer required to judge amercements of property worth less than  the cfo moved in summer  to seize the guide certificate of robert milligan a certain way to destroy his livelihood the cfo has a budgetary target offences under the motor vehicle act wildlife act and employment standards act are now pursued by the cfo the public is now bribed with the proceeds for example violenceprevention projects at six schools an antigang campaign women and family violence programs and a workshop on sexual exploitation awareness justice minister suzanne anton expressed unreserved support for the cfo and cfa in a january  interview first nationsedit the legacy of british imperialism in bc is unusual in that neither conquest nor treaties were undertaken as settlement occurred under the doctrine of terra nullius with few exceptions the douglas treaties of fort rupert and southern vancouver island no treaties were signed some early settlers assumed based on the catastrophic population crash of first nations peoples linked to smallpox and racist ideas that indians were a dying race led to a lack of action to deal with what was then termed the indian land question upon confederation the federal government assumed responsibility for indians and lands reserved for indians while the province had responsibility for nonaboriginal civil matters and resources the  mckennamcbride royal commission made some amendments to lands but failed to deal with issues pertaining to title and first nations rights several delegations to ottawa and london were sent by first nations seeking redress for grievances to little avail instead the indian act federal legislation governing first nations was amended to make it a crime to organize or engage legal council other oppressive measure also accompanied the amendment including the potlatch ban and the increasingly applied indian residential school system designed to assimilate first nations the status of the first nations aboriginal people of british columbia is a longstanding problem that has become a major issue in recent years first nations were confined to tiny reserves that no longer provide an economic base they were provided with inadequate education and discriminated against in numerous ways in many areas they were excluded from restaurants and other establishments status indians gained the right to vote in  they were prohibited from possessing alcohol which rather than preventing problems with this drug exacerbated them by fostering unhealthy patterns of consumption such as binge drinkingcitation needed certain privileges of status indians are governed by the indian act with the exception of what are known as the douglas treaties negotiated by sir james douglas with the native people of the victoria area no treaties were signed in british columbia until  many native people wished to negotiate treaties but the province refused until  another major development was the  decision of the supreme court of canada in the delgamuukw v british columbia case that aboriginal title still exists in british columbia  of first nations in british columbia are aligned with the first nations summit this brings a total of  first nations but only  are said to be in active negotiations three final agreements have been settled with one being rejected by lheidli tenneh in  the other two the maanulth treaty group a  nuuchahnulth member group and the tsawwassen first nation although these treaties have yet to be ratified by parliament in ottawa and legislature in victoria neighbouring first nations are seeking to block these treaties in the courts a group of vancouver island and some mainland first nations the wsanec lekwungen and semiahmoo are seeking to block to tsawwassen first nation treaty claiming infringement on their rights and land titles on the west coast of vancouver island the ditidaht first nation is doing the same against the maanulth treaty group the only treaty signed in recent years the nisgaa treaty  was negotiated outside of the current treaty process there is considerable disagreement about treaty negotiations among indigenous people there is mounting criticism of extinguishment of aboriginal title and continued assimilation strategies by attempting to change the indigenous peoples from nations to municipal style government therefore a substantial number of first nations governments consider the current treaty process inadequate and have refused to participatecitation needed a november  court ruling for the xeni gwetin first nation called future participation in the process into question the judge ruled that the xeni gwetin could demonstrate aboriginal title to half of the nemaia valley and that the province had no power over these lands under the bc treaty process negotiating nations have received as little as  of their claimed land recognized grand chief stewart phillip president of the union of bc indian

the first british settlement in the area was fort victoria established in  which gave rise to the city of victoria at first the capital of the separate colony of vancouver island subsequently on the mainland the colony of british columbia – was founded by richard clement moody and the royal engineers columbia detachment in response to the fraser canyon gold rush moody was chief commissioner of lands and works for the colony and the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia he was handpicked by the colonial office in london to transform british columbia into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west and to found a second england on the shores of the pacific moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of british columbia new westminster established the cariboo

the province is currently governed by the british columbia new democratic party in a minority supported by the british columbia green party led by premier john horgan who became premier as a result of a noconfidence motion on june   british columbia evolved from british possessions that were established in what is now british columbia by  first nations the original inhabitants of the land have a history of at least  years in the area today there are few treaties and the question of aboriginal title long ignored has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions notably the tsilhqotin nation has established aboriginal title to a portion of their territory as a result of the recent supreme court of canada decision william tsilhqotin nation v british columbia bcs economy is diverse with service producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the provinces gdp it is the endpoint of transcontinental railways and the site of major pacific ports that enable international trade though less than  of its vast  km  sq mi land is arable the province is agriculturally rich particularly in the fraser and okanagan valleys because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction principally logging farming and mining vancouver the provinces largest city and metropolitan area also serves as the headquarters of many westernbased natural resource companies it also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average while the coast of british columbia and certain valleys in the southcentral part of the province have mild weather the majority of its land mass experiences a coldwintertemperate climate similar to that of the rest of canada the northern interior region has a subarctic climate with very cold winters the climate of vancouver is

british name for the territory drained by the columbia river in southeastern british columbia which was the namesake of the preoregon treaty columbia department of the hudsons bay company queen victoria chose british columbia to distinguish what was the british sector of the columbia district from that of the united states american columbia or southern columbia which became the oregon territory on august   as a result of the treaty ultimately the columbia in the name british columbia is derived from the name of the columbia rediviva an american ship which lent its name to the columbia river and later the wider region the columbia in the name columbia rediviva came from the name columbia for the new world or parts thereof a reference to christopher columbus geographyedit main article geography of british columbia british columbias geography is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief which has defined patterns of settlement and industry since colonization british columbia is bordered by the pacific ocean on the west side by the american state of alaska to the northwest and parts of the west on the north by yukon and the northwest territories on the east by the province of alberta and on the south by the states of washington idaho and montana the current southern border of british columbia was established by the  oregon treaty although its history is tied with lands as far south as california british columbias land area is  square kilometres  sq mi british columbias rugged coastline stretches for more than  kilometres  mi and includes deep mountainous fjords and about  islands most of which are uninhabited it is the only province in canada that borders the pacific ocean british columbias capital is victoria located at the southeastern tip of vancouver island only a narrow strip of the island from campbell river to victoria is significantly populated much of the western part of vancouver island and the rest of the coast is covered by thick tall and sometimes impenetrable temperate rainforest the provinces most populous city is vancouver which is located at the confluence of the fraser river and georgia strait in the southwest corner of the mainland an area often called the lower mainland by land area abbotsford is the largest city vanderhoof is near the geographic centre of the province the coast mountains and the inside passages many inlets provide some of british columbias renowned and spectacular scenery which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and ecotourism industry seventyfive percent of the province is mountainous more than  metres  ft above sea level  is forested and only about  is arable the provinces mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the pacific ocean terrain ranges from dry inland forests and semiarid in numerous valleys to the range and canyon districts of the central and southern interior to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the northern interior the okanagan area extending from near vernon to osoyoos at the united states border is one of several wine and ciderproducing regions in canada other wine regions in british columbia include the cowichan valley on vancouver island and the fraser valley the southern interior cities of kamloops and penticton have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in canada although their temperatures can be exceeded north of the fraser canyon close to the confluence of the fraser and thompson rivers where the terrain is rugged and covered with deserttype flora semidesert grassland is found in large areas of the interior plateau with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones the northern mostly mountainous twothirds of the province are largely unpopulated and undeveloped except for the area east of the rockies where the peace river district in the northeast of the province contains bcs portion of the canadian prairies centred at dawson creek climateedit köppen climate types in british columbia strait of georgia near vancouver coastal southern british columbia has a mild rainy oceanic climate some far southern parts of which are warmsummer mediterranean influenced by the north pacific current which has its origins in the kuroshio current due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges the climate of the interior of the province is semiarid with certain locations receiving less than  mm  in annual precipitation the annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to  °c  °f the mildest anywhere in canada the valleys of the southern interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow while those in the cariboo in the central interior are colder because of increased altitude and latitude but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in canada for example the average daily low in prince george roughly located in the middle of the province in january is − °c  °f heavy snowfall occurs in all elevated mountainous terrain providing bases for skiers in both south and central british columbia winters are generally severe in the northern interior but even there milder air can penetrate far inland the coldest temperature in british columbia was recorded in smith river where it dropped to − °c − °f on january   one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in north america atlin in the provinces far northwest along with the adjoining southern lakes region of yukon get midwinter thaws caused by the chinook effect which is also common and much warmer in more southerly parts of the interior during winter on the coast rainfall sometimes relentless heavy rain dominates because of consistent barrages of cyclonic lowpressure systems from the north pacific average snowfall on the coast during an average winter is between  and  cm  and  in but on occasion and not every winter heavy snowfalls with more than  cm  in and well below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas typically for short periods and can take temperatures below − °c  °f even at sea level and arctic outflow winds can make wind chill temperatures at or even below − °c  °f for a couple of mornings while winters are very wet coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer under the influence of stable anticyclonic high pressure southern interior valleys are hot in summer for example in osoyoos the july maximum temperature averages  °c  °f the hottest month of any place in canada this hot weather sometimes spreads towards the coast or to the far north of the province temperatures often exceed  °c  °f in the lower elevations of valleys in the interior during midsummer with the record high of  °c  °f being held in lytton on july   the okanagan region has a climate suitable to vineyards the extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires from drylightning or manmade causes many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during the winter months in contrast to abundant summer sunshine annual sunshine hours vary from  near cranbrook and victoria to less than  in prince rupert located on the north coast just south of the alaska panhandle the exception to

indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast indigenous peoples of the northwest plateau and the canadian crown and aboriginal peoples the area that is now known as british columbia is home to first nations groups that have a deep history with a significant percentage of indigenous languages there are more than  first nations in bc prior to contact with nonaboriginal people human history is known from archaeological investigations an oral history of first nations groups and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period the arrival of paleoindians from beringia took place between  and  years ago hunter gatherer families were the main social structure from  to  years ago the nomadic population lived in nonpermanent structures foraging for nuts berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs around  years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary lifestyle these indigenous populations evolved over the next  years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs to the northwest of the province are the peoples of the nadene languages which include the athapaskanspeaking peoples and the tlingit who lived on the islands of southern alaska and northern british columbia the nadene language group is believed to be linked to the yeniseian languages of siberia the dene of the western arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from asia to north america the interior of british columbia was home to the salishan language groups such as the shuswap secwepemc okanagan and athabaskan language groups primarily the dakelh carrier and the tsilhqotin the inlets and valleys of the british columbia coast sheltered large distinctive populations such as the haida kwakwakawakw and nuuchahnulth sustained by the regions abundant salmon and shellfish these peoples developed complex cultures dependent on the western red cedar that included wooden houses seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved potlatch items and totem poles contact with europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from europe that the people had no immunity to the result was a dramatic population collapse culminating in the  smallpox outbreak in victoria that spread throughout the coast european settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of british columbia colonial officials deemed that colonists could make better use of the land than the first nations people and thus the land territory be owned by the colonists to ensure colonists would be able to settle properly and make use of the land natives were relocated onto reserves which were often too small to support their way of life by the s over  reserves were located within british columbia fur trade and colonial

which took place in  juan francisco de la bodega y quadra explored the coast in  in doing so pérez and quadra reasserted the spanish claim for the pacific coast first made by vasco núñez de balboa in  the explorations of james cook in  and george vancouver in – established british jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the columbia river in  sir alexander mackenzie was the first european to journey across north america overland to the pacific ocean inscribing a stone marking his accomplishment on the shoreline of dean channel near bella coola his expedition theoretically established british sovereignty inland and a succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the canadian prairies and the pacific mackenzie and other explorers—notably john finlay simon fraser samuel black and david thompson—were primarily concerned with extending the fur trade rather than political considerations in  by the third of a series of agreements known as the nootka conventions spain conceded its claims of exclusivity in the pacific this opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers including britain but because of the napoleonic wars there was little british action on its claims in the region until later the establishment of trading posts under the auspices of the north west company and the hudsons bay company hbc effectively established a permanent british presence in the region the columbia district was broadly defined as being south of ° north latitude the southern limit of russian america north of mexicancontrolled california and west of the rocky mountains it was by the angloamerican convention of  under the joint occupancy and use of citizens of the united states and subjects of britain which is to say the fur companies this cooccupancy was ended with the oregon treaty of  the major supply route was the york factory express between hudson bay and fort vancouver some of the early outposts grew into settlements communities and cities among the places in british columbia that began as fur trading posts are fort st john established  hudsons hope  fort nelson  fort st james  prince george  kamloops  fort langley  fort victoria  yale  and nanaimo  fur company posts that became cities in what is now the united states include vancouver washington fort vancouver formerly the capital of hudsons bay operations in the columbia district colville washington and walla walla washington old fort nez percés with the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in  the region now comprising british columbia existed in three fur trading departments the bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the new caledonia district administered from fort st james the interior south of the thompson river watershed and north of the columbia was organized into the columbia district administered from fort vancouver on the lower columbia river the northeast corner of the province east of the rockies known as the peace river block was attached to the much larger athabasca district headquartered in fort chipewyan in presentday alberta until  these districts were a wholly unorganized area of british north america under the de facto jurisdiction of hbc administrators unlike ruperts land to the north and east however the territory was not a concession to the company rather it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the first nations inhabitants all that was changed with the westward extension of american exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty especially in the southern columbia basin within present day washington and oregon in  the oregon treaty divided the territory along the th parallel to the strait of georgia with the area south of this boundary excluding vancouver island and the gulf islands transferred to sole american sovereignty the colony of vancouver island was created in  with victoria designated as the capital new caledonia as the whole of the mainland rather than just its northcentral interior came to be called continued to be an unorganized territory of british north america administered by individual hbc trading post managers colony of british columbia –edit main articles colony of british columbia – and richard clement moody with the fraser canyon gold rush in  an influx of americans into new caledonia prompted the colonial office to designate the mainland as the colony of british columbia when news of the fraser canyon gold rush reached london richard clement moody was handpicked by the colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and found a second england on the shores of the pacific lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force he sought men who possessed courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the english gentleman and british officer at the head of the royal engineers columbia detachment moody and his family arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary in british columbia moody wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending miles to the right  left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities  yet fr the background of superb mountains swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbingport moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor later gold rushesedit a series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed the largest being the cariboo gold rush in  forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of farflung boom communities like barkerville and lillooet which sprang up overnight the vancouver island colony was facing financial crises of its own and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in  when the colony of british columbia was amalgamated with the colony of vancouver island to form the colony of british columbia – which was in turn succeeded by the present day province of british columbia following the canadian confederation of  rapid growth and developmentedit lord strathcona drives the last spike of the canadian pacific railway at craigellachie november   completion of the transcontinental railroad was a condition of entry into confederation the confederation league including such figures as amor de cosmos john robson and robert beaven led the chorus pressing for the colony to join canada which had been created out of three british north american colonies in  the province of canada nova scotia and new brunswick several factors motivated this agitation including the fear of annexation to the united states the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth the need for governmentfunded services to support this population and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush memorial last spike in craigellachie with the agreement by the canadian government to extend the canadian pacific railway to british columbia and to assume the colonys debt british columbia became the sixth province to join confederation on july   the borders of the province were not completely settled the treaty of washington sent the pig war san juan islands border dispute to arbitration in  and in  the provinces territory shrank again after the alaska boundary dispute settled the vague boundary of the alaska panhandle population in british columbia continued to expand as the provinces mining forestry agriculture and fishing sectors were developed mining activity was particularly notable throughout the mainland particularly in the boundary country in the slocan in the west kootenay around trail the east kootenay the southeast corner of the province the fraser canyon the cariboo the omineca and the cassiar so much so a common epithet for the mainland even after provincehood was the gold colony agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile fraser valley and cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the thompson river area the cariboo the chilcotin and the okanagan forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast which was also the locus of a growing fishery the completion of the railway in  was a huge boost to the provinces economy facilitating the transportation of the regions considerable resources to the east the milltown of granville known as gastown near the mouth of the burrard inlet was selected as the terminus of the railway prompting the incorporation of the city as vancouver in  the completion of the port of vancouver spurred rapid growth and in less than fifty years the city surpassed winnipeg manitoba as the largest in western canada the early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically its settlement and development—were paramount this included expropriation from first nations people of their land control over its resources as well as the ability to trade in some resources such as the fishery establishing a labour force to develop the province was problematic from the start and british columbia was the locus of immigration from europe china and japan the influx of a noncaucasian population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups resulting in agitation much of it successful to restrict the ability of asian people to immigrate to british columbia through the imposition of a head tax this resentment culminated in mob attacks against chinese and japanese immigrants in vancouver in  and  by  almost all chinese immigration had been blocked except for merchants professionals students and investors meanwhile the province continued to grow in  the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line the grand trunk pacific linking northcentral british columbia from the yellowhead pass through prince george to prince rupert was driven at fort fraser this opened up the north coast and the bulkley valley region to new economic opportunities what had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus for forestry farming and mining in world war i the province responded strongly to the call to assist the british empire against its german foes in french and belgian battlefields about  of the  british columbian residents the highest percapita rate in canada responded to the military needs horseriders from the provinces interior region and first nations soldiers made contributions to vimy ridge and other battles about  men from the province died in combat s through sedit when the men returned from world war i they discovered the recently enfranchised women of the province had helped vote in the prohibition of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hardcore drinking that vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war because of pressure from veterans prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the soldier and the working man could enjoy a drink but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by european immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of soldier parties to represent their interests variously named soldierfarmer soldierlabour and farmerlabour parties these formed the basis of the fractured labourpolitical spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties including those who would eventually form the cooperative commonwealth and the early social credit splinter groups internment camp for the japanese canadians during world war ii the advent of prohibition in the united states created new opportunities and many found employment or at least profit in crossborder liquor smuggling much of vancouvers prosperity and opulence in the s results from this pirate economy although growth in forestry fishing and mining continued the end of us prohibition combined with the onset of the great depression plunged the province into economic destitution compounding the already dire local economic situation tens of thousands of men from colder parts of canada swarmed into vancouver creating huge hobo jungles around false creek and the burrard inlet rail yards including the old canadian pacific railway mainline rightofway through the heart of the citys downtown at hastings and carrall increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts an occupation of the main post office at granville and hastings which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of martial law on the docks for almost three years a vancouver contingent for the ontoottawa trek was organized and seized a train which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a gatling gun straddling the tracks at mission the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the depression there were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the s but it was the onset of world war ii which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the depression because of the war effort women entered the workforce as never before british columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the pacific ocean to have close relations with east asia however this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward asian immigrants this was most manifest during the second world war when many people of japanese descent were relocated or interned in the interior of the province coalition and the postwar boomedit the bc regiment dcor marching in new westminster  during world war ii the mainstream bc liberal and bc conservative parties of british columbia united in a formal coalition government under new liberal leader john hart who replaced duff pattullo when the latter failed to win a majority in the  election while the liberals won the most number of seats they actually received fewer votes than the socialist cooperative commonwealth federation ccf pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival conservatives led by royal maitland and was replaced by hart who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five liberal and three conservative ministers the ccf was invited to join the coalition but refused the pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of world war ii was to prevent the ccf which had won a surprise victory in saskatchewan in  from ever coming to power in british columbia the ccfs popular vote was high enough in the  election that they were likely to have won threeway contests and could have formed government however the coalition prevented that by uniting the antisocialist vote in the postwar environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects notably the completion of highway  north of prince george to the peace river block a section called the john hart highway and also public hospital insurance in  the reins of the coalition were taken over by byron ingemar johnson the conservatives had wanted their new leader herbert anscomb to be premier but the liberals in the coalition refused johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in british columbia history  in the  election this victory was attributable to the popularity of his governments spending programmes despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power during his tenure major infrastructures continued to expand such as the agreement with alcan aluminum to build the town of kitimat with an aluminum smelter and the large kemano hydro project johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the  flooding of the fraser valley which was a major blow to that region and to the provinces economy increasing tension between the liberal and conservative coalition partners led the liberal party executive to vote to instruct johnson to terminate the arrangement johnson ended the coalition and dropped his conservative cabinet ministers including deputy premier and finance minister herbert anscomb precipitating the general election of  a referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot similar to a preferential ballot where voters could select second and third choices the intent of the ballot as campaigned for by liberals and conservatives was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the ccf but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties including the ccf voted for the fringe british columbia social credit party socreds who wound up with the largest number of seats in the house  only one seat ahead of the ccf despite the ccf having  of the vote to social credits  the social credit party led by rebel former conservative mla w a c bennett formed a minority government backed by the liberals and conservatives with  and  seats respectively bennett began a series of fiscal reforms preaching a new variety of populism as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development laying the ground for a second election in  in which the new bennett regime secured a majority of seats with  of the vote secure with that majority bennett returned the province to the firstpastthepost system thereafter which is still in use today –sedit with the election of the social credit party british columbia embarked on a phase of rapid economic development bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry mining and energy sectors during these two decades the government nationalized british columbia electric and the british columbia power company as well as smaller electric companies renaming the entity bc hydro west kootenay power and light remained independent of bc hydro being owned and operated by cominco though tied into the regional power grid by the end of the s several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the peace columbia and nechako river watersheds the nechako diversion to kemano was to supply power to the alcan inc aluminum smelter at kitimat and was not part of the provincial power grid but privately owned major transmission deals were concluded most notably the columbia river treaty between canada and the united states the provinces economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector as well as oil and gas development in the provinces northeast the s and s were also marked by development in the provinces transportation infrastructure in  the government established bc ferries as a crown corporation to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system also supported by federal grants as being part of the transcanada highway system that system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges and paving of existing highways and provincial roads vancouver and victoria became cultural centres as poets authors artists musicians as well as dancers actors and haute cuisine chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures with the cultural and entrepreneurial community notably bolstered by many draft dodgers from the united states similarly these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics commentators and creative thinkerscitation needed tourism also began to play an important role in the economy the rise of japan and other pacific economies was a great boost to british columbias economy primarily because of massive exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees politically and socially the s brought a period of significant social ferment the divide between the political left and right which had prevailed in the province since the depression and the rise of the labour movement sharpened as socalled free enterprise parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by social credit—in opposition to the social democratic new democratic party the successor to the cooperative commonwealth federation as the provinces economy blossomed so did labourmanagement tensions tensions emerged also from the counterculture movement of the late s of which vancouver and nanaimo were centres the conflict between hippies and vancouver mayor tom campbell was particularly legendary culminating in the socalled gastown riots of  by the end of the decade with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the status quo rising the bennett governments achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity s and sedit on august   the social credit party was reelected in a general election for what would be bennetts final term in power at the start of the s the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector however bc hydro reported its first loss which was the beginning of the end for bennett and the social credit party the socreds were forced from power in the august  election paving the way for a provincial new democratic party ndp government under dave barrett under barrett the large provincial surplus soon became a deficitcitation needed although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous social credit regime and its two sets of books as wac bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management the brief threeyear thousand days period of ndp governance brought several lasting changes to the province most notably the creation of the agricultural land reserve intended to protect farmland from redevelopment and the insurance corporation of british columbia a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing singlepayer basic automobile insurance perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too farreaching coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the ndp in the  general election social credit under wac bennetts son bill bennett was returned to office under the younger bennetts government  of the provinces land base was transferred from government reserve to management by the ministry of forests reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the premiers office and ndpinstigated social programs were rolled back with thenhuman resources minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy although the newera socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the ndp—notably the creation of the resort municipality of whistler whose special status including sunday drinking then an anomaly in bc also during the miniwac regime a reference to his fathers acronym wac certain moneylosing crownowned assets were privatized in a mass giveaway of shares in the british columbia resources investment corporation bcric with the brick shares soon becoming nearworthless towards the end of his tenure in power bennett oversaw the completion of several megaprojects meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most rightwing parties british columbias social credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy most notable of these was the winning of a worlds fair for vancouver which came in the form of expo  to which was tied the construction of the coquihalla highway and vancouvers skytrain system the coquihalla highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premiers brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal the doman scandal in which the premier and millionaire backer herb doman were investigated for insidertrading and securities fraud nonetheless the socreds were reelected in  under bennett who led the party until  the coquihalla highway the road was one of the legacies of the expo  worlds fair the creation of the toll highway sparked controversy as the province entered a sustained recession bennetts popularity and media image were in decline on april   premier bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government and the lieutenantgovernor henry pybus bellirving was forced to call bennett to government house to resolve the impasse and an election was called for april  while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the executive council no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis campaigning on a platform of moderation bennett won an unexpected majority after several weeks of silence in the aftermath a sitting of the house was finally called and in the speech from the throne the socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed restraint which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign the programme included cuts to motherhood issues of the left including the human rights branch the offices of the ombudsman and rentalsman womens programs environmental and cultural programs while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate british columbia this sparked a backlash with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to  people this became known as the  solidarity crisis from the name of the solidarity coalition a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized consisting of organized labour and community groups with the british columbia federation of labour forming a separate organization of unions operation solidarity under the direction of jack munro thenpresident of the international woodworkers of america iwa the most powerful of the provinces resource unions tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a general strike would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the ndp and the left just as a strike at pacific press ended which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the provinces major papers the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and iwa president jack munro and premier bennett a tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued as among the new laws were those enabling nonunion labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues with companies from alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with unionscale british columbia companies despite the tension bennetts last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with expo and bennett was to end his career by hosting prince charles and lady diana on their visit to open expo  his retirement being announced a social credit convention was scheduled for the whistler resort which came down to a threeway shooting match between bud smith the premiers righthand man but an unelected official social credit party grande dame grace mccarthy and the charismatic but eccentric bill vander zalm bill vander zalm became the new socred leader when smith threw his support to him rather than see mccarthy win and led the party to victory in the election later that year vander zalm was later involved in a conflict of interest scandal following the sale of fantasy gardens a christian and dutch culture theme park built by the premier to tan yu a filipino chinese gambling kingpin there were also concerns over yus application to the government for a bank licence and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor faye leung of a party in the howard hughes suite on the top two floors of the bayshore inn where tan yu had been staying with reports of a bag of money in a brown paper bag passed from yu to vander zalm during the goingson these scandals forced vander zalms resignation and rita johnston became premier of the province johnston presided over the end of social credit power calling an election which led to the reducing of the partys caucus to only two seats and the revival of the longdefunct british columbia liberal party as opposition to the victorious ndp under former vancouver mayor mike harcourt in  david lam was appointed as british columbia’s twentyfifth lieutenantgovernor and was the provinces first lieutenantgovernor of chinese origin s to presentedit this article needs to be updated please update this section to reflect recent events or newly available information august  johnston lost the  general election to the ndp under the leadership of mike harcourt a former mayor of vancouver the ndps unprecedented creation of new parkland and protected areas was popular and helped boost the provinces growing tourism sector however the economy continued to struggle against the backdrop of a weak resource economy housing starts and an expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade despite political turmoil harcourt ended up resigning over bingogate—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings harcourt was not implicated but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside glen clark a former president of the bc federation of labour was chosen the new leader of the ndp which won a second term in  more scandals dogged the party most notably the fast ferry scandal involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in british columbia an allegation never substantiated that the premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to clarks resignation as premier he was succeeded on an interim basis by dan miller who was in turn followed by ujjal dosanjh following a leadership convention in the  general election gordon campbells bc liberals defeated the ndp gaining  out of  total seats in the provincial legislature campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the ndps policies including scrapping the fast ferries project lowering income taxes and the controversial sale of bc rail to cn rail campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for driving under the influence during a vacation in hawaii however campbell still managed to lead his party to victory in the  general election against a substantially strengthened ndp opposition campbell won a third term in the british columbia general election  marking the first time in  years that a premier has been elected to a third term the province won a bid to host the  winter olympics in vancouver and whistler as promised in his  reelection campaign vancouver mayor larry campbell staged a nonbinding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the olympics in february  vancouvers residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid sixtyfour percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games after the olympic joy had faded campbells popularity started to fall his management style the implementation of the harmonized sales tax hst against election promises and the cancelling of the bc rail corruption trial lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support he would resign in november  and call on the party to elect a new leader in early  christy clark former deputy premier would become leader of the liberal party though she was not currently a sitting mla she would go on to win the seat left vacant by campbell and form a government for the next two years she would attempt to distance herself from the unpopularity of campbell and forge an image for the upcoming election among her early accomplishments she raised the minimum wage created the new holiday of family day and pushed the development of bcs liquified natural gas in the  election the liberals lagged behind the ndp with a doubledigit gap in the polls but were able to come to a surprise victory on election night with a majority making clark the first elected female premier in bc history while clark lost her seat to ndp candidate david eby she later won a byelection in the riding of westsidekelowna her government would go on to balance the budget implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed enbridge northern gateway pipelines then in the  election the ndp would form a minority government with the support from the green party with just a slight edge over the liberal party  in the legislature then on july th the leader of the bc ndp john horgan would officially be sworn in as premier of british columbia with bc green party leader andrew weaver by his side british columbia has also been significantly affected by demographic changes within canada and around the world vancouver and to a lesser extent some other parts of british columbia was a major destination for many of the immigrants from hong kong who left the former uk colony either temporarily or permanently in the years immediately prior to its handover to the peoples republic of china british columbia has also been a significant destination for internal canadian migrants this has been the case throughout recent decades because of its image of natural beauty mild climate and relaxed lifestyle but is particularly true during periods of economic growth as a result british columbia has moved from approximately  of canadas population in  to approximately  in

forestry industry but also with fluctuating importance in mining employment in the resource sector has fallen steadily as a percentage of employment and new jobs are mostly in the construction and retailservice sectors it now has the highest percentage of service industry jobs in the west comprising  of industry compared to  western canadian average the largest section of this employment is in finance insurance real estate and corporate management many areas outside of metropolitan areas however are still heavily reliant on resource extraction with its film industry known as hollywood north the vancouver region is the thirdlargest feature film production location in north america after los angeles and new york city the economic history of british columbia is replete with tales of dramatic upswings and downswings and this boom and bust pattern has influenced the politics culture and business climate of the province economic activity related to mining in particular has widely

general in council may appoint an administrator to execute the duties of the office in practice this is usually the chief justice of british columbia british columbia has an member elected legislative assembly elected by the plurality voting system though in recent years there has been significant debate about switching to a single transferable vote system the government of the day appoints ministers for various portfolios what are officially part of the executive council of british columbia cabinet of whom the premier is chair the province is currently governed by the british columbia new democratic party bc ndp under premierdesignate john horgan the  provincial election saw the liberal party take  seats the ndp take  and the british columbia green party take  no party met the minimum of  seats for a majority therefore leading to the first minority government since  following the election the greens entered into negotiations with both the liberals and ndp eventually announcing that they would support the current ndp minority previously the rightofcentre british columbia liberal party governed the province for sixteen years between  and  and won the largest landslide election in british columbia history in  with  of  seats the legislature became more evenly divided however between the liberals and ndp following the   liberal seats of  and   liberal seats of  provincial elections the ndp and its predecessor the ccf have been the main opposition force to rightwing parties since the s and have ruled with majority governments in – and – the green party plays a larger role in the politics of british columbia than green parties do in most other jurisdictions in canada after a breakthrough election in   the partys vote share declined  –   –     before increasing again to a record high of  at the  election the british columbia liberal party is not related to the federal liberal party and does not share the same ideology instead the bc liberal party is a rather diverse coalition made up of the remnants of the social credit party many federal liberals federal conservatives and those who would otherwise support rightofcentre or free enterprise parties historically there have commonly been third parties present in the legislature including the liberals themselves from  to  the bc green party are the current third party in british columbia with three seats in the legislature prior to the rise of the liberal party british columbias main political party was the british columbia social credit party which ruled british columbia for  continuous years while sharing some ideology with the current liberal government they were more rightwing although undertook nationalization of various important monopolies notably bc hydro and bc ferries the meeting chamber of the provincial legislative assembly british columbia is known for having politically active labour unions who have traditionally supported the ndp or its predecessor the ccf british columbias political history is typified by scandal and a cast of colourful characters beginning with various colonialera land scandals and abuses of power by early officials such as those that led to mcgowans war in – notable scandals in social credit years included the robert bonner affair and the fantasy gardens scandal which forced premier bill vander zalm to resign and ended the social credit era ndp scandals included bingogate which brought down ndp premier mike harcourt and the alleged scandal named casinogate which drove ndp premier glen clark to resign a variety of scandals plagued the  liberal government including premier gordon campbells arrest for drunk driving in maui and the resignation of various cabinet ministers because of conflictofinterest allegations a christmas evewhich raid on the parliament buildings in victoria including the premiers office has resulted in charges only for ministerial aides although key cabinet members from the time have since resigned the case currently in preliminary hearings in the courts and relating to the sale of bc rail to cn rail may not reach trial because of the mass of evidence and various procedural problemscitation needed campbell eventually resigned in late  due to opposition to his governments plan to introduce a harmonized sales tax hst and was replaced by christy clark as premier in a  bc liberal leadership election british columbia is underrepresented in the senate of canada leading premier christy clark to refuse to cooperate with the federal governments new reforms for senate appointments to be made based on the recommendations of a new advisory board that would use nonpartisan criteria hours after that plan was unveiled in ottawa on december   clark issued a statement that it did not address what’s been wrong with the senate since the beginning the imbalance in representation in that house is apparent when considering population size the six senators from bc constitute only one for every  people vs one for every  in pei which has four senators nova scotia and new brunswick have much smaller populations than bc yet each has ten senators according to a global news summary correcting this imbalance would require a constitutional amendment but that is unlikely to be supported by the atlantic provinces official symbolsedit the flower of the pacific

role in british columbias history the rocky mountains and the ranges west of them constituted a significant obstacle to overland travel until the completion of the transcontinental railway in  the peace river canyon through the rocky mountains was the route that the earliest explorers and fur traders used fur trade routes were only marginally used for access to british columbia through the mountains travel from the rest of canada before  meant the difficulty of overland travel via the united states around cape horn or overseas from asia nearly all travel and freight to and from the region occurred via the pacific ocean primarily through the ports of victoria and new westminster until the s rail was the only means of overland travel to and from the rest of canada travellers using

mainland and central interior of the province much of the rest of the province where traffic volumes are generally low is accessible by wellmaintained generally highmobility twolane arterial highways with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas and usually only a few stopcontrolled intersections outside the main urban areas a couple of busy intercity corridors outside greater vancouver feature more heavily signalized limitedmobility arterial highways that are mostly fourlane and often divided by portable median traffic barriers highway  on vancouver island and highway  through the okanagan valley are medium to highvolume roadways with variable posted speeds that range from  kmh to maximums just slightly lower than the principal gradeseparated highways numerous traffic lights operate in place of interchanges on both arterials as longterm costcutting measures signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along interurban sections where traffic volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of highmobility alternative routes or bypasses the building and maintenance of provincial highways is the responsibility of the british columbia ministry of transportation and infrastructure there are only five major routes to the rest of canada from

geography is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief which has defined patterns of settlement and industry since colonization british columbia is bordered by the pacific ocean on the west side by the american state of alaska to the northwest and parts of the west on the north by yukon and the northwest territories on the east by the province of alberta and on the south by the states of washington idaho and montana the current southern border of british columbia was established by the  oregon treaty although its history is tied with lands as far south as california british columbias land area is  square kilometres  sq mi british columbias rugged coastline stretches for more than  kilometres  mi and includes deep mountainous fjords and about  islands most of

the island from campbell river to victoria is significantly populated much of the western part of vancouver island and the rest of the coast is covered by thick tall and sometimes impenetrable temperate rainforest the provinces most populous city is vancouver which is located at the confluence of the fraser river and georgia strait in the southwest corner of the mainland an area often called the lower mainland by land area abbotsford is the largest city vanderhoof is near the geographic centre of the province the coast mountains and the inside passages many inlets provide some of

forests and semiarid in numerous valleys to the range and canyon districts of the central and southern interior to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the northern interior the okanagan area extending from near vernon to osoyoos at the united states border is one of several wine and ciderproducing regions in canada other wine regions in british columbia include the cowichan valley on vancouver island and the fraser valley the southern interior cities of kamloops and penticton have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in canada although their temperatures can be exceeded

first nations groups and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period the arrival of paleoindians from beringia took place between  and  years ago hunter gatherer families were the main social structure from  to  years ago the nomadic population lived in nonpermanent structures foraging for nuts berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs around  years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary lifestyle these indigenous populations evolved over the next  years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs to the northwest of the province are the peoples of the nadene languages which include the athapaskanspeaking peoples and the tlingit who lived on the islands of southern alaska and northern british columbia the nadene language group is believed to be linked to the yeniseian languages of siberia the dene of the western arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from asia to north america the interior of british columbia was home to the salishan language groups such as the shuswap secwepemc okanagan and athabaskan language groups primarily the dakelh carrier and the tsilhqotin the inlets and valleys of the british columbia coast sheltered large distinctive populations such as the haida kwakwakawakw and nuuchahnulth sustained by the regions abundant salmon and shellfish these peoples developed complex cultures dependent on the western red cedar that included wooden houses seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved potlatch items and totem poles contact with europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from europe that the people had no immunity to the result was a dramatic population collapse culminating in the  smallpox outbreak in victoria that spread throughout the coast european settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of british columbia colonial officials deemed that colonists could make better use of the land than the

of exclusivity in the pacific this opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers including britain but because of the napoleonic wars there was little british action on its claims in the region until later the establishment of trading posts under the auspices of the north west company and the hudsons bay company hbc effectively established a permanent british presence in the region the columbia district was broadly defined as being south of ° north latitude the southern limit of russian america north of mexicancontrolled california and west of the rocky mountains it was

the bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the new caledonia district administered from fort st james the interior south of the thompson river watershed and north of the columbia was organized into the columbia district administered from fort vancouver on the lower columbia river the northeast corner of the province east of the rockies known as the peace river block was attached to the much larger athabasca district headquartered in fort chipewyan in presentday alberta until  these districts were a wholly unorganized area of british north america under the de facto jurisdiction of hbc administrators unlike ruperts land to the north and east however the territory was not a concession to the company rather it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the first nations inhabitants all that was changed with the westward extension of american exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty especially in the southern columbia basin within present day washington and oregon in  the oregon treaty divided the territory along the th parallel to the strait of georgia with the area south of this boundary excluding vancouver island and the gulf islands transferred to sole american sovereignty the colony of vancouver island was created in  with victoria designated as the capital new caledonia as the whole of the mainland rather than

main articles colony of british columbia – and richard clement moody with the fraser canyon gold rush in  an influx of americans into new caledonia prompted the colonial office to designate the mainland as the colony of british columbia when news of the fraser canyon gold rush reached london richard clement moody was handpicked by the colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and found a second england on the shores of the pacific lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force he sought men who possessed courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the english gentleman and british officer at the head of the royal engineers columbia detachment moody and his family arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary in british columbia moody wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending miles to the right  left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities  yet fr the background of superb mountains swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbingport moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor later gold rushesedit a series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed the largest being the cariboo gold rush in  forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of farflung boom communities like barkerville and lillooet which sprang up overnight the vancouver island colony was facing financial crises of its own and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in  when the colony of british columbia was amalgamated with the colony of vancouver island to form the colony of british

of the canadian pacific railway at craigellachie november   completion of the transcontinental railroad was a condition of entry into confederation the confederation league including such figures as amor de cosmos john robson and robert beaven led the chorus pressing for the colony to join canada which had been created out of three british north american colonies in  the province of canada nova scotia and new brunswick several factors motivated this agitation including the fear of annexation to the united states the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth the need for governmentfunded services to support this population and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush memorial last spike in craigellachie with the agreement by the canadian government

cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the thompson river area the cariboo the chilcotin and the okanagan forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast which was also the locus of a growing fishery the completion of the railway in  was a huge boost to the provinces economy facilitating the transportation of the regions considerable resources to the east the milltown of granville known as gastown near the mouth of the burrard inlet was selected as the terminus of the railway prompting the incorporation of the city as vancouver in  the completion of the port of vancouver spurred rapid growth and in less than fifty years the city surpassed winnipeg manitoba as the largest in western canada the early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically its settlement and development—were paramount this included expropriation from first nations people of their land control over its resources as well as the ability to trade in some resources such as the fishery establishing a labour force to develop the province was problematic from the start and british columbia was the locus of immigration from europe china and japan the influx of a noncaucasian population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups resulting in agitation much of it successful to restrict the ability of asian people to immigrate to british columbia through the imposition of a head tax this resentment culminated in mob attacks against chinese and japanese immigrants in vancouver in  and  by  almost all chinese immigration had been blocked except for merchants professionals students and investors meanwhile the province continued to grow in  the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line the

social problems associated with the hardcore drinking that vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war because of pressure from veterans prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the soldier and the working man could enjoy a drink but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by european immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of soldier parties to represent their interests variously named soldierfarmer soldierlabour and farmerlabour parties these formed the basis of the fractured labourpolitical spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties including those who would eventually form the cooperative commonwealth and the early social credit splinter groups internment camp for

depression plunged the province into economic destitution compounding the already dire local economic situation tens of thousands of men from colder parts of canada swarmed into vancouver creating huge hobo jungles around false creek and the burrard inlet rail yards including the old canadian pacific railway mainline rightofway through the heart of the citys downtown at hastings and carrall increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts an occupation of the main post office at granville and hastings which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of martial law on the docks for almost three years a vancouver contingent for the ontoottawa trek was organized and seized a train which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a gatling gun straddling the tracks at mission the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the depression there were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the s but it was the onset of world war ii which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the depression because of the war effort women entered the workforce as never before british columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the pacific ocean to have close relations with east asia however this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward asian immigrants this was most manifest during the second world war when many people of japanese descent were relocated or interned in the interior of the province coalition and the postwar boomedit the bc regiment dcor marching in new westminster  during world war ii the mainstream bc liberal and bc conservative parties of british columbia united in a formal coalition government under new liberal leader john hart who replaced duff pattullo when the latter failed to win a majority in the  election while the liberals won the most number of seats they actually received fewer votes than the socialist cooperative commonwealth federation ccf pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival conservatives led by royal maitland and was replaced by hart who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five liberal and three conservative ministers the ccf was invited to join the coalition but refused the pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of world war ii was to prevent the ccf which had won a surprise victory in saskatchewan in  from ever coming to power in british columbia the ccfs popular vote was high enough in the  election that they were likely to have won threeway contests and could have formed government however the coalition prevented that by uniting the antisocialist vote in the postwar environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects notably the completion of highway  north of prince george to the peace river block a section called the john hart highway and also public hospital insurance in  the reins of the coalition were taken over by byron ingemar johnson the conservatives had wanted their new leader herbert anscomb to be premier but the liberals in the coalition refused johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in british columbia history  in the  election this victory was attributable to the popularity of his governments spending programmes despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power during his tenure major infrastructures continued to expand such as the agreement with alcan aluminum to build the town of kitimat with an aluminum smelter and the large kemano hydro project johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the  flooding of the fraser valley which was a major blow to that region and to the provinces economy increasing tension between the liberal and conservative coalition partners led the liberal party executive to vote to instruct johnson to terminate the arrangement johnson ended the coalition and dropped his conservative cabinet ministers including deputy premier and finance minister herbert anscomb precipitating the general election of  a referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot similar to a preferential ballot where voters could select second and third choices the intent of the ballot as campaigned for by liberals and conservatives was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the ccf but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties including the ccf voted for the fringe british columbia social credit party socreds who wound up with the largest number of seats in the house  only one seat ahead of the ccf despite the ccf having  of the vote to social credits  the social credit party led by rebel former conservative mla w a c bennett formed a minority government backed by the liberals and conservatives with  and  seats respectively bennett began a series of fiscal reforms preaching a new variety of populism as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development laying the ground for a second election in  in which the new bennett regime secured a majority of seats with  of the vote secure with that majority bennett returned the province to the firstpastthepost system thereafter which is still in use today –sedit with the election of the social credit party british columbia embarked on a phase of rapid economic development bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry mining and energy sectors during these two decades the government nationalized british columbia electric and the british columbia power company as well as smaller electric companies renaming the entity bc hydro west kootenay power and light remained independent of bc hydro being owned and operated by cominco though tied into the regional power grid by the end of the s several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the peace columbia and nechako river watersheds the nechako diversion to kemano was to supply power to the alcan inc aluminum smelter at kitimat and was not part of the provincial power grid but privately owned major transmission deals were concluded most notably the columbia river treaty between canada and the united states the provinces economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector as well as oil and gas development in the provinces northeast the s and s were also marked by development in the provinces transportation infrastructure in  the government established bc ferries as a crown corporation to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system also supported by federal grants as being part of the transcanada highway system that system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges and paving of existing highways and provincial roads vancouver and victoria became cultural centres as poets authors artists musicians as well as dancers actors and haute cuisine chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures with the cultural and entrepreneurial community notably bolstered by many draft dodgers from the united states similarly these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics commentators and creative thinkerscitation needed tourism also began to play an important role in the economy the rise of japan and other pacific economies was a great boost to british columbias economy primarily because of massive exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees politically and socially the s brought a period of significant social ferment the divide between the political left and right which had prevailed in the province since the depression and the rise of the labour movement sharpened as socalled free enterprise parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by social credit—in opposition to the social democratic new democratic party the successor to the cooperative commonwealth federation as the provinces economy blossomed so did labourmanagement tensions tensions emerged also from the counterculture movement of the late s of which vancouver and nanaimo were centres the conflict between hippies and vancouver mayor tom campbell was particularly legendary culminating in the socalled gastown riots of  by the end of the decade with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the status quo rising the bennett governments achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity s and sedit on august   the social credit party was reelected in a general election for what would be bennetts final term in power at the start of the s the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector however bc hydro reported its first loss which was the beginning of the end for bennett and the social credit party the socreds were forced from power in the august  election paving the way for a provincial new democratic party ndp government under dave barrett under barrett the large provincial surplus soon became a deficitcitation needed although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous social credit regime and its two sets of books as wac bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management the brief threeyear thousand days period of ndp governance brought several lasting changes to the province most notably the creation of the agricultural land reserve intended to protect farmland from redevelopment and the insurance corporation of british columbia a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing singlepayer basic automobile insurance perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too farreaching coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the ndp in the  general election social credit under wac bennetts son bill bennett was returned to office under the younger bennetts government  of the provinces land base was transferred from government reserve to management by the ministry of forests reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the premiers office and ndpinstigated social programs were rolled back with thenhuman resources minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy although the newera socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the ndp—notably the creation of the resort municipality of whistler whose special status including sunday drinking then an anomaly in bc also during the miniwac regime a reference to his fathers acronym wac certain moneylosing crownowned assets were privatized in a mass giveaway of shares in the british columbia resources investment corporation bcric with the brick shares soon becoming nearworthless towards the end of his tenure in power bennett oversaw the completion of several megaprojects meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most rightwing parties british columbias social credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy most notable of these was the winning of a worlds fair for vancouver which came in the form of expo  to which was tied the construction of the coquihalla highway and vancouvers skytrain system the coquihalla highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premiers brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal the doman scandal in which the premier and millionaire backer herb doman were investigated for insidertrading and securities fraud nonetheless the socreds were reelected in  under bennett who led the party until  the coquihalla highway the road was one of the legacies of the expo  worlds fair the creation of the toll highway sparked controversy as the province entered a sustained recession bennetts popularity and media image were in decline on april   premier bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government and the lieutenantgovernor henry pybus bellirving was forced to call bennett to government house to resolve the impasse and an election was called for april  while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the executive council no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis campaigning on a platform of moderation bennett won an unexpected majority after several weeks of silence in the aftermath a sitting of the house was finally called and in the speech from the throne the socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed restraint which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign the programme included cuts to motherhood issues of the left including the human rights branch the offices of the ombudsman and rentalsman womens programs environmental and cultural programs while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate british columbia this sparked a backlash with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to  people this became known as the  solidarity crisis from the name of the solidarity coalition a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized consisting of organized labour and community groups with the british columbia federation of labour forming a separate organization of unions operation solidarity under the direction of jack munro thenpresident of the international woodworkers of america iwa the most powerful of the provinces resource unions tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a general strike would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the ndp and the left just as a strike at pacific press ended which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the provinces major papers the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and iwa president jack munro and premier bennett a tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued as among the new laws were those enabling nonunion labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues with companies from alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with unionscale british columbia companies despite the tension bennetts last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with expo and bennett was to end his career by hosting prince charles and lady diana on their visit to open expo  his retirement being announced a social credit convention was scheduled for the whistler resort which came down to a threeway shooting match between bud smith the premiers righthand man but an unelected official social credit party grande dame grace mccarthy and the charismatic but eccentric bill vander zalm bill vander zalm became the new socred leader when smith threw his support to him rather than see mccarthy win and led the party to victory in the election later that year vander zalm was later involved in a conflict of interest scandal following the sale of fantasy gardens a christian and dutch culture theme park built by the premier to tan yu a filipino chinese gambling kingpin there were also concerns over yus application to the government for a bank licence and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor faye leung of a party in the howard hughes suite on the top two floors of the bayshore inn where tan yu had been staying with reports of a bag of money in a brown paper bag passed from yu to vander zalm during the goingson these scandals forced vander zalms resignation and rita johnston became premier of the province johnston presided over the end of social credit power calling an election which led to the reducing of the partys caucus to only two seats and the revival of the longdefunct british columbia liberal party as opposition to the victorious ndp under

over bingogate—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings harcourt was not implicated but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside glen clark a former president of the bc federation of labour was chosen the new leader of the ndp which won a second term in  more scandals dogged the party most notably the fast ferry scandal involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in british columbia an allegation never substantiated that the premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to clarks resignation as premier he was succeeded on an interim basis by dan miller who was in turn followed by ujjal dosanjh following a leadership convention in the  general election gordon campbells bc liberals defeated the ndp gaining  out of  total seats in the provincial legislature campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the ndps policies including scrapping the fast ferries project lowering income taxes and the controversial sale of bc rail to cn rail campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for driving under the influence during a vacation in hawaii however campbell still managed to lead his party to victory in the  general election against a substantially strengthened ndp opposition campbell won a third term in the british columbia general election  marking the first time in  years that a premier has been elected to a third term the province won a bid to host the  winter olympics in vancouver and whistler as promised in his  reelection campaign vancouver mayor larry campbell staged a nonbinding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the olympics in february  vancouvers residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid sixtyfour percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games after the olympic joy had faded campbells popularity started to fall his management style the implementation of the harmonized sales tax hst against election promises and the cancelling of the bc rail corruption trial lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support he would resign in november  and call on the party to elect a new leader in early  christy clark former deputy premier would become leader of the liberal party though she was not currently a sitting mla she would go on to win the seat left vacant by campbell and form a government for the next two years she would attempt to distance herself from the unpopularity of campbell and forge an image for the upcoming election among her early accomplishments she raised the minimum wage created the new holiday of family day and pushed the development of bcs liquified natural gas in the  election the liberals lagged behind the ndp with a doubledigit gap in the polls but were able to come to a surprise victory on election night with a majority making clark the first elected female premier in bc history while clark lost her seat to ndp candidate david eby she later won a byelection in the riding of westsidekelowna her government would go on to balance the budget implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed enbridge northern gateway pipelines then in the  election the ndp would form a minority government with the support from the green party with just a slight edge over the liberal party  in the legislature then on july th the leader of the bc ndp john horgan would officially be sworn in as premier of british columbia with bc green party leader andrew weaver by his side british columbia has also been significantly affected by demographic changes within canada

what is now british columbia by  first nations the original inhabitants of the land have a history of at least  years in the area today there are few treaties and the question of aboriginal title long ignored has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions notably the tsilhqotin nation has established aboriginal title to a portion of their territory

the provinces gdp it is the endpoint of transcontinental railways and the site of major pacific ports that enable international trade though less than  of its vast  km  sq mi land is arable the province is agriculturally rich particularly in the fraser and okanagan valleys because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction principally logging farming and mining vancouver the provinces largest city and metropolitan area also serves as the headquarters of many westernbased natural resource companies it also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average while the coast of british

colony of british columbia ie the mainland became a british colony in  it refers to the columbia district the british name for the territory drained by the columbia river in southeastern british columbia which was the namesake of the preoregon treaty columbia department of the hudsons bay company queen victoria chose british columbia to distinguish what was the british sector of the columbia district from that of the united states american columbia or southern columbia which became the oregon territory on august   as a result of the treaty ultimately the columbia in the name british columbia is derived from the name of the columbia rediviva an american ship which lent its name to the columbia river and later the wider region the columbia in the name columbia rediviva came from the name columbia for the new world or parts thereof a reference to christopher columbus geographyedit main article geography of british columbia british columbias geography is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief which has defined patterns of settlement and industry since colonization british columbia is bordered by the pacific ocean on the west side by the american state of alaska to the northwest and parts of the west on the north by yukon and the northwest territories on the east by the province of alberta and on the south by the states of washington idaho and montana the current southern border of british columbia was established by the  oregon treaty although its history is tied with lands as far south as california british columbias land area is  square kilometres  sq mi british columbias rugged coastline stretches for more than  kilometres  mi and includes deep mountainous fjords and about  islands most of which are uninhabited it is the only province in canada that borders the pacific ocean british columbias capital is victoria located at the southeastern tip of vancouver island only a narrow strip of the island from campbell river to victoria is significantly populated much of the western part of vancouver island and the rest of the coast is covered by thick tall and sometimes impenetrable temperate rainforest the provinces most populous city is vancouver which is located at the confluence of the fraser river and georgia strait in the southwest corner of the mainland an area often called the lower mainland by land area abbotsford is the largest city vanderhoof is near the geographic centre of the province the coast mountains and the inside passages many inlets provide some of british columbias renowned and spectacular scenery which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and ecotourism industry seventyfive percent of the province is mountainous more than  metres  ft above sea level  is forested and only about  is arable the provinces mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the pacific ocean terrain ranges from dry inland forests and semiarid in numerous valleys to the range and canyon districts of the central and southern interior to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the northern interior the okanagan area extending from near vernon to osoyoos at the united states border is one of several wine and ciderproducing regions in canada other wine regions in british columbia include the cowichan valley on vancouver island and the fraser valley the southern interior cities of kamloops and penticton have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in canada although their temperatures can be exceeded north of the fraser canyon close to the confluence of the fraser and thompson rivers where the terrain is rugged and covered with deserttype flora semidesert grassland is found in large areas of the interior plateau with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones the northern mostly mountainous twothirds of the province are largely unpopulated and undeveloped except for the area east of the rockies where the peace river district in the northeast of the province contains bcs portion of the canadian prairies centred at dawson creek climateedit köppen climate types in british columbia strait of georgia near vancouver coastal southern british columbia has a mild rainy oceanic climate some far southern parts of which are warmsummer mediterranean influenced by the north pacific current which has its origins in the kuroshio current due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges the climate of the interior of the province is semiarid with certain locations receiving less than  mm  in annual precipitation the annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to  °c  °f the mildest anywhere in canada the valleys of the southern interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow while those in the cariboo in the central interior are colder because of increased altitude and latitude but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in canada for example the average daily low in prince george roughly located in the middle of the province in january is − °c  °f

more than  first nations in bc prior to contact with nonaboriginal people human history is known from archaeological investigations an oral history of first nations groups and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period the arrival of paleoindians from beringia took place between  and  years ago hunter gatherer families were the main social structure from  to  years ago the nomadic population lived in nonpermanent structures foraging for nuts berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs around  years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary lifestyle these indigenous populations evolved over the next  years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs to the northwest of the province are the peoples of the nadene languages which include the athapaskanspeaking peoples and the tlingit who lived on the islands of southern alaska and northern british columbia the nadene language group is believed to be linked to the yeniseian languages of siberia the dene of the western arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from asia to north america the interior of british columbia was home to the salishan language groups such as the shuswap secwepemc okanagan and athabaskan language groups primarily the dakelh carrier and the tsilhqotin the inlets and valleys of the british columbia coast sheltered large

cedar that included wooden houses seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved potlatch items and totem poles contact with europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from europe that the people had no immunity to the result was a dramatic population collapse culminating in the  smallpox outbreak in victoria that spread throughout the coast european settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of british columbia colonial officials deemed that colonists could make better use of the land than the first nations people and thus the land

extending the fur trade rather than political considerations in  by the third of a series of agreements known as the nootka conventions spain conceded its claims of exclusivity in the pacific this opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers including britain but because of the napoleonic wars there was little british action on its claims in the region until later the establishment of trading posts under the auspices of the north west company and the hudsons bay company hbc effectively established a permanent british presence in the region the columbia district was broadly defined as being south of ° north latitude the southern limit of russian america north of mexicancontrolled california and west of the rocky mountains it was by the angloamerican convention of

interior was organized into the new caledonia district administered from fort st james the interior south of the thompson river watershed and north of the columbia was organized into the columbia district administered from fort vancouver on the lower columbia river the northeast corner of the province east of the rockies known as the peace river block was attached to the much larger athabasca district headquartered in fort chipewyan in presentday alberta until  these districts were a wholly unorganized area of british north america under the de facto jurisdiction of hbc administrators unlike ruperts land to the north and east however the territory was not a concession to the company rather it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the first nations inhabitants all that was changed with the westward extension of american exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty especially in the southern columbia basin within present day washington and oregon in  the oregon treaty divided the territory along the th parallel to the strait of georgia with the area south of this boundary excluding vancouver island and the gulf islands transferred to sole american sovereignty the colony of vancouver island was created in  with victoria designated as the capital new caledonia as the whole of the mainland rather than just its northcentral

transform the newly established colony of british columbia into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and found a second england on the shores of the pacific lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force he sought men who possessed courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the english gentleman and british officer at the head of the royal engineers columbia detachment moody and his family arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary in british columbia moody wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty

sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbingport moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor later gold rushesedit a series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed the largest being the cariboo gold rush in  forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of farflung boom communities like barkerville and lillooet which sprang up overnight the vancouver island colony was facing financial crises of its own and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in  when the colony of british columbia was amalgamated with the colony of vancouver island to form the colony of british columbia

and new brunswick several factors motivated this agitation including the fear of annexation to the united states the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth the need for governmentfunded

ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the thompson river area the cariboo the chilcotin and the okanagan forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast which was also the locus of a growing fishery the completion of the railway in  was a huge boost to the provinces economy facilitating the transportation of the regions considerable resources to the east the milltown of granville known as gastown near the mouth of the burrard inlet was selected as the terminus of the railway prompting the incorporation of the city as vancouver in  the completion of the port of vancouver spurred rapid growth and in less than fifty years the city surpassed winnipeg manitoba as the largest in western canada the early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically its settlement and development—were paramount this included expropriation from first nations people of their land control over its resources as well as the ability to trade in some resources such as the fishery establishing a labour force to develop the province was problematic from the start and british columbia was the locus of immigration from europe china and japan the influx of a noncaucasian population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups resulting in agitation much of it successful to restrict the ability of asian people to immigrate to british columbia through the imposition of a head tax this resentment culminated in mob attacks against chinese and japanese immigrants in vancouver in  and  by  almost all chinese immigration had been blocked except for merchants professionals students and investors meanwhile the province continued to grow in  the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line the grand trunk pacific

economic opportunities what had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus for forestry farming and mining in world war i the province responded strongly to the call to assist the british empire against its german foes in french and belgian battlefields about  of the  british columbian residents the highest percapita rate in canada responded to the military needs horseriders from the provinces interior region and first nations soldiers made contributions to vimy ridge and other battles about  men from the province died in combat s through sedit when the men returned from world war i they discovered the recently enfranchised women of the province had helped vote in the prohibition of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hardcore drinking that vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war because of pressure from veterans prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the soldier and the working man could enjoy a drink but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by european immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of soldier parties to represent their interests variously named soldierfarmer soldierlabour and farmerlabour parties these formed the basis of the fractured labourpolitical spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties including those who would eventually form the cooperative commonwealth and the early social credit splinter groups internment camp for the japanese canadians during world war ii the advent of prohibition in the united states created new opportunities and many found employment or at least profit in crossborder liquor smuggling much of vancouvers prosperity and opulence in the s results from this pirate economy although growth in forestry fishing and mining continued the end of us prohibition combined with the onset of the great depression plunged the province into economic destitution compounding the already dire local economic situation tens of thousands of men from colder parts of canada swarmed into vancouver creating huge hobo jungles around false creek and the burrard inlet rail yards including the old canadian pacific railway mainline rightofway through the heart of the citys downtown at hastings and carrall increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts an occupation of the main post office at granville and hastings which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of martial law on the docks for almost three years a vancouver contingent for the ontoottawa trek was organized and seized a train which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a gatling gun straddling the tracks at mission the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the depression there were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the s but it was the onset of world war ii which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the depression because of the war effort women entered the workforce as never before british columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the pacific ocean to have close relations with east asia however this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward asian immigrants this was most manifest during the second world war when many people of japanese descent were relocated or interned in the interior of the province coalition and the postwar boomedit the bc regiment dcor marching in new westminster  during world war ii the mainstream bc liberal and bc conservative parties of british columbia united in a formal coalition government under new liberal leader john hart who replaced duff pattullo when the latter failed to win a majority in the  election while the liberals won the most number of seats they actually received fewer votes than the socialist cooperative commonwealth federation ccf pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival conservatives led by royal maitland and was replaced by hart who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five liberal and three conservative ministers the ccf was invited to join the coalition but refused the pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of world war ii was to prevent the ccf which had won a surprise victory in saskatchewan in  from ever coming to power in british columbia the ccfs popular vote was high enough in the  election that they were likely to have won threeway contests and could have formed government however the coalition prevented that by uniting the antisocialist vote in the postwar environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects notably the completion of highway  north of prince george to the peace river block a section called the john hart highway and also public hospital insurance in  the reins of the coalition were taken over by byron ingemar johnson the conservatives had wanted their new leader herbert anscomb to be premier but the liberals in the coalition refused johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in british columbia history  in the  election this victory was attributable to the popularity of his governments spending programmes despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power during his tenure major infrastructures continued to expand such as the agreement with alcan aluminum to build the town of kitimat with an aluminum smelter and the large kemano hydro project johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the  flooding of the fraser valley which was a major blow to that region and to the provinces economy increasing tension between the liberal and conservative coalition partners led the liberal party executive to vote to instruct johnson to terminate the arrangement johnson ended the coalition and dropped his conservative cabinet ministers including deputy premier and finance minister herbert anscomb precipitating the general election of  a referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot similar to a preferential ballot where voters could select second and third choices the intent of the ballot as campaigned for by liberals and conservatives was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the ccf but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties including the ccf voted for the fringe british columbia social credit party socreds who wound up with the largest number of seats in the house  only one seat ahead of the ccf despite the ccf having  of the vote to social credits  the social credit party led by rebel former conservative mla w a c bennett formed a minority government backed by the liberals and conservatives with  and  seats respectively bennett began a series of fiscal reforms preaching a new variety of populism as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development laying the ground for a second election in  in which the new bennett regime secured a majority of seats with  of the vote secure with that majority bennett returned the province to the firstpastthepost system thereafter which is still in use today –sedit with the election of the social credit party british columbia embarked on a phase of rapid economic development bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry mining and energy sectors during these two decades the government nationalized british columbia electric and the british columbia power company as well as smaller electric companies renaming the entity bc hydro west kootenay power and light remained independent of bc hydro being owned and operated by cominco though tied into the regional power grid by the end of the s several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the peace columbia and nechako river watersheds the nechako diversion to kemano was to supply power to the alcan inc aluminum smelter at kitimat and was not part of the provincial power grid but privately owned major transmission deals were concluded most notably the columbia river treaty between canada and the united states the provinces economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector as well as oil and gas development in the provinces northeast the s and s were also marked by development in the provinces transportation infrastructure in  the government established bc ferries as a crown corporation to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system also supported by federal grants as being part of the transcanada highway system that system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges and paving of existing highways and provincial roads vancouver and victoria became cultural centres as poets authors artists musicians as well as dancers actors and haute cuisine chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures with the cultural and entrepreneurial community notably bolstered by many draft dodgers from the united states similarly these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics commentators and creative thinkerscitation needed tourism also began to play an important role in the economy the rise of japan and other pacific economies was a great boost to british columbias economy primarily because of massive exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees politically and socially the s brought a period of significant social ferment the divide between the political left and right which had prevailed in the province since the depression and the rise of the labour movement sharpened as socalled free enterprise parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by social credit—in opposition to the social democratic new democratic party the successor to the cooperative commonwealth federation as the provinces economy blossomed so did labourmanagement tensions tensions emerged also from the counterculture movement of the late s of which vancouver and nanaimo were centres the conflict between hippies and vancouver mayor tom campbell was particularly legendary culminating in the socalled gastown riots of  by the end of the decade with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the status quo rising the bennett governments achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity s and sedit on august   the social credit party was reelected in a general election for what would be bennetts final term in power at the start of the s the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector however bc hydro reported its first loss which was the beginning of the end for bennett and the social credit party the socreds were forced from power in the august  election paving the way for a provincial new democratic party ndp government under dave barrett under barrett the large provincial surplus soon became a deficitcitation needed although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous social credit regime and its two sets of books as wac bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management the brief threeyear thousand days period of ndp governance brought several lasting changes to the province most notably the creation of the agricultural land reserve intended to protect farmland from redevelopment and the insurance corporation of british columbia a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing singlepayer basic automobile insurance perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too farreaching coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the ndp in the  general election social credit under wac bennetts son bill bennett was returned to office under the younger bennetts government  of the provinces land base was transferred from government reserve to management by the ministry of forests reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the premiers office and ndpinstigated social programs were rolled back with thenhuman resources minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy although the newera socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the ndp—notably the creation of the resort municipality of whistler whose special status including sunday drinking then an anomaly in bc also during the miniwac regime a reference to his fathers acronym wac certain moneylosing crownowned assets were privatized in a mass giveaway of shares in the british columbia resources investment corporation bcric with the brick shares soon becoming nearworthless towards the end of his tenure in power bennett oversaw the completion of several megaprojects meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most rightwing parties british columbias social credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy most notable of these was the winning of a worlds fair for vancouver which came in the form of expo  to which was tied the construction of the coquihalla highway and vancouvers skytrain system the coquihalla highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premiers brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal the doman scandal in which the premier and millionaire backer herb doman were investigated for insidertrading and securities fraud nonetheless the socreds were reelected in  under bennett who led the party until  the coquihalla highway the road was one of the legacies of the expo  worlds fair the creation of the toll highway sparked controversy as the province entered a sustained recession bennetts popularity and media image were in decline on april   premier bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government and the lieutenantgovernor henry pybus bellirving was forced to call bennett to government house to resolve the impasse and an election was called for april  while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the executive council no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis campaigning on a platform of moderation bennett won an unexpected majority after several weeks of silence in the aftermath a sitting of the house was finally called and in the speech from the throne the socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed restraint which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign the programme included cuts to motherhood issues of the left including the human rights branch the offices of the ombudsman and rentalsman womens programs environmental and cultural programs while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate british columbia this sparked a backlash with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to  people this became known as the  solidarity crisis from the name of the solidarity coalition a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized consisting of organized labour and community groups with the british columbia federation of labour forming a separate organization of unions operation solidarity under the direction of jack munro thenpresident of the international woodworkers of america iwa the most powerful of the provinces resource unions tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a general strike would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the ndp and the left just as a strike at pacific press ended which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the provinces major papers the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and iwa president jack munro and premier bennett a tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued as among the new laws were those enabling nonunion labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues with companies from alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with unionscale british columbia companies despite the tension bennetts last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with expo and bennett was to end his career by hosting prince charles and lady diana on their visit to open expo  his retirement being announced a social credit convention was scheduled for the whistler resort which came down to a threeway shooting match between bud smith the premiers righthand man but an unelected official social credit party grande dame grace mccarthy and the charismatic but eccentric bill vander zalm bill vander zalm became the new socred leader when smith threw his support to him rather than see mccarthy win and led the party to victory in the election later that year vander zalm was later involved in a conflict of interest scandal following the sale of fantasy gardens a christian and dutch culture theme park built by the premier to tan yu a filipino chinese gambling kingpin there were also concerns over yus application to the government for a bank licence and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor faye leung of a party in the howard hughes suite on the top two floors of the bayshore inn where tan yu had been staying with reports of a bag of money in a brown paper bag passed from yu to vander zalm during the goingson these scandals forced vander zalms resignation and rita johnston became premier of the province johnston presided over the end of social credit power calling an election which led to the reducing of the partys caucus to only two seats and the revival of the longdefunct british columbia liberal party as opposition to the victorious ndp under

to struggle against the backdrop of a weak resource economy housing starts and an expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade despite political turmoil harcourt ended up resigning over bingogate—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings harcourt was not implicated but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside glen clark a former president of the bc federation of labour was chosen the new leader of the ndp which won a second term in  more scandals dogged the party most notably the fast ferry scandal involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in british columbia an allegation never substantiated that the premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to clarks resignation as premier he was succeeded on an interim basis by dan miller who was in turn followed by ujjal dosanjh following a leadership convention in the  general election gordon campbells bc liberals defeated the ndp gaining  out of  total seats in the provincial legislature campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the ndps policies including scrapping the fast ferries project lowering income taxes and the controversial sale of bc rail to cn rail campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for driving under the influence during a vacation in hawaii however campbell still managed to lead his party to victory in the  general election against a substantially strengthened ndp opposition campbell won a third term in the british columbia general election  marking the first time in  years that a premier has been elected to a third term the province won a bid to host the  winter olympics in vancouver and whistler as promised in his  reelection campaign vancouver mayor larry campbell staged a nonbinding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the olympics in february  vancouvers residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid sixtyfour percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games after the olympic joy had faded campbells popularity started to fall his management style the implementation of the harmonized sales tax hst against election promises and the cancelling of the bc rail corruption trial lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support he would resign in november  and call on the party to elect a new leader in early  christy clark former deputy premier would become leader of the liberal party though she was not currently a sitting mla she would go on to win the seat left vacant by campbell and form a government for the next two years she would attempt to distance herself from the unpopularity of campbell and forge an image for the upcoming election among her early accomplishments she raised the minimum wage created the new holiday of family day and pushed the development of bcs liquified natural gas in the  election the liberals lagged behind the ndp with a doubledigit gap in the polls but were able to come to a surprise victory on election night with a majority making clark the first elected female premier in bc history while clark lost her seat to ndp candidate david eby she later won a byelection in the riding of westsidekelowna her government would go on to balance the budget implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed enbridge northern gateway pipelines then in the  election the ndp would form a minority government with the support from the green party with just a slight edge over the liberal party  in the legislature then on july th the leader of the bc ndp john horgan would officially be sworn in as premier of british columbia with bc green party leader andrew weaver by his side british columbia has also been significantly affected by demographic changes within canada

democratic party in a minority supported by the british columbia green party led by premier john horgan who became premier as a result of a noconfidence motion on june   british columbia evolved from british possessions that were established in what is now british columbia by  first nations the original inhabitants of the land have a history of at least  years in the area today there are few treaties and the question of aboriginal title long ignored has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions notably the tsilhqotin nation has established aboriginal title to a portion of their territory as a result of the recent supreme court of canada decision william tsilhqotin nation v british columbia bcs economy is diverse with service producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the provinces gdp it is the endpoint of transcontinental railways and the site of major pacific ports that enable international trade though less than  of its vast  km  sq mi land is arable the province is agriculturally rich particularly in the fraser and okanagan valleys because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction principally logging farming and mining vancouver the provinces largest city and metropolitan area also serves as the headquarters of many westernbased natural resource companies it also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average while the coast of british columbia and certain valleys in the southcentral part of the province have mild weather the majority of its land mass experiences a coldwintertemperate

name was chosen by queen victoria when the colony of british columbia ie the mainland became a british colony in  it refers to the columbia district the british name for the territory drained by the columbia river in southeastern british columbia which was the namesake of the preoregon treaty columbia department of the hudsons bay company queen victoria chose british columbia to distinguish what was the british sector of the columbia district from that of the united states american columbia or southern columbia which became the oregon territory on august   as a result of the treaty ultimately the columbia in the name british columbia is derived from the name of the columbia rediviva an american ship which lent its name to the columbia river and later the wider region the columbia in the name columbia rediviva came from the name columbia for the new world or parts thereof a reference to christopher columbus geographyedit main article geography of british columbia british columbias geography is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief which has defined patterns of settlement and industry since colonization british columbia is bordered by the pacific ocean on the west side by the american state of alaska to the northwest and parts of the west on the north by yukon and the northwest territories on the east by the province of alberta and on the south by the states of washington idaho and montana the current southern border of british columbia was established by the  oregon treaty although its history is tied with lands as far south as california british columbias land area is  square kilometres  sq mi british columbias rugged coastline stretches for more than  kilometres  mi and includes deep mountainous fjords and about  islands most of which are uninhabited it is the only province in canada that borders the pacific ocean british columbias capital is victoria located at the southeastern tip of vancouver island only a narrow strip of the island from campbell river to victoria is significantly populated much of the western part of vancouver island and the rest of the coast is covered by thick tall and sometimes impenetrable temperate rainforest the provinces most populous city is vancouver which is located at the confluence of the fraser river and georgia strait in the southwest corner of the mainland an area often called the lower mainland by land area abbotsford is the largest city vanderhoof is near the geographic centre of the province the coast mountains and the inside passages many inlets provide some of british columbias renowned and spectacular scenery which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and ecotourism industry seventyfive percent of the province is mountainous more than  metres  ft above sea level  is forested and only about  is arable the provinces mainland away from the coastal regions is somewhat moderated by the pacific ocean terrain ranges from dry inland forests and semiarid in numerous valleys to the range and canyon districts of the central and southern interior to boreal forest and subarctic prairie in the northern interior the okanagan area extending from near vernon to osoyoos at the united states border is one of several wine and ciderproducing regions in canada other wine regions in british columbia include the cowichan valley on vancouver island and the fraser valley the southern interior cities of kamloops and penticton have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in canada although their temperatures can be exceeded north of the fraser canyon close to the confluence of the fraser and thompson rivers where the terrain is rugged and covered with deserttype flora semidesert grassland is found in large areas of the interior plateau with land uses ranging from ranching at lower altitudes to forestry at higher ones the northern mostly mountainous twothirds of the province are largely unpopulated and undeveloped except for the area east of the rockies where the peace river district in the northeast of the province contains bcs portion of the canadian prairies centred at dawson creek climateedit köppen climate types in british columbia strait of georgia near vancouver coastal southern british columbia has a mild rainy oceanic climate some far southern parts of which are warmsummer mediterranean influenced by the north pacific current which has its origins in the kuroshio current due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges the climate of the interior of the province is semiarid with certain locations receiving less than  mm  in annual precipitation the annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province is up to  °c  °f the mildest anywhere in canada the valleys of the southern interior have short winters with only brief bouts of cold or infrequent heavy snow while those in the cariboo in the central interior are colder because of increased altitude and latitude but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in canada for example the average daily low in prince george roughly located in the middle of the province in january is − °c  °f heavy snowfall occurs in all elevated mountainous terrain providing bases for skiers in both south and central british columbia winters are generally severe in the northern interior but even there milder air can penetrate far inland the coldest temperature in british columbia was recorded in smith river where it dropped to − °c − °f on january   one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in north america atlin in the provinces far northwest along with the adjoining southern lakes region of yukon get midwinter thaws caused by the chinook effect which is also common and much warmer in more southerly parts of the interior during winter on the coast rainfall sometimes relentless heavy rain dominates because of consistent barrages of cyclonic lowpressure systems from the north pacific average snowfall on the coast during an average winter is between  and  cm  and  in but on occasion and not every winter heavy snowfalls with more than  cm  in and well below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas typically for short periods and can take temperatures below − °c  °f even at sea level and arctic outflow winds can make wind chill temperatures at or even below − °c  °f for a couple of mornings while winters are very wet coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer under the influence of stable anticyclonic high pressure southern interior valleys are hot in summer for example in osoyoos the july maximum temperature averages  °c  °f the hottest month of any place in canada this hot weather sometimes spreads towards the coast or to the far north of the province temperatures often exceed  °c  °f in the lower elevations of valleys in the interior during midsummer with the record high of  °c  °f being held in lytton on july   the okanagan region has a climate suitable to vineyards the extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires from drylightning or manmade causes many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during the winter months in contrast to abundant summer sunshine annual sunshine hours vary from  near cranbrook and victoria to less than  in prince rupert located on the north coast just south of the alaska panhandle the exception to british columbias wet and cloudy winters is el niño during this

first nations groups and from early records from explorers encountering societies early in the period the arrival of paleoindians from beringia took place between  and  years ago hunter gatherer families were the main social structure from  to  years ago the nomadic population lived in nonpermanent structures foraging for nuts berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs around  years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary lifestyle these indigenous populations evolved over the next  years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs to the northwest of the

language group is believed to be linked to the yeniseian languages of siberia the dene of the western arctic may represent a distinct wave of migration from asia to north america the interior of british columbia was home to the salishan language groups such as the shuswap secwepemc okanagan and athabaskan language groups primarily the dakelh carrier and the tsilhqotin the inlets and valleys of the british columbia coast sheltered large distinctive populations such as the haida kwakwakawakw and nuuchahnulth sustained by the regions abundant salmon and shellfish these peoples developed complex cultures dependent on the western red cedar that included wooden houses seagoing whaling and war canoes and elaborately carved potlatch items and totem poles contact with europeans brought a series of devastating epidemics of diseases from europe that the people had no immunity to the result was a dramatic population collapse culminating in the  smallpox outbreak in victoria that spread throughout the coast european settlement did not bode well for the remaining native population of british columbia colonial officials deemed that colonists could make better use of the land than the

the bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the new caledonia district administered from fort st james the interior south of the thompson river watershed and north of the columbia was organized into the columbia district administered from fort vancouver on the lower columbia river the northeast corner of the province east of the rockies known as the peace river block was attached to the much larger athabasca district headquartered in fort chipewyan in presentday alberta until  these districts were a wholly unorganized area of british north america under the de facto jurisdiction of hbc administrators unlike ruperts land to the north and east however the territory was not a concession to the company rather it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the first nations inhabitants all that was changed with the westward extension of american exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty especially in the southern columbia basin within present day washington and oregon in  the oregon treaty divided the territory along the th parallel to the strait of georgia with the area south of this boundary excluding vancouver island and the gulf islands transferred to sole american sovereignty the colony of vancouver island was created in  with victoria designated as the capital new caledonia as the whole of the mainland rather than

main articles colony of british columbia – and richard clement moody with the fraser canyon gold rush in  an influx of americans into new caledonia prompted the colonial office to designate the mainland as the colony of british columbia when news of the fraser canyon gold rush reached london richard clement moody was handpicked by the colonial office under sir edward bulwerlytton to establish british order and to transform the newly established colony of british columbia into the british empires bulwark in the farthest west  and found a second england on the shores of the pacific lytton desired to send to the colony representatives of the best of british culture not just a police force he sought men who possessed courtesy high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world and he decided to send moody whom the government considered to be the english gentleman and british officer at the head of the royal engineers columbia detachment moody and his family arrived in british columbia in december  commanding the royal engineers columbia detachment he was sworn in as the first lieutenantgovernor of british columbia and appointed chief commissioner of lands and works for british columbia on the advice of lytton moody hired robert burnaby as his personal secretary in british columbia moody wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for british dominance styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe subsequent to the enactment of the preemption act of  moody settled the lower mainland he selected the site and founded the new capital new westminster he selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port he was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site writing in his letter to blackwood the entrance to the frazer is very strikingextending miles to the right  left are low marsh lands apparently of very rich qualities  yet fr the background of superb mountains swiss in outline dark in woods grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you everything is large and magnificent worthy of the entrance to the queen of england’s dominions on the pacific mainland  my imagination converted the silent marshes into cuyplike pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset  the water of the deep clear frazer was of a glassy stillness not a ripple before us except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away moody designed the first coat of arms of british columbia however lord lytton forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town and the efforts of moodys engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds which together with the continuous opposition of douglas made it impossible for moody’s design to be fulfilled moody and the royal engineers also built an extensive road network including what would become kingsway connecting new westminster to false creek the north road between port moody and new westminster and the cariboo road and stanley park he named burnaby lake after his private secretary robert burnaby and named port coquitlam’s foot mary hill after his wife as part of the surveying effort several tracts were designated government reserves which included stanley park as a military reserve a strategic location in case of an american invasion the preemption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land so large parcels were snapped up by speculators including  acres  hectares by moody himself for this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbingport moody is named after him it was established at the end of a trail that connected new westminster with burrard inlet to defend new westminster from potential attack from the us by  the cariboo gold rush attracting an additional  miners was underway and douglas hastened construction of the great north road commonly known now as the cariboo wagon road up the fraser canyon to the prospecting region around barkerville by the time of this gold rush the character of the colony was changing as a more stable population of british colonists settled in the region establishing businesses opening sawmills and engaging in fishing and agriculture with this increased stability objections to the colonys absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised led by the influential editor of the new westminster british columbian and future premier john robson a series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by douglas and the colonial office until douglas was eased out of office in  finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor later gold rushesedit a series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed the largest being the cariboo gold rush in  forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of farflung boom communities like barkerville and lillooet which sprang up overnight the vancouver island colony was facing financial crises of its own and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in  when the colony of british columbia was amalgamated with the colony of vancouver island to form the colony of british

of the canadian pacific railway at craigellachie november   completion of the transcontinental railroad was a condition of entry into confederation the confederation league including such figures as amor de cosmos john robson and robert beaven led the chorus pressing for the colony to join canada which had been created out of three british north american colonies in  the province of canada nova scotia and new brunswick several factors motivated this agitation including the fear of annexation to the united states the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth the need for governmentfunded services to support this population and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush memorial last spike in craigellachie with the agreement by the canadian government to extend the canadian pacific railway to british columbia and to assume the colonys debt british columbia became the sixth province to join confederation on july   the borders of the province were not completely settled the treaty of washington sent the pig war san juan islands border dispute to arbitration in  and in  the provinces territory shrank again after the alaska boundary dispute settled the vague boundary of the alaska panhandle population in british columbia continued to expand as the provinces mining forestry agriculture and fishing sectors were developed mining activity was particularly notable throughout the mainland particularly in the boundary country in the slocan in the west kootenay around trail the east kootenay the southeast corner of the province the fraser canyon the cariboo the omineca and the cassiar so much so a common epithet for the mainland even after provincehood was the gold colony agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile fraser valley and cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the thompson river area the cariboo the chilcotin and the okanagan forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast which was also the locus of a growing fishery the completion of the railway in  was a huge boost to the provinces economy facilitating the transportation of the regions considerable resources to the east the milltown of granville known as gastown near the mouth of the burrard inlet was selected as the terminus of the railway prompting the incorporation of the city as vancouver in  the completion of the port of vancouver spurred rapid growth and in less than fifty years the city surpassed winnipeg manitoba as the largest in western canada the early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically its settlement and development—were paramount this included expropriation from first nations people of their land control over its resources as well as the ability to trade in some resources such as the fishery establishing a labour force to develop the province was problematic from the start and british columbia was the locus of immigration from europe china and japan the influx of a noncaucasian population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups resulting in agitation much of it successful to restrict the ability of asian people to immigrate to british columbia through the imposition of a head tax this resentment culminated in mob attacks against chinese and japanese immigrants in vancouver in  and  by  almost all chinese immigration had been blocked except for merchants professionals students and investors meanwhile the province continued to grow in  the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line the grand trunk pacific linking northcentral british columbia from the yellowhead pass through prince george to prince rupert was driven at fort fraser this opened up the north coast and the bulkley valley region to new economic opportunities what had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus for forestry farming and mining in world war i the province responded strongly to the call to assist the british empire against its german foes in french and belgian battlefields about  of the  british columbian residents the highest percapita rate in canada responded to the military needs horseriders from the provinces interior region and first nations soldiers made contributions to vimy ridge and other battles about  men from the province died in combat s through sedit when the men returned from world war i they discovered the recently enfranchised women of the province had helped vote in the prohibition of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hardcore drinking that vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war because of pressure from veterans prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the soldier and the working man could enjoy a drink but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by european immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of soldier parties to represent their interests variously named soldierfarmer soldierlabour and farmerlabour parties these formed the basis of the fractured labourpolitical spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties including those who would eventually form the cooperative commonwealth and the early social credit splinter groups internment camp for the japanese canadians during world war ii the advent of prohibition in the united states created new opportunities and many found employment or at least profit in crossborder liquor smuggling much of vancouvers prosperity and opulence in the s results from this pirate economy although growth in forestry fishing and mining continued the end of us prohibition combined with the onset of the great depression plunged the province into economic destitution compounding the already dire local economic situation tens of thousands of men from colder parts of canada swarmed into vancouver creating huge hobo jungles around false creek and the burrard inlet rail yards including the old canadian pacific railway mainline rightofway through the heart of the citys downtown at hastings and carrall increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts an occupation of the main post office at granville and hastings which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of martial law on the docks for almost three years a vancouver contingent for the ontoottawa trek was organized and seized a train which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a gatling gun straddling the tracks at mission the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the depression there were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the s but it was the onset of world war ii which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the depression because of the war effort women entered the workforce as never before british columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the pacific ocean to have close relations with east asia however this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward asian immigrants this was most manifest during the second world war when many people of japanese descent were relocated or interned in the interior of the province coalition and the postwar boomedit the bc regiment dcor marching in new westminster  during world war ii the mainstream bc liberal and bc conservative parties of british columbia united in a formal coalition government under new liberal leader john hart who replaced duff pattullo when the latter failed to win a majority in the  election while the liberals won the most number of seats they actually received fewer votes than the socialist cooperative commonwealth federation ccf pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival conservatives led by royal maitland and was replaced by hart who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five liberal and three conservative ministers the ccf was invited to join the coalition but refused the pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of world war ii was to prevent the ccf which had won a surprise victory in saskatchewan in  from ever coming to power in british columbia the ccfs popular vote was high enough in the  election that they were likely to have won threeway contests and could have formed government however the coalition prevented that by uniting the antisocialist vote in the postwar environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects notably the completion of highway  north of prince george to the peace river block a section called the john hart highway and also public hospital insurance in  the reins of the coalition were taken over by byron ingemar johnson the conservatives had wanted their new leader herbert anscomb to be premier but the liberals in the coalition refused johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in british columbia history  in the  election this victory was attributable to the popularity of his governments spending programmes despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power during his tenure major infrastructures continued to expand such as the agreement with alcan aluminum to build the town of kitimat with an aluminum smelter and the large kemano hydro project johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the  flooding of the fraser valley which was a major blow to that region and to the provinces economy increasing tension between the liberal and conservative coalition partners led the liberal party executive to vote to instruct johnson to terminate the arrangement johnson ended the coalition and dropped his conservative cabinet ministers including deputy premier and finance minister herbert anscomb precipitating the general election of  a referendum on electoral reform prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot similar to a preferential ballot where voters could select second and third choices the intent of the ballot as campaigned for by liberals and conservatives was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the ccf but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties including the ccf voted for the fringe british columbia social credit party socreds who wound up with the largest number of seats in the house  only one seat ahead of the ccf despite the ccf having  of the vote to social credits  the social credit party led by rebel former conservative mla w a c bennett formed a minority government backed by the liberals and conservatives with  and  seats respectively bennett began a series of fiscal reforms preaching a new variety of populism as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development laying the ground for a second election in  in which the new bennett regime secured a majority of seats with  of the vote secure with that majority bennett returned the province to the firstpastthepost system thereafter which is still in use today –sedit with the election of the social credit party british columbia embarked on a phase of rapid economic development bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry mining and energy sectors during these two decades the government nationalized british columbia electric and the british columbia power company as well as smaller electric companies renaming the entity bc hydro west kootenay power and light remained independent of bc hydro being owned and operated by cominco though tied into the regional power grid by the end of the s several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the peace columbia and nechako river watersheds the nechako diversion to kemano was to supply power to the alcan inc aluminum smelter at kitimat and was not part of the provincial power grid but privately owned major transmission deals were concluded most notably the columbia river treaty between canada and the united states the provinces economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector as well as oil and gas development in the provinces northeast the s and s were also marked by development in the provinces transportation infrastructure in  the government established bc ferries as a crown corporation to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system also supported by federal grants as being part of the transcanada highway system that system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges and paving of existing highways and provincial roads vancouver and victoria became cultural centres as poets authors artists musicians as well as dancers actors and haute cuisine chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures with the cultural and entrepreneurial community notably bolstered by many draft dodgers from the united states similarly these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics commentators and creative thinkerscitation needed tourism also began to play an important role in the economy the rise of japan and other pacific economies was a great boost to british columbias economy primarily because of massive exports of lumber products and unprocessed coal and trees politically and socially the s brought a period of significant social ferment the divide between the political left and right which had prevailed in the province since the depression and the rise of the labour movement sharpened as socalled free enterprise parties coalesced into the de facto coalition represented by social credit—in opposition to the social democratic new democratic party the successor to the cooperative commonwealth federation as the provinces economy blossomed so did labourmanagement tensions tensions emerged also from the counterculture movement of the late s of which vancouver and nanaimo were centres the conflict between hippies and vancouver mayor tom campbell was particularly legendary culminating in the socalled gastown riots of  by the end of the decade with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the status quo rising the bennett governments achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity s and sedit on august   the social credit party was reelected in a general election for what would be bennetts final term in power at the start of the s the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector however bc hydro reported its first loss which was the beginning of the end for bennett and the social credit party the socreds were forced from power in the august  election paving the way for a provincial new democratic party ndp government under dave barrett under barrett the large provincial surplus soon became a deficitcitation needed although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous social credit regime and its two sets of books as wac bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management the brief threeyear thousand days period of ndp governance brought several lasting changes to the province most notably the creation of the agricultural land reserve intended to protect farmland from redevelopment and the insurance corporation of british columbia a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing singlepayer basic automobile insurance perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too farreaching coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the ndp in the  general election social credit under wac bennetts son bill bennett was returned to office under the younger bennetts government  of the provinces land base was transferred from government reserve to management by the ministry of forests reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the premiers office and ndpinstigated social programs were rolled back with thenhuman resources minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy although the newera socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the ndp—notably the creation of the resort municipality of whistler whose special status including sunday drinking then an anomaly in bc also during the miniwac regime a reference to his fathers acronym wac certain moneylosing crownowned assets were privatized in a mass giveaway of shares in the british columbia resources investment corporation bcric with the brick shares soon becoming nearworthless towards the end of his tenure in power bennett oversaw the completion of several megaprojects meant to stimulate the economy and win votes – unlike most rightwing parties british columbias social credit actively practised government stimulation of the economy most notable of these was the winning of a worlds fair for vancouver which came in the form of expo  to which was tied the construction of the coquihalla highway and vancouvers skytrain system the coquihalla highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premiers brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal the doman scandal in which the premier and millionaire backer herb doman were investigated for insidertrading and securities fraud nonetheless the socreds were reelected in  under bennett who led the party until  the coquihalla highway the road was one of the legacies of the expo  worlds fair the creation of the toll highway sparked controversy as the province entered a sustained recession bennetts popularity and media image were in decline on april   premier bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government and the lieutenantgovernor henry pybus bellirving was forced to call bennett to government house to resolve the impasse and an election was called for april  while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the executive council no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis campaigning on a platform of moderation bennett won an unexpected majority after several weeks of silence in the aftermath a sitting of the house was finally called and in the speech from the throne the socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed restraint which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign the programme included cuts to motherhood issues of the left including the human rights branch the offices of the ombudsman and rentalsman womens programs environmental and cultural programs while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate british columbia this sparked a backlash with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to  people this became known as the  solidarity crisis from the name of the solidarity coalition a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized consisting of organized labour and community groups with the british columbia federation of labour forming a separate organization of unions operation solidarity under the direction of jack munro thenpresident of the international woodworkers of america iwa the most powerful of the provinces resource unions tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a general strike would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the ndp and the left just as a strike at pacific press ended which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the provinces major papers the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and iwa president jack munro and premier bennett a tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued as among the new laws were those enabling nonunion labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues with companies from alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with unionscale british columbia companies despite the tension bennetts last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with expo and bennett was to end his career by hosting prince charles and lady diana on their visit to open expo  his retirement being announced a social credit convention was scheduled for the whistler resort which came down to a threeway shooting match between bud smith the premiers righthand man but an unelected official social credit party grande dame grace mccarthy and the charismatic but eccentric bill vander zalm bill vander zalm became the new socred leader when smith threw his support to him rather than see mccarthy win and led the party to victory in the election later that year vander zalm was later involved in a conflict of interest scandal following the sale of fantasy gardens a christian and dutch culture theme park built by the premier to tan yu a filipino chinese gambling kingpin there were also concerns over yus application to the government for a bank licence and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor faye leung of a party in the howard hughes suite on the top two floors of the bayshore inn where tan yu had been staying with reports of a bag of money in a brown paper bag passed from yu to vander zalm during the goingson these scandals forced vander zalms resignation and rita johnston became premier of the province johnston presided over the end of social credit power calling an election which led to the reducing of the partys caucus to only two seats and the revival of the longdefunct british columbia liberal party as opposition to the victorious ndp under

this article needs to be updated please update this section to reflect recent events or newly available information august  johnston lost the  general election to the ndp under the leadership of mike

to struggle against the backdrop of a weak resource economy housing starts and an expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade despite political turmoil harcourt ended up resigning over bingogate—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings harcourt was not implicated but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside glen clark a former president of the bc federation of labour was chosen the new leader of the ndp which won a second term in  more scandals dogged the party most notably the fast ferry scandal involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in british columbia an allegation never substantiated that the premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to clarks resignation as premier he was succeeded on an interim basis by dan miller who was in turn followed by ujjal dosanjh following a leadership convention in the  general election gordon campbells bc liberals defeated the ndp gaining  out of  total seats in the provincial legislature campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the ndps policies including scrapping the fast ferries project lowering income taxes and the controversial sale of bc rail to cn rail campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for driving under the influence during a vacation in hawaii however campbell still managed to lead his party to victory in the  general election against a substantially strengthened ndp opposition campbell won a third term in the british columbia general election  marking the first time in  years that a premier has been elected to a third term the province won a bid to host the  winter olympics in vancouver and whistler as promised in his  reelection campaign vancouver mayor larry campbell staged a nonbinding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the olympics in february  vancouvers residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid sixtyfour percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games after the olympic joy had faded campbells popularity started to fall his management style the implementation of the harmonized sales tax hst against election promises and the cancelling of the bc rail corruption trial lead to low approval ratings and loss of caucus support he would resign in november  and call on the party to elect a new leader in early  christy clark former deputy premier would become leader of the liberal party though she was not currently a sitting mla she would go on to win the seat left vacant by campbell and form a government for the next two years she would attempt to distance herself from the unpopularity of campbell and forge an image for the upcoming election among her early accomplishments she raised the minimum wage created the new holiday of family day and pushed the development of bcs liquified natural gas in the  election the liberals lagged behind the ndp with a doubledigit gap in the polls but were able to come to a surprise victory on election night with a majority making clark the first elected female premier in bc history while clark lost her seat to ndp candidate david eby she later won a byelection in the riding of westsidekelowna her government would go on to balance the budget implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed enbridge northern gateway pipelines then in the  election the ndp would form a minority government with the support from the green party with just a slight edge over the liberal party  in the legislature then on july th the leader of the bc ndp john horgan would officially be sworn in as premier of british columbia with bc green party leader andrew weaver by his side british columbia has also been significantly affected by demographic changes within canada and around the world vancouver and to a lesser extent some other parts of british columbia was a major destination for many of the immigrants from hong kong who left the former uk colony either temporarily or permanently in the years immediately prior to its handover to the peoples republic of china british columbia has also been a significant destination for internal canadian migrants this has been the case throughout recent decades because of its image of natural beauty mild climate and relaxed lifestyle but is particularly true during periods of economic growth as a result british

to  western canadian average the largest section of this employment is in finance insurance real estate and corporate management many areas outside of metropolitan areas however are still heavily reliant on resource extraction with its film industry known as hollywood north the vancouver region is the thirdlargest feature film production location in north america after los angeles and new york city the economic history of british columbia is replete with tales of dramatic upswings and downswings and this boom and bust pattern has influenced the politics culture and business climate of the

british columbia during the absence of the lieutenantgovernor the governor general in council may appoint an administrator to execute the duties of the office in practice this is usually the chief justice of british columbia british columbia has an member elected legislative assembly elected by the plurality voting system though in recent years there has been significant debate about switching to a single transferable vote system the government of the day appoints ministers for various portfolios what are officially part of the executive council of british columbia cabinet of whom the premier is chair the province is currently governed by the british columbia new democratic party bc ndp under premierdesignate john horgan the  provincial election saw the liberal party take  seats the ndp take  and the british columbia green party take  no party met the minimum of  seats for a majority therefore leading to the first minority government since  following the election the greens entered into negotiations with both the liberals and ndp eventually announcing that they would support the current ndp minority previously the rightofcentre british columbia liberal party governed the province for sixteen years between  and  and won the largest landslide election in british columbia history in  with  of  seats the legislature became more evenly divided however between the liberals and ndp following the   liberal seats of  and   liberal seats of  provincial elections the ndp and its predecessor the ccf have been the main opposition force to rightwing parties since the s and have ruled with majority governments in – and – the green party plays a larger role in the politics of british columbia than green parties do in most other jurisdictions in canada after a breakthrough election in   the partys vote share declined  –   –     before increasing again to a record high of  at the  election the british columbia liberal party is not related to the federal liberal party and does not share the same ideology instead the bc liberal party is a rather diverse coalition made up of the remnants of the social credit party many federal liberals federal conservatives and those who would otherwise support rightofcentre or free enterprise parties historically there have commonly been third parties present in the legislature including the liberals themselves from  to  the bc green party are the current third party in british columbia with three seats in the legislature prior to the rise of the liberal party british columbias main political party was the british columbia social credit party which ruled british columbia for  continuous years while sharing some ideology with the current liberal government they were more rightwing although undertook nationalization of various important monopolies notably bc hydro and bc ferries the meeting chamber of the provincial legislative assembly british columbia is known for having politically active labour unions who have traditionally supported the ndp or its predecessor the ccf british columbias political history is typified by scandal and a cast of colourful characters beginning with various colonialera land scandals and abuses of power by early officials such as those that led to mcgowans war in – notable scandals in social credit years included the robert bonner affair and the fantasy gardens scandal which forced premier bill vander zalm to resign and ended the social credit era ndp scandals included bingogate which brought down ndp premier mike harcourt and the alleged scandal named casinogate which drove ndp premier glen clark to resign a variety of scandals plagued the  liberal government including premier gordon campbells arrest for drunk driving in maui and the resignation of various cabinet ministers because of conflictofinterest allegations a christmas evewhich raid on the parliament buildings in victoria including the premiers office has resulted in charges only for ministerial aides although key cabinet members from the time have since resigned the case currently in preliminary hearings in the courts and relating to the sale of bc rail to cn rail may not reach trial because of the mass of evidence and various procedural problemscitation needed campbell eventually resigned in late  due to opposition to his governments plan to introduce a harmonized sales tax hst and was replaced by christy clark as premier in a  bc liberal leadership election british columbia is underrepresented in the senate of canada leading premier christy clark to refuse to cooperate with the federal governments new reforms for senate appointments to be made based on the recommendations of a new advisory board that would use nonpartisan criteria hours after that plan was unveiled in ottawa on december   clark issued a statement that it did not address what’s been wrong with the senate since the beginning the imbalance in representation in that house is apparent when considering population size the six senators from bc constitute only one for every  people vs one for every  in pei which has four senators nova scotia and new brunswick have much smaller populations than bc yet each has ten senators according to a global news summary correcting this imbalance would require a constitutional amendment but that is unlikely to be supported by the atlantic provinces official

transportationedit transportation played a huge role in british columbias history the rocky mountains and the ranges west of them constituted a significant obstacle to overland travel until the completion of the transcontinental railway in  the peace river canyon through the rocky mountains was the route that the earliest explorers and fur traders used fur trade routes were only marginally used for access to british columbia through the mountains travel from the rest of canada before  meant the difficulty of overland travel via the united states around cape horn or overseas from asia nearly all travel and freight to and from the region occurred via the pacific ocean primarily through the ports of victoria and new westminster until the s rail was the only means of overland travel to and from the rest of canada travellers using motor vehicles needed to journey through the united states with the construction of the interprovincial highway in  now known as the crowsnest pass

to connect its communities british columbias roads systems were notoriously poorly maintained and dangerous until a concentrated programme of improvement was initiated in the s and s there are now freeways in greater victoria the lower mainland and central interior of the province much of the rest of the province where traffic volumes are generally low is accessible by wellmaintained generally highmobility twolane arterial highways with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas and usually only a few stopcontrolled intersections outside the main urban areas a couple of busy intercity corridors outside greater vancouver feature more heavily signalized limitedmobility arterial highways that are mostly fourlane and often divided by portable median traffic barriers highway  on vancouver island and highway  through the okanagan valley are medium to highvolume roadways with variable posted speeds that range from  kmh to maximums just slightly lower than the principal gradeseparated highways numerous traffic lights operate in place of interchanges on both arterials as longterm costcutting measures signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along interurban sections where traffic volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of highmobility alternative routes or bypasses the building and maintenance of provincial highways is the responsibility of the british columbia ministry of transportation and infrastructure there are only five major routes to the rest of canada from south to north they are bc highway  through the crowsnest pass the vermilion pass highway  in both british columbia and alberta the kicking horse pass the latter being used by the transcanada highway entering alberta through banff national park the yellowhead highway  through jasper national park and highway  through dawson creek there are also

surface transportation until the expansion and improvement of the provincial highways system began in the s two major routes through the yellowhead pass competed with the canadian pacific railway—the grand trunk pacific terminating at prince rupert and the canadian northern railway terminating at vancouver the pacific great eastern line supplemented this service providing a north–south route

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
