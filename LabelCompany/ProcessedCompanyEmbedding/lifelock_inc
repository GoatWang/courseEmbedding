score instead there are many companies that apply many models—all based on your credit report data each takes a slightly different approach to calculating a score lifelock uses the vantagescore  ® model which uses the same  to  range as the most familiar scoring model fico but may produce a slightly different number the credit score is intended for your own educational use it is also commercially available to third parties along with numerous other credit scores and models in the marketplace please keep in mind third parties are likely to use a different score when evaluating your creditworthiness also third parties will take into consideration items other than your credit score or information found in your credit file such as your income whos who in credit there are a variety of organizations involved in helping to assess your likelihood of paying back money you’ve borrowed to better understand credit you need to begin by understanding the various organizations and processes involved in determining whether to offer you credit and at what terms here are the terms to know what are lenders lenders determine your creditworthiness by evaluating the information on your credit profile they also regularly contribute information about your loans—the amount borrowed whether you’ve made timely payments and so on—to the three national credit bureaus equifax experian and transunion what are credit bureaus the credit bureaus collect information from lenders and other data sources create a comprehensive credit report and provide this data to potential lenders and others that might need to assess your creditworthiness such as landlords what are credit reports credit reports also known as credit files are composed of the data a credit bureau has gathered about you from lenders and other sources credit reports include records of mortgage payments credit card balances and payments auto loan payments and credit inquiries it may also include public records such as tax liens and other information from government sources what is a credit scoring model credit scoring models are developed to provide a numerical interpretation of the information in your credit report that has been tested to be predictive this gives lenders a statistical measurement of how likely you are to pay back a loan some people are surprised to learn that there is no universal credit score instead there are many companies that apply many models—all based on your credit report data lifelock uses a scoring model called vantagescore  ® which uses the familiar  range its entirely healthy and routine for your credit scores to change slightly but generally a good idea to keep track of your score so you can notice any dramatic shifts many people confuse credit reports with credit scores but the two are quite different understanding that difference can help you to figure out why you have a particular score the credit score is intended for your own educational use it is also commercially available to third parties along with numerous other credit scores and models in the marketplace please keep in mind third parties are likely to use a different score when evaluating your creditworthiness also third parties will take into consideration items other than your credit score or information found in your credit file such as your income how is credit scored a credit score is a threedigit number that results from a mathematical formula being applied to your credit report credit scores may differ from one source to the next because different lenders use different credit scoring models and since a score is based on frequently updated credit files it may vary over time its entirely healthy and routine for your credit scores to change slightly but generally a good idea to keep track of your score so you can notice any dramatic changes the credit score is intended for your own educational use it is also commercially available to third parties along with numerous other credit scores and models in the marketplace please keep in mind third parties are likely to use a different score when evaluating your creditworthiness also third parties will take into consideration items other than your credit score or information found in your credit file such as your income why are there differences between my scores from each bureau because your scores are calculated using the information in your credit files which may differ across the three bureaus there may be differences between the scores each bureau provides thats why its important to periodically review your reports and scores from all three agencies the credit score is intended for your own educational use it is also commercially available to third parties along with numerous other credit scores and models in the marketplace please keep in mind third parties are likely to use a different score when evaluating your creditworthiness also third parties will take into consideration items

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
