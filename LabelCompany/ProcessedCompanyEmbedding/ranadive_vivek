leadershipleadership style sharebar in a few years there will be no such thing as an ebusiness says vivek yranadivé mba  as founder chairman and ceo of palo altobased tibco software inc wwwtibcocom it would seem that ranadivé is predicting the demise of his own company among other functions tibcos software provides the infrastructure ormiddleware that makes ecommerce work across disparate computer systems his meaning however is just the opposite the concept of ebusiness will disappear because every business will be an ebusiness ranadivé explains physical stores wont go away theyll be knitted into the fabric of how people buy and sell goods and services skeptics might disagree with such a sweeping declaration but they would be hardpressed to disregard tibco softwares growth since its founding in  total revenues for fiscal  were  million an  percent increase over the previous year the company which employs about one thousand workers worldwide went public in july  an article that appeared last february in red herrings online edition wwwredherringcom noted that tibcos stock had risen  percent from its initial public offering price with a  billion market cap and a  million revenue run rate per year tibco is one of the fastestgrowing software companies ever like any corporate executive ranadivé is concerned with the dollarsandcents valuation of his company and how that affects future growth but he drops the word dream in conversation more frequently than market cap stock options or ipo a native of bombay india ranadivé says he feels both international and american you can have big dreams here he remarks the united states is a very multicultural and open country when dealing with technology open systems that can be leveraged by anyone will thrive over closed proprietary systems i think of the united states as an open system in that sense one of ranadivés earliest dreams was to study at mit which he learned of through a documentary film on the institution despite the economic and emotional difficulty of attending the faraway university ranadivé persevered and in  he arrived in cambridge with fifty dollars in his pocket he credits his parents for their support of his plans my family comes from a tradition of education and public service he says noting that his grandmother was the first female judge in india and that his father who now lives in california is involved in charitable projects in india and the united states in four years ranadivé completed a bachelors degree in electrical engineering and a masters in mechanical engineering after a brief stint at ford motor company and with the network equipment provider linkabit he decided to enroll at hbs i wanted to get the best education and i felt that harvard was the best business school ranadivé states citing the case method and the quality of the hbs faculty as among the schools strongest attributes in some ways the case method explains why survivor was such a popular television show he laughs you throw a bunch of people into one classroom and see who shines i wanted to learn more about people and human interactions so hbs was an extremely valuable experience for me not long after leaving soldiers field ranadivé had an idea that would transform the computer industry my background was as a hardware engineer he says if you look inside a computer theres a back plane or bus with cards that plug in to run the machines functions my idea was to create a software bus and plug applications into that as simple as it sounds this insight had a dramatic impact on the financial services institutions that were among ranadivés first customers tibco is an acronym for the information bus companyin  investment banks were researching new systems for streamlining the flow of data when ranadivé arrived at goldman sachs his first potential client he was astounded by the complicated assortment of monitors cable and wire surrounding each trader  the mix even included strategically placed electric fans to cool overheated equipment former secretary of the treasury robert rubin then head of goldman sachs equities trading department hired ranadivés newly formed teknekron software systems to consolidate this hodgepodge of data traffic to work within a single desktop computer his software did just that and before long teknekron dominated the business of automating trading floors in  ranadivé sold the company to reuters group plc for  million it now employs some twelve hundred workers and operates separately as tibco finance technology inc rather than retire at the ripe old age of  ranadivé developed his software bus for other industries under the umbrella of tibco software in many ways the trading floor of the s was a microcosm of ebusiness today he observes starting a company to automate the financial industry was the greatest training possible for the internet revolution tibco now provides software to a range of industries that includes hightech manufacturing telecommunications energy retail ebusiness and the internet motorola intel enron cisco systems procter  gamble delta air lines and yahoo are just a few of tibcos customers diverse as these companies may be tibcos product performs the same essential function for all of them delivering information across networks in real time ranadivé shares his expertise in his  book the power of now in which he explores the impact on business of what is often referred to as eventdriven software or push technology beyond the wideranging influence tibco already enjoys ranadivé envisions a metanetwork of the future therell be ubiquitous computing he predicts with billions of sensors and microprocessors for example your lawn will determine that its dry and sprinklers will automatically water it the more immediate task at hand however is keeping tibco on top one of the biggest challenges is to make sure we continue to hire really good employees says ranadivé we have lots of millionaires around here  plenty of people who dont have to come to work every day i need to have dreams that are big enough to keep them interested another concern is staying nimble he continues someone in a garage right now is inventing a product that could be threatening to me its important to stay paranoid and avoid complacency which isnt to say ranadivé doesnt find time to play tennis or bicycle with his two sons ages  and  and his yearold daughter he also serves on the board of san franciscos jewish museum i view judaism as being the source code for western civilization ranadivé remarks hindu by birth he prefers to envision a world in which shared values take precedence over individual religions a strong belief in the advantages of open accepting systems  whether technological or theological  underlies much of ranadivés philosophy particularly when he considers tibco and his function at the company my role is to let people do their own thing and make sure that what comes out is music its more like leading a jazz group than a marching band thats the job of a leader sharebar featured alumni featured alumni vivek ranadive class of mba  section b follow

sacramento kings new direction with technology vivek ranadive gives sacramento kings new direction with technology nba technology february  february   adam xu  it has been a decade since the sacramento kings have made headlines in the western conference playoffs until recently it’s as if this nba franchise had been forgotten in  the kings were one of the most exciting teams in the nba the franchise electrified fans everywhere and they were contenders in the playoffs for several years  vivek ranadive is determined to return the kings back to that throne unlike most franchise owners vivek ranadive’s passion for the sport came at a very late age a single father to three children he volunteered to coach a middle school girls basketball team in hopes of spending more time with his daughter anjali having no prior experience or even touching a basketball ranadive managed to lead that team to the national championship in malcolm gladwell’s new best seller david and goliath the acclaimed author featured vivek ranadive’s coaching experience in his opening chapter undersized and under skilled ranadive’s approach to the game was to full court press all the teams all the time in order for david to beat goliath he had to choose an unconventional strategy one where the underdog could level out the playing field ranadive embodies this principle both on the court and in how he conducts his business in the summer of   year old vivek ranadive had his ears glued to the radio during the moon landing for ranadive that one small step for man inspired him to come to america after leaving mumbai india at age  his underdog story would begin at the prestigious mit where he obtained his bachelors and masters degree both within four years at age  he obtained his mba from harvard as a baker scholar as a young entrepreneur ranadive pursued his first business venture while still at mit which would later become unix consulting services since then ranadive’s vision has led him to establish benchmark technology companies such as teknekron software systems and tibco today the  year old ceo and founder of tibco software resides in an estate in silicon valley his technology company specializes in infrastructure and business intelligence software as of last year tibco was capitalized at  billion dollars ranadive’s story however extends beyond silicon valley and even the sports industry itself  it is a story of the america dream a father and his daughter and how david was able to beat goliath as a former minority owner of the golden state warriors ranadive had implemented significant developments to their social media network after acquiring the kings franchise in may  ranadive has already made momentous changes to the franchise’s culture and future direction ranadive had tibco develop a sacramento kings app specifically for their fans the app allows fans to earn points through digital interaction allowing them to redeem kings tickets and merchandise the king’s app includes mobile ticketing functions and other all access information the app also allows location based offers and provides other functions that enhance the overall fan experience the network incorporates high speed messaging real time event processing engines and various visual capturing devices ranadive’s vision is to expand the kings globally the app aims to have fans across the world have the same experience as those sitting in the arena with the new culture of technology the kings introduced the google glass broadcast on january th against the indiana pacers the franchise partnered with crowdoptic to provide a unique perspective to the game select players staff mascots dancers and announcers provided visual feed that would allow fans to have a first person experience the kings have also announced that by march st  fans will be able to purchase tickets and merchandise through bitcoins in doing so the team would become the first professional sports franchise to accept the virtual currency following a threat of relocation the team is now seeing an increase in ticket sales and a positive outlook from the fan response the franchise is also expecting to move to a  million dollar arena in  the nba has always maximized social networking to engage their fans considering that one of the nba’s main areas of development is to expand their product globally ranadive’s technological approach could serve as a precedent to the league’s future direction although the kings are still in the bottom rankings of the western conference the franchise has found momentum towards a new direction as the new owner of the sacramento kings vivek ranadive is once again the underdog for david the goliath he now faces has become faster stronger

vivek ranadivé tech entrepreneur to help uc fund innovations    back to gallery university of california researchers are so prolific — inventing ways to use mushrooms for powering cell phone batteries or to breed seeds tailored for organic farming for example — that they have outpaced the amount of capital available for turning their creativity into products for sale so the university announced tuesday it has enlisted a celebrity entrepreneur from silicon valley vivek ranadivé to head a new investment fund so that researchers can access the cash they need to bring their ideas to market — and return the profits to uc latest news videos ranadivé  brought wall street into the digital world in the s has founded software companies and owns the sacramento kings basketball team he’s also a former coowner of the golden state warriors uc will seed the asyetunnamed fund with  million while ranadivé said he will contribute  percent of the fund “we have the ability to influence the california economy and address the world’s great problems” uc president janet napolitano said of the brain power across the university’s  campuses “what we have not had consistently is the ability to accelerate into the marketplace the ideas in our labs by our students and faculty they’ve had to go out on their own to find capital and i’d venture to say some have not succeeded” the new fund will create a “ready pipeline” for inventors in such fields as medicine agriculture energy and technology napolitano said it is also expected that profits from uc companies will create a pipeline of additional revenue for the monstersize pension system that uc has struggled to fully fund and for other uc needs uc researchers already invent an average of five new products a day and have started about  companies selling everything from braintraining apps to otoscopes that clip onto a phone and let parents send a picture of a sick child’s inner ear to their doctor “uc is the feeding ground for a lot of startups even today” said ranadivé who has two children who are uc graduates but uc researchers won’t be the only beneficiaries of the fund which will “seek compelling opportunities outside of uc by leveraging my vast network” ranadivé said “our mission is to help grow companies that will help advance society and make the world a better place” nanette asimov is a san francisco chronicle

drucker of the st century while mr drucker and later tom peters’ management principles helped reform the global business landscape mr ranadive is preaching a new technology mantra – realtime computing – that promises to revolutionize the way global giants conduct commerce while management principles are nice in theory mr ranadive is proposing a new technology – event driven computing mr ranadive who happens to be founder and chief executive of tibco software a palo altobased  billion in market capitalization and  million in  sales company that he has written a book on the topic the power of now advertisement the power of now explains how companies use realtime information to anticipate and instantly respond to the everchanging tide of new opportunities and new business strategies mr ranadiv provides a model in which corporations develop and deliver superior goods and services for their customers through a continual dialog with them and all of this happens as quickly as possible thanks to realtime technology for the internet and the enterprise he sees a world which imitates the nasdaq stock exchange  like the traders responding to the events like demand for certain shares or stock’s movement to news related to a particular company say for example juniper networks he believes that companies should be responding to the changing ¶chaos of business¾ today in such a manner as well new information about bloated inventories should result in realtime discounts on products or special offers to customers mr ranadive describes this as zerolag ¶cashtocash¾ business where the time delay between cash spent on producing goods and the cash received from customers is nearly zero oh he can talk about this for hours and sitting in the trendy new bistro tamarind in the soign gramercy park area in new york the ideas pour from mr ranadive like champagne flowing out of a bottle of moet after it has been shaken stirred and uncorked literally talking at ¶mileaminute¾ mr ranadive proposes a whole new efficient world empowered by new technologies of course like all true chief executives he talks about the magnificent opportunity it offers for his company ¾we could be a company which supports a billion ecosystem¾ he boasts betting that large corporations in industries as diverse as technology financial services and healthcare would but tibco’s ¶middleware¾ software which makes corporation ¶realtime¾ i first met mr ranadive when researching for my cover story on real time computing which was eventually published in the july  issue of red herring go to generation now gets up to speed it has been a year since we talked about improving efficiencies in the corporation and every single time we have met he points out how close we are towards a more realtime corporation the key to his “real time” vision is tibco’s software which the pundits and technology guru’s describe as “new middleware” this software is like the glue which ties together all old legacy applications like sap siebel or great plains and gives it a webmakeover and adds eventbased rules which help a company better utilize all the information that flows in from its sales channel employees and partners thanks for this software mr ranadive has a captive audience of his own  his company’s software helps manage transactions equaling trillions of dollars and counts more than  of the world’s largest banks and financial institutions as its customers ¶oh my only competition in this market is ibm¾ he says born in mumbai  summers ago mr ranadive came to the us to pursue a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at mit and later went to harvard business school to pursue his mba but it was not up until he started tibco that his vision of a realtime world started becoming a reality one thing about mr ranadive is that he is relentless  he has been preaching this mantra for almost two decades and now his vision is beginning to find a receptive audience in the technology universe many venture capitalists have come to a similar conclusion and have beginning to shovel money into startups that are building software and related products that bring the world closer to a “real time enterprise” many startups have come forward with their own versions of a real time enterprise including knownow which has been funded by kleiner perkins caufield  byers and counts rohit khare a big shot in the web world not worried about any competition mr ranadive is now busy talking about a world where the refrigerator order milk when the supply runs low and the devices decide where to buy electricity in realtime so that you do not have pay huge electricity bills sounds far fetched doesn’t it well i was excused from pointing that out for mr ranadive expresses an almost childlike delight at ¶bhelpuri¾ which arrived on our table and of course since tamarind is a fashionable place this was the best bhelpuri both of us had ever seen  and got busy eatinggeneration now gets upto speed advertisement advertisement comments are closed vivek ranadive – hoopball all posts tagged vivek ranadivereport kings owner vivek ranadive attended otto porter pitch meetingkings majority owner vivek ranadive attended the pitch meeting for restricted free agent otto porter on sunday according to beat writer ben standigthis will likely make the locals in sacramento cringe as his involvement in basketball decisions has been a major issue in the past and gauging his involvement in future decisions is always on everybody’s minds in sacto can also confirm kings owner vivek ranadivé attended the porter pitch meeting per source httpstcokexwauvm— ben standig benstandig july   vivek told buddy hield ‘we’re still going to get you’ in prior visits to sacramentobuddy hield had his first media appearance after practice on wednesday in sacramento and he relayed a story about how kings owner vivek ranadive approached him while he was a member of the pelicansvideo can be found here from news  in sacramento“vivek always — when i came in here the past two times he always talked about ‘we always be pushing hard for you and but we’re still gonna get you’  i was surprised about him saying that but now when i saw i was going to sacramento and i say oh these guys are really serious about me”setting aside the issue of whether or not an owner should be approaching another team’s player like that — as well as the potential for hield to be relaying the story in a way that doesn’t accurately capture the friendly banter — it’s not going to do anything for the perception that vivek is still making basketball decisionsour sources have indicated that vivek indeed did have influence over the basketball decision and other reports have echoed thatit’s the decisionmaking process in sacramento that has come under the most scrutiny over the past few days and it will continue to do so until the product on the court improves significantlyand until basketball people are the only ones in sacramento handling the decisions that’s not likely going to be the case geoff petrie comments on vivek ranadiveearlier this week sam amick of usa today posted a two part interview with sacramento kings owner vivek ranadive in which he spoke about his first few years with the kings talking about the challenges that he faced and attempting to explain some of the decisions that have been questioned during his tenure for reference here are the links to part one and part two of that interviewdoing the interview and speaking about past mistakes was not necessarily a bad idea  it should be noted that being the owner of an nba franchise is not easy and for that reason some mistakes are expectedwith the team committing to vlade divac and dave joerger the goal should be to convince fans that the team is heading toward stability  much has been made of sacramento’s inability to stick to a direction whether that be with the front office or the coaching staff so coming out and recognizing where they’ve gone wrong while also mentioning the steps that have been taken to improve could have been a good move for the organizationunfortunately this isn’t the direction that ranadive took during the interview  he assessed blame and very rarely took responsibility for his role in the dysfunction  considering the number of people that were involved in the situations discussed in the interview it wasn’t surprising that somebody spoke up to respond to his commentsgeoff petrie was the first to respond to some of the claims  petrie was the general manger of the team during the sale and was involved for a short period of time after randive took over  during his interview with amick ranadive had this to say about that time period“look you’ve got to hire the gm and then the coach but i also went to some – and i don’t want to name them – but i went to some very smart people for advice and they said ‘hey malone is great we like malone’ sam that practice facility was empty i had the draft was going to start and players were going to come in for tryouts there was nobody there i needed somebody to go and actually work out the players nobody wanted to there incumbent general manager geoff petrie didn’t want to be there the coach keith smart didn’t want to be there there was nobody there”he certainly didn’t hold back with his comments  ranadive was criticized heavily for hiring michael malone before hiring a general manager and this quote was an attempt to explain that decision  in ranadive’s version of the story the team needed help leading up to the draft which fueled the malone hiring  this makes sense if the current front office wasn’t willing to be involved in the processthis part of the interview clearly angered petrie  in a separate interview with kevin draper of deadspin geoff petrie spoke about his time with the team after the sale petrie began by saying that ranadive wasn’t exactly honest in his retelling“the main reason i reached out the interview is long and covered a lot of territory but when it comes to some of the representations about myself and keith smart and the management group that was there at that time it was basically totally untrue what was represented there”this doesn’t look good at all  lying about past mistakes only adds fuel to the fire and ranadive certainly hasn’t earned the benefit of the doubt here petrie then offered his version of what happened“we had a group of people there that had been there and we had worked together for a long time and were part of the best heritage that the kings have ever had in sacramento i brought everybody together at different occasions and said “look we’re going to be professional here we’re going to continue to work like we’d work any other year we’ll prepare for the draft like we would every other year and ultimately we will assist any new people that may come in here and try and make them comfortable and get them situated”this is certainly not the way that ranadive describes the situation and makes it seem like the team could have been patient in their search for a new general manager  according to petrie they could have been even more patient when looking for a coach“the way it came across in the article is like ranadivé came in there and there was nobody there nobody wanted to be there keith smart wanted to be there he had a year left on his contract he didn’t get a discussion or an interview he got a second phone call in his car that they weren’t going to keep him”the idea that keith smart wasn’t interested in continuing as the head coach didn’t sound right in the first place and this seems to be a more likely scenario head coaching jobs aren’t easy to come by and the fact that smart was willing to be involved during the maloof era would suggest that he would’ve been open to giving the new group a chancethis may not be the final response  many people were discussed during the interview and some of them may follow in petrie’s footsteps ranadive may even choose to comment again especially considering the harsh nature of petrie’s words  ranadive was discussing some sensitive topics so it will be interesting to see

gotten off to a curryesque start however as he averaged just  points on  percent shooting and  rebounds per game with the pelicanscomparisons of hield and curry date back to the formers senior year in norman which was one of the best singleseason shooting performances in recent ncaa history hield averaged  points and  rebounds while knocking down four threes per game and winning the john r wooden award for the nations best college basketball playerthe sooners reached the final four largely on the back of hields individual excellence which included a point outing in the round of  and  points in the elite eight before eventual champion villanova knocked them out with curry in the midst of rewriting the nbas record book and hield soaring to stardom the comparisons were somewhat naturallike hield curry stayed in college until he was an upperclassman his huge scoring outbursts also served as a preview for his nba ascent—including some notable moments leading underdog davidson to the elite eight in  heading into the draft some scouts questioned currys ability to create shots off the dribble because of his reliance on screens in collegebuddy hield vs the

player during his freshman season at oklahoma and would have been a borderline firstrounder had he come out after his junior year his glimpses of true superstardom did not come until his senior yearand while comparisons between the two were somewhat understandable a year ago hields nba production to date has not hinted at that type of potential hield has been wildly inconsistent beginning as
