holdings gnc courage  conviction investing longshort equity bonds special situations growth at reasonable pricemarketplacemarket adventuressummaryi share my thoughts on gncs q results and conference callgnc is lapping very easy q and q samestore sales comparisons for the second half of i reiterate my  to  price targeti wasnt planning on writing a public site piece on gnc holdings inc gnc as i have been focusing more of my time and energy on the interacting with my more engaged marketplace readers however my new portfolio manager friend the guy who is a pm for a multibillion dollar european equity fund for whom i helped make a lot of money in his pa in shares of gnc pinged me this morning that the great goldman sachs issued an analyst note where mr stephen tanal reiterated his  price target i almost fell off my chair when i read it i view this as a call to action and this has caused me to share some of my key gnc insights as i have actively been on the gnc trail since january  i took an inordinate risk to my reputation by going way out on a limb and pounding the table when i reiterated my gnc recommendation in the low  and mid s keep in mind that i was the sole voice in the analyst wilderness championing the gnc turnaround when the entire sell side had either sell or neutral price targets it is during our darkest hours that we face what we want to be when we grow up and i would argue that i answered the call and earned my mettle keep in mind the wellcoordinated bear raid by the masters of the universe motu an assault that included nearly  million shares at the peak being sold short from january    may   despite this tremendous selling pressing and repeated negative commentary from the riskaverse sell side gnc was the little engine that could so despite the fact that i am going to probably lose a few marketplace subscribers for sharing my work to the public site i am compelled to do so given the goldman sachs  price target this article appeared on my marketplace service this morning at  am sorry for the delay in writing this as i was stuck in traffic during the live q  gnc earnings call after reading it i thought it was excellent the only element of the call that caught me slightly off guard was the my man robert moran didnt appear to have this usual spunk perhaps he too wanted to deliver a knockout punch to the master of the universe shorts although q results were encouraging and are vectoring in the right direction from a nd derivative perspective we needed another  million of revenue to have had the motu running for hills before i delve into the report i want to reiterate what i said yesterday at  am and then again at  am the shortterm future trajectory of gncs stock price will be determined by the tug of war between the motu and the buy side we know that as of july th gnc had  million shares short we also know that as of march st the  institutional holders list will be available on august th that gnc has had weak buy side support my point is that if the motu are concerned enough to cover and the buy side is intrigued enough to accumulate some shares then gnc will rise from yesterdays close of  to  to  and in short order if on the other hand the motu remain stubborn and triple down on their bad short bet and the buy side waits for one more good quarter then gnc will remain range bound between  and  said differently on the buy side there are the big  movers and shakers fidelity capital group owner of american funds wellington management franklin templeton and t rowe price they are the biggest and some of the best active money managers in the united states my swag estimate is that these five shops control upwards of  trillion in aum and probably collectively control  billion to  trillion of equity capital with an active money management mandate my longwinded point is that if some major pms at one of these shops fido is already invested decide to enter the fray they will be buying at least a few million shares if not more think about that for a second if the pms want to get in then their traders will get an order ticket to buy  million to  million absolute dollars worth of gnc that said a i have no idea if the motu are concerned enough to cover b i have no idea if the buy side is brave enough to get long gnc for a turnaround next lets discuss q highlight from robert morans introductory remarks  million mygnc rewards members and  pro access members the pro access number is a little light gncs private label brands picked up  basis points since march as they have higher margins and they signed an exclusive deal with performix highlight from tricia tolivars introductory remarks best comps in six quarters better franchiseowned store comps and strength in china better than feared gross margins gained more clarity on its  million free cash flow target and stated the revolver will be paid down by the end of  conference call qa highlights see link to sa transcript reiterated the positive second half comps by the way lets dust off my model from my baking the cake piece and for new readers i posted the model to subscribers a few days earlier focus on q and q company owned revenue in other words the baseline that we are comping against in q  the baseline revenue per company owned stores was  in revenue per average store for the quarter in q  the baseline revenue per company owned stores was  in revenue per average store for the quarter q and q in q  the baseline revenue per company owned stores was  in revenue per average store for the quarter in q  the baseline revenue per company owned stores was  in revenue per average store for the quarter it is crystal clear that gnc should easily be able to post positive samestore sales during the nd half of  as it is lapping a very low bar this should keep the shorts up at night q and q next gnc has already closed  companyowned stores during the first half of  and it guided for an additional  to  more closings this will free up lots of working capital in the form of inventory dollars and should improve overall margins see here see here also note that gncs average lease is only  years so this gives it lots of flexibility and is a major advantage compared to other retailers with long lease commitments jpmorgans analyst tried to pin down tricia tolivar on bogo and she wasnt having it lets look at some numbers gross margin of  was better than feared note that sga was up  million hence eps was lower for the qoq period cash flow from operations was solid despite a big decrease in payables and accused liabilities some store closures but in line with expectations the international closure rate was a little higher than i would have liked but all in all nothing to be concerned about takeaway as i promised i didnt and have no plans of selling any of my  gnc shares i was very encouraged by the q  conference call my sense is that we will see  if not more for gncs stock within the next few months the late day big leg up into the last  minutes of yesterdays trading session came on a surge of massive volume which kind of tips the motu hands that they are looking for weaker prey to eat gnc has been proven as a rugged lion that is strong enough to fight off a packing of weasley hyenas also tricia tolivar seemed very impressive on the conference call here is the late day surge chart from

positions across client accounts second to only schwab the largest financial sector position the poor ficc results the last two quarters against very easy comps for the first half of  are worrisome although some of the commodities like crude oil copper and steel look to be bottoming that being said the fact is that with the sp  up  ytd as of june  and the credit markets and interest rates being fairly well behaved this doesnt even mention or discuss the recovery in emerging markets or europe typically goldman sachs prints money in this type of wall street environment and yet its not done well for two solid quarters for the capital markets morgan stanley made a solid commitment to the money management or advisor segment right after  and it has paid off in the stock price as morgan stanley reported decent results for q  and the stock price rallied post earnings goldmans valuation is hardly excessive like most financials but revenue growth is expected to remain tepid for the next few years the bottom line is that even with the republicans possibly making headway on tax reform and financial reform the us financial system isnt returning to the kind of proprietary trading that was the hallmark of the s from a practical shareholder perspective clients could get a similar business model with the benefit of corporate lending from jpmorgan nysejpm or bank of america nysebac and more earnings stability am i giving up that much potential upside in an environment of stable capital markets owning jpmorgan versus a goldman sachs hard to say but i dont think so the goal is to stay

the stocks and bonds the investors hold in fidelityheld brokerage accounts us bank is also participating as a lender a number of wall street brokerage houses offer these kinds of loans which can be a way for investors to get cash without selling investments for example a wealthy customer looking to buy a house may use his or her assets to make an allcash offer on a house in order to be more competitive and then later refinance the loan with a mortgage its become a growing business for wall street firms as trading revenue has declined due to the rise of discount brokerage houses and other cheaper forms of investing morgan stanley said last week that lending in its wealth management division grew  percent from a year earlier the goldman and us bank loans will be through a network of  wealth management firms that use fidelity as a clearinghouse for their clients assets not through fidelitys retail branches these are not k loans and are largely aimed at wealthy customers while the
