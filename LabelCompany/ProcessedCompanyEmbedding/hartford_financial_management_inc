the bridge that connects clients from where they are today to where they want to be tomorrow i founded hartford financial management inc in  to offer a clientfocused alternative to the common financial services model of investment management i believe that our firm has a duty to our clients to always place their interests ahead of our own this is one reason i structured the firm as an independent registered investment adviser i wanted to be free of the influence that large firms often place on their own proprietary products i believe that our firm has a duty to our clients to always place their interests ahead of our own this meant giving up many of the quick commissions and fees that the traditional financial services industry was built upon in order for us to obtain the objectivity that is inherent in our core beliefs it also meant laying the groundwork for longterm relationships and gaining opportunity to see wealth applied to future generations to achieving one’s personal and family goals to new businesses and to community activity r dario quiros   i worry my money isnt doing the best it cani worry i dont have the understanding time or inclination to manage my
