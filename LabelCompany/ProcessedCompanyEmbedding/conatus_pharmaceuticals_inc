about conatus pharmaceuticals cnat matthew michniewicz long only deep value special situations growthsummaryfocus on nash cirrhosis treatment with less industry competition than nash fibrosis treatments provides cnat with an alternate path to marketalthough further behind nash competition in pipeline maturity lead product emricasan has great potential for combination treatmentsmarket activity picking up as competition tightens and larger firms look to pick up smaller players to enter the fieldconatus pharmaceuticals inc nasdaqcnat is an earlystage developmental biotechnology company in the liver disease field its lead compound emricasan is an oral pancaspase protease inhibitor designed to slow or halt the damaging effects of inflammation and apoptosis in the liver it works by inhibiting human caspases in the liver which are enzymes that lead to processes of inflammation and cell death excessive caspase enzymatic activity as seen in severe liver disease leads to liver fibrosis cirrhosis and eventually the need for a transplant for survival conatus market outlook for emricasan is quite large as it is one of the multiple companies with products in development to deal with nash nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and its consequences briefly nash is a liver disease that resembles alcoholic liver disease but is found in individuals with little or no alcohol consumption its traits typically include a buildup of fat in the liver along with excessive inflammation and cell death nash is labeled as a silent disease since most patients with nash are asymptomatic and do not develop symptoms until latestage manifestations arise there are currently no approved treatments for nash and the potential market for the drugs that make it through their developmental and marketing stages successfully has been touted to be as high as  billion for a great overview of the main players in the nash field which includes some of cnats competition see logribel biostocks article nash drugs a comprehensive review of current clinical trials this is especially recommended as the rest of the article will assume the readers familiarity with the nash field and focus on conatus outlook in the market going forward emricasans mechanism of action makes it a unique broadbased treatment option liver disease typically progresses in the following fashion inflammation fibrosis asymptomatic cirrhosis symptomatic cirrhosis liver failure and need for transplant this progression of fibrosis and cirrhosis occurs as inflammation and cell death increases mediated by caspase activity leading to significant scarring and loss of liver function emricasan being a caspase inhibitor blocks the enzymatic pathways that lead to inflammation and cell death due to this very general mechanism emricasan has the potential to deal with the consequences of moderate to severe liver disease regardless of the specific disease causing the progression this positions emricasan uniquely in the field of nash as other competitors are developing drugs that focus on earlier stage intervention in the progression of nash rather than consequences of nash and liver disease in general in addition to this because emricasan works on the later stages of liver disease it is an interesting candidate to be used in combination therapies with other drugs that successfully make it to market for the treatment of nash at earlier stages of disease source cnat market potential for emricasan may be better than it appears currently the focus of most drug developers in the nash field is on dealing with nash fibrosis and earlystage interventions in the disease cycle conatus has taken a different approach with emricasan focusing primarily on laterstage cirrhosis treatment with emricasan  and for good reason as illustrated below from managements presentation at the  stifel healthcare conference on november   cirrhosis affects approximately  us adults with costs of up to  billion to the healthcare system  patients die each year from latestage liver disease where the only current cure is a liver transplant with a huge waiting list approx  waiting with  livers available each year source cnat taking a look at the market size advanced nash fibrosis ff stages approx  million us and eu patients does have a larger patient population base relative to nash cirrhosis f approx  million us and eu patients however when we take diagnosis rates into account the treatable diagnosed population sizes for patients with earlier nash fibrosis and nash cirrhosis equal out this is because nash is a silent disease as mentioned previously and patients do not seek treatment until they become symptomatic this results in a skewed diagnosis rate in favor of nash cirrhosis relative to nash fibrosis until better screening and diagnostic tools are developed to raise the level of diagnosed nash fibrosis patients the large estimated population size with nash fibrosis will not carry over into the group of patients who will be seeking treatment source cnat the next market factor that favors emricasan going forward is that there are far fewer drugs in development for nash cirrhosis compared to nash fibrosis currently approximately  different drugs are being explored as treatments for nash fibrosis while only two are being explored for nash cirrhosis  emricasan being one of them this lack of intense competition in the cirrhosis treatment field along with similar diagnosed market potential as nash fibrosis and potential combination treatments down the road with earlystage fibrosis treatments makes emricasan a unique player in the nash and general liver disease field source cnat clinical trial overview and timeline conatus currently has several clinical trials at various stages in process below is a general overview of these trials and their expected timelines please see the conference presentation slides for detailed breakdown source cnat  stifel healthcare conference on top of the studies shown above that are in progress management is planning an encorelf study with expectations to start in h  that seeks to get approval for a clinical endpoint rather than a surrogate endpoint and be classified as a phase  trial for liver cirrhosis if approved this will accelerate its time to market for such a treatment but it is not in any sense guaranteed management is having ongoing discussions to see whether a phase  trial will be appropriate although the higher likelihood is that it will need to do a phase b first this will be an announcement to watch for going into  depending on the results of the above trials management could have the data on hand to expand the scope of treatment for emricasan to earlier stages of liver diseases especially with histology endpoints used in its nf and polthcvsvr trials management has also stated it plans to release the threemonth followup openlabel results and analysis of its liver cirrhosis phase  trial in late early  besides this all other trials in progress have at least  topline result timelines making emricasan a long way away from getting through its developmental stages plan for conatus going forward managements plan for emricasan is to register it initially for treatments in patients with cirrhosis due to nash if emricasan is approved for this patient population in the us andor europe management seeks to build its own commercial organization to market emricasan along with its own sales team to target mds dealing with nash if emricasan continues to show strong clinical results management would look to expand emricasans use to larger patient populations through combination treatments and partnerships with other biopharmaceutical companies as of november   cnat had approximately  million shares outstanding as of september   cnat had  million cash on hand which at the current burn rate should be enough to last for another year or so in operationalclinical expenses cnat has a  million atm in place with mlv  co llc since august  of which it sold  shares for approximately  million net of expenses as of its november   q with the current share price share management may find itself diluting existing shareholders substantially to raise funds through its atm unless significant positive news emerges or a partnership is announced to help offset the costs of development this poses a risk to existing shareholders and the share price this is a concern going forward since there will be multiple trials in progress in  at what will be a much greater cash burn rate due to distant timelines for completion of current and planned trials management will need to find ways to raise the necessary capital preferably via partnership and then further stock dilution as needed market outlook for nash companies on september th  tobira therapeutics also an earlystage nash player got bought out for a massive premium by allergan nyseagn rocketing the microcap company from a market cap of  million to over  million this came after tobira announced disappointing phase b results where it did not meet its primary endpoints with the huge potential market in this field it isnt surprising to see bidding wars emerge for smallcap companies that may have a better drug candidate in development than the big pharma players do as a result of this buyout you can be sure that other players such as gilead nasdaqgild and pfizer nysepfe are paying attention and taking a look at whats available to pad their own pipelines with allergans ceo being quoted saying that the tobira deal was a very competitive situation that leads one to think that there is at least one other large pharma looking to buy out a smaller target if not a couple with potentially billions in repatriated capital coming back to the us via corporate tax cuts under trump this could be a very interesting area for acquisitions going forward summary emricasan is a unique play in the nash field due to its broad function in treating nash cirrhosis and potentially nash fibrosis and earlierstage liver disease with label expansion there is limited competition in the cirrhosis field with an almost equal diagnosed market size of patients needing treatment between nash cirrhosis and fibrosis although the timeline for reaching the market for emricasan is arguably quite distant relative to other nash players its broad mechanism of action could help it gain rapid market share through combination therapies down the road acting as a surprise factor is the sector cnat finds itself in with hungry large biopharms looking for potential buyouts or partnerships with the most promising drugs in development however it is always crucial to remember that the success of these microcap companies hinges on their main drug if future trials do not show positive results and management is unable to partner or sell sufficient shares to raise needed capital the company can always go under investment in this field is risky and often a gamble going forward cnat presents itself as an interesting player in the field with great potential if all goes as planned with its trials and financing needs

interconnected stiffening the liver structure and restricting blood flow through the liver cirrhosis and its complications cause over  deaths each year in the united states the conatus emricasan program has the potential to improve cirrhosis patients lives in two major ways it may help patients survive longer while waiting for a liver transplant it may improve their liver disease status so they no longer need a transplant conatus is studying treatment for patients with chronic liver disease including compensated asymptomatic liver cirrhosis decompensated symptomatic liver cirrhosis causes of chronic decompensation or liver failure include infections such as subacute bacterial peritonitis hepatitis c virus hcv hepatitis b virus hbv metabolic causes such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash autoimmune diseases alcohol independent published studies have been conducted on cirrhosis treatment they have shown that levels of caspasecleaved cytokeratin  cck a key biomarker of inflammation and apoptosis are elevated in liver cirrhosis patients these levels correlate with extent of liver inflammation and cholestasis managing cirrhosis there are no approved diseasemodifying treatments for cirrhosis there are currently two main objectives for the management of patients with liver cirrhosis specific treatment of any identifiable causes of chronic liver function such as hcv or hbv prevention of the development or progression of key signs of decompensation signs of decompensation may include portal hypertension ascites hepatic encephalopathy esophageal varices with or without hemorrhage the continual progression of liver cirrhosis may eventually lead patients to require a liver transplant during this procedure the diseased liver is replaced by a donor liver or part of one there are not enough donor livers available for all cirrhosis patients without a liver transplant progressive cirrhosis eventually leads to liver failure and

careful reading of conatus ceo shows a reasonable strategy for start up companies it must be clear to conatus that even if its flagship product gets through phaseii with flying colors in the current environment it cannot rely on vc or the market to go to production it will sink all company resources to manufacture and market the new miracle drug and without a product it is unlikely to see a bidding war between big pharma to acquire the company instead the strategy now is to continue its rd on new drugs or derivatives for which a secure and reliable source of income from novartis by licensing its lead product is needed in other words conatus will not be at the mercy of the ups and downs of the market hoping to survive from one quarter to another it will wait for better times next
