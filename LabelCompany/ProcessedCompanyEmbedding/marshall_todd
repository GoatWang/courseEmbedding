willing to do one day only representation i also highly recommend legal voice as the best nonprofit organization for getting legal advice and referrals to attorneys for free after leaving a voice message for richard on a friday he said he had an opening and could be my legal representative for my  am court hearing on monday although it was easter weekend and he was spending time with his family he contacted me over a dozen times per email to get details about the court hearing we met before the court hearing and richard was very focused on getting the details from me he needed to achieve a successful outcome he has the experience to get straight to the point during the court hearing i noticed he had a stack of legal printouts with yellow sticky notes which demonstrated to me he had really invested time into preparing for a one day only representation and was not out to just earn a flat fee without working for it richard cole is a rare excellent experienced lawyer who cares and works hard for his clients i was so impressed by his work ethic i then hired him to represent me on additional legal issues and each time i asked for his help he provided service that knocked my socks off richard has stopped me from making mistakes in my court cases and in my decisions i personally do not want a lawyer who does not have the strength of character to tell me when i am doing something that will not produce positive outcomes richard gives practical advice he emphasizes staying focused and professional in approaching a problem i hope this review has been helpful and one day richard cole can help you also i was encouraged by legal voice to not thank them but to thank the lawyer they referred me tobienstock law llcz o ratedthe best divorce attorney in

eric j schurmanfreeandhappy ratedi obviously didnt meet eric si obviously didnt meet eric schurman during the best of times but i cant recommend him enough for making a painful period a lot easier to get through i found him through his positive reviews online and now i’m glad to be able to add my voice to the growing chorus of praise he handled my case with professionalism and compassion understanding how difficult this time was for me his knowledge of the law and of my rights gave me confidence and put me at ease throughout the process his response time to phone calls and emails is amazingly swift which made me feel less like ‘just another client’ and more like i was being taken care of eric displayed a thorough command of the law and a gift for delivering measured wise counsel at every step his eventempered and compassionate demeanor was also reassuring—and even better he won our case i am so thankful i had him on my side i would recommend eric to my closest friends knowing they would be in good handscharles h williams attorney and counselor at law psjeffrey z ratedcharles williams is an excellent attorney i hired him because i knew he had a great reputation and the fact that he was also named attorney of the year by his peers didnt hurt either he assisted my son in a serious matter that not only could have prevented him from attending college but also would have had longterm ramifications for years to come charles was able to find a resolution that was fair and reasonable and gave my son the opportunity to attend college and to move forward as a young adult without a black mark on his name not only did the judge comment on the fast resolution in the case but the prosecutor went out of his way to tell me that i had hired an excellent attorney equally important in my view was the wisdom he shared with my son about choices in life  how to make the right ones and how to avoid the wrong ones he has taken that to heart and thanks to charles is heading in the right direction with a bright future ahead of himlaw offices of kevin tromboldruslan ratedmost outstanding and trustwortmost outstanding and trustworthy lawyerkevin has taken care of many of my

represent me he is the best the only attorney i would hire to represent me in any criminal court he has done a superb job and i am very happy to have such an understandable at the same time aggressive lawyer that will do everything in his power to help you goldberg  jonesdanroberts ratedwhen i first came to goldberg when i first came to goldberg jones i was looking for a custody attorney who would represent me without being too aggressive and expensive i had already interviewed several attorneys and was rapidly getting discouraged in my search thats when i met scott marlow his affable yet straight forward approach to my situation put me at ease which gave me the reassurance that he would represent my interests without any drama andor courtroom theatrics scott always presented me with several options that were thoroughly researched and often took the conservative approach thanks to scotts outstanding knowledge of family law and personable character i now have full custody of my two children thank you scottlaw office of eric j schurmanjdman ratedtheir is not enough good things in the world to describe this fantastic lawyer i was very impressed with his knowledge of the law and

slime ball lawyer just tell him the truth and he will be honest with you yea its going to cost you but its worth every penny if you got a brain in your head and your back against the wall i am telling you this is the go to guythank you a million times eric brown stuartbshowers ratedstuart brown sets aside the ststuart brown sets aside the stereo types you think of when you hear the title lawyer

another paycheck ticket for him we spent  years in custody court fighting for my daughter with stuarts dedication to my family and i we were able to remove my daughter from a dangerous situation and bring her home my family and i will forever be in debt to stuart brown and his staff lynn pollock attynk ratedafter working with lynn this past year i told several friends about her wonderful service and support they were surprised because they had read some bad reviews about lynn and her firm i now see what they were referring to and i must say i am very disappointed that more of her clients havent responded to this negative bashing of a fine attorney lynn was recommended to me by several highprofile lawyers in king county and my experience with both lynn and her assistant robin was not only helpful but reassuringi would recommend her in a heart beatgoldberg  jonesbazillionairemooney ratednatalie rasmussen years ago i retained natalie rasmussen for my child support modification case

ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her
