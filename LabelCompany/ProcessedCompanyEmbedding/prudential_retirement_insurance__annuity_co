year  traditional ira and roth ira contributions received between january  and the tax filing deadline may be attributed to tax year  written instructions indicating attribution to the previous tax year must accompany the contribution or else the contribution will be attributed to the current tax year the federal tax filing deadline for tax year  is april   ira checks that are received after april   but on or before april   must be accompanied with proof that the check was postmarked to the agentfinancial professional on or before april   proof should be a copy or fax of the envelope with the postmark or statement of proof of delivery by the usps or courier service ie ups or federal express not the actual envelope otherwise the contribution will be attributed to the current tax year all tax year contributions received after april   will be coded with the  tax year new contracts must be issued on or before april   for a contribution to be attributed to the  tax year even if a contribution is made with accompanying attribution instructions prior to the tax filing deadline all sep ira contributions are coded for the current calendar year no exceptions  if my contract is owned by a trust and is not subject to u why was the form r coded with a  in box  when im over  entity owned contracts ie trusts are not subject to u will always use distribution code  as there is no date of birth for an entity except in the case of a grantor trust distributions from a grantor trust are reported based on the grantors date of birth dob and it will be coded as a  for an early distribution or as a  for normal distribution based on the grantors dob  why wasnt my form r coded as a disability payment the withdrawal form did not indicate disability you can file irs form  and would have to prove to the irs on your own that the disability exception applies  why is my entire distribution taxable for nonqualified contracts there are  possible reasons the distribution was all earnings it did not contain any return of cost basis the contract is aggregated for qualified contracts except for qualified trustee owned pension plans and  plans since some or all of the distribution may be taxable as ordinary income for the tax year in which the distribution is made we report all distributions as fully taxable on irs form r if a portion of the distribution is not taxable you would indicate that on your own return qualified contracts are funded with pretax dollars and prudential doesnt track cost basis nonqualified are funded with after tax dollars and earnings are taxable and generally come out first  why is box b taxable amount not determined checked on my r taxable amount not determined is used on nonqualified accounts that were funded with a  exchange where the prior institution did not send us the cost basis for roth ira contracts we report all distributions as taxable amount not determined  why does my form r show such a high taxable amount compared to my cost basis if the taxable amount seems high this contract is most likely a nonqualified annuity that is part of an aggregated group section e  of the internal revenue code requires that all annuities entered into after october   be aggregated and treated as a single deferred annuity contract for the purpose of determining the amount of taxable gain includible in gross income aggregation applies to all contracts purchased by the same contract owner from the same insurance company and its affiliates during the same calendar year all nonqualified annuity contracts issued to the same contract owner by the same insurance company or affiliate in the same calendar year they are treated as a single contract for tax gain purposes aggregated groups are determined by the tin of the owner aggregation rules do not apply to qualified contracts immediate annuities contracts subject to u of the internal revenue code and contracts issued prior to october    why did i receive tax form r if i converted my ira into a roth ira an ira to roth conversion is generally fully taxable taxable amounts are included in income in the year of conversion subject to ordinary income tax  withholding applies unless election out rmd if applicable should be removed before the conversion amounts converted from an eligible ira to a roth ira are required to be included in the customers taxable income in the year of conversion generally this includes deductible contributions made to the ira and any earnings on those contributions and the present value of the actuarial benefit if applicable a form r will be issued reflecting the conversion from the traditional to the roth ira the form r will reflect a distribution code of either a  under  ½ with an exception or  over  ½ in addition a form  will be generated to reflect the amounts converted to the roth ira  why did i receive tax form r when i received these funds as a death claim death proceeds from an annuity contract are taxable to the extent that there is gain under normal circumstances a beneficiary is responsible for the income tax on the death benefit they receive however there are exceptions to this general rule as indicated below on an annuitant driven contract the death proceeds are payable at the death of the annuitant and are payable to the beneficiary if the annuitant is the owner tax reporting is to the beneficiary if the annuitant and owner are different tax reporting is to the owner on an owner driven contract the proceeds become payable upon death of the owner for single owned contracts the proceeds are paid to and reportable to the beneficiary for jointly owned contracts if the surviving owner is not the beneficiary the surviving owner will receive the tax reporting however the beneficiary will receive the proceeds on an entity owned contract the death proceeds are payable at the death of the annuitant and are paid to the beneficiary the tax reporting is to the owner
