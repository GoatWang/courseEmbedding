immigration law current investigations services free portfolio review free immigration consultation business litigation alternative fee arrangements blog contact estate planning subscribe losses in cnl lifestyle properties november  0 salas wang llc is announcing its investigation into cnl lifestyle properties a “lifestyle” real estate investment trust headquartered in orlando florida    investors in cnl  may have lost over 0 of their principal in the investment  we believe there are claims against the company and that stockbrokers have been selling this investment to individuals without adequately disclosing the grave risks   cash flow risks “we may have difficulty funding distributions solely from cash flow from operations which could reduce the funds we have available for investments and your overall return”  annual report p    inconsistent stock pricing  “the price of our shares is subjective and may not bear any relationship to what a stockholder could receive if their shares were resold” id p    stock pricing based on a nonmarket price  the reit “determined the offering price of our shares in our sole discretion based on  the price that we believed investors would pay for our shares  estimated fees to be paid to third parties and to our advisor and its affiliates and  the expenses of this offering and funds we believed should be available for us to invest in properties loans and other permitted investments”  id   no public market for shares  “there is no public market for our shares on which to base market value and there can be no assurance that one will develop” id   unfavorable market conditions  “our loans may be affected by unfavorable real estate market conditions when we make loans we are at risk of default on those loans caused by many conditions beyond our control including local and other economic conditions affecting real estate values and interest rate levels we do not know whether the values of the properties collateralizing mortgage loans will remain at the levels existing on the dates of origination of the loans if the values of the underlying properties drop or in some instances fail to rise our risk will increase and the value of our interests may decrease”  id p     acquisition of distressed properties  when we acquire property by foreclosure following defaults under our mortgage bridge or mezzanine loans we have the economic and liability risks as the owner of such property this additional liability could adversely impact our returns on mortgage investments”  id p     lack of protection from default  further if there are defaults under our loans we may not be able to repossess and sell the underlying properties or other security quickly the resulting time delay could reduce the value of our investment in the defaulted loans an action to foreclose on a mortgaged property securing a loan is regulated by state statutes and rules and is subject to many of the delays and expenses of other lawsuits if the defendant raises defenses or counterclaims in the event of default by a mortgagor these restrictions among other things may impede our ability to foreclose on or sell the mortgaged property or to obtain proceeds sufficient to repay all amounts due on our loan any failure or delay by a borrower in making scheduled payments to us may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders  id p    subordinated and unsecured loans “we may make loans on a subordinated and unsecured basis and may not be able to collect outstanding principal and interest although our loans to third parties are usually collateralized by properties pledged by such borrowers we have made loans that are unsecured andor subordinated in right of payment to such third parties’ existing and future indebtedness in the event of a foreclosure bankruptcy liquidation winding up reorganization or other similar proceeding relating to such third party and in certain other events such third party’s assets may only be available to pay obligations on our unsecured loans after the third party’s other indebtedness has been paid as a result there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay the principal or interest on the unsecured loans we may make”  id p    lack of company oversight  “we will not control the management of our properties in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may not operate certain types of properties we acquire or participate in the decisions affecting their daily operations our success therefore will depend on our ability to select qualified and creditworthy tenants and managers who can effectively manage and operate the properties our tenants will be responsible for maintenance and other daytoday management of the properties and because our revenues will largely be derived from rents our financial condition will be dependent on the ability of thirdparty tenants andor operators to operate the properties successfully we will attempt to enter into leasing agreements with tenants having substantial prior experience in the operation of the type of property being rented however there can be no assurance that we will be able to make such arrangements additionally if we elect to treat property we acquire as a result of a borrower’s default on a loan or a tenant’s default on a lease as ‘foreclosure property’ for federal income tax purposes we will be required to operate that property through an independent contractor over whom we will not have control if our tenants or thirdparty operators are unable to operate the properties successfully or if we select unqualified managers then such tenants and operators might not be able to pay our rent or generate sufficient propertylevel operating income for us which could adversely affect our financial condition”  id p       conflicts of interest  “joint venture partners may have different interests than we have which may negatively impact our control over our ventures investments in joint ventures involve the risk that our coventurer may have economic or business interests or goals which at a particular time are inconsistent with our interests or goals that the coventurer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions requests policies or objectives or that the coventurer may experience financial difficulties and be unable to fund its share of required capital contributions among other things actions by a coventurer might subject assets owned by the joint venture to liabilities in excess of those contemplated by the terms of the joint venture agreement or to other adverse consequences this risk is also present when we make investments in securities of other entities if we do not have full control over a joint venture the value of our investment will be affected to some extent by a third party that may have different goals and capabilities than ours as a result joint ownership of investments and investments in other entities may adversely affect our returns on investments and therefore cash available for distributions to our stockholders may be reduced”  id pp  if you are a cnl investor
