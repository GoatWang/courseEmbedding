procedures work stem cell treatmentssame day stem cell protocol adult stem cells are cells from your own body that can renew themselves and turn into other cells differentiate they live inside all of us in various tissues poised to leap into action to repair damage as it occurs as we age or have big injuries we may not be able to recruit enough of these cells to the site to fully repair the area regenexx stem cell procedures help overcome this problem by extracting stem cells from an area of high volume then concentrating the cells and reinjecting them into the damaged area to help the body heal naturally our patented stem cell procedures can be used for a wide range of conditions and are the tool of choice for injuries arthritis and other conditions that may be more significant than what may be treated with our platelet rich plasma or platelet lysate procedures stem cell procedure details blood platelet treatmentssuper concentrated platelet rich plasma  advanced platelet lysate procedures platelet rich plasma prp and platelet lysate injection treatments contain healing growth components from your own blood that increase your body’s natural ability to repair itself the use of prp to repair joint tendon ligament and muscle injuries is becoming well known thanks to exposure from professional athletes platelet injection treatments are effective because they have a stimulating effect on the stem cells within the targeted area making those stem cells work harder to heal damaged tissues our advanced platelet procedures are more pure and concentrated than those created by the automated machines used at most regenerative medicine clinics platelet procedures are commonly used for soft tissue injuries mild arthritis and spine conditions platelet procedure details a complete stem cell protocol – not just a single procedure the regenexx patented stem cell protocol has been researched and continually improved for more than a decade the protocol used in the united states typically involves a series of injections that take place over the course of approximately one week the stem cell extraction and reinjection happens during the same day while the other two injection steps happen before and after the same day stem cell procedure and are designed to enhance the results of the stem cell procedure the best possible patient outcomes at regenexx® no corners are cut our regenerative procedures are  focused on producing the best possible patient outcomes without trying to balance quality with profitability  focused on orthopedics we don’t treat everything and we’re

autologous platelet rich plasma with a platelet recovery superior to  and a concentration factor of fold although the system is technically capable of producing significantly higher platelet concentrations it is not what research shows to be beneficial for clinical use more and more studies demonstrate that concentrations of platelets  to  times over the baseline show more robust healing rates than those with concentrations of  to  times the baseline some studies even showed that too high platelet concentrations may actually have negative effects in a in vivo study it was shown that highly concentrated platelet preparations had an inhibitory influence on osteoblast activity probably due to unwanted inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of growth factors at such high concentrations similarly an in vitro study demonstrated that platelet concentration over fold resulted in a reduction in proliferation and a suboptimal effect on osteoblast function white blood cells in tissue

and are associated with the inflammatory response they release a large variety of highly active antimicrobial substances and proteases uncontrolled release of these factors can cause severe damage to the tissue delay healing rates and increase the risk of scarring thanks to the regenkit bct technology more than  of the granulocytes are removed from aprp® the few white blood cells still present in
