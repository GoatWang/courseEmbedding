september   jeff today is september  my payments are due on the st why is it that when i pull up my unit it to pay my bill it shows past due that is causes me to get angry it is a stupid policy and it is totally unprofessional to say i am past due when i pay on the due date there is nothing that says i am required to pay before my due date nor is it a smart marketing plan why would i pay before my due date offer me  off for paying early and i will consider it but i am not past due if i pay at am on the st day of the month when the payment and contract say i am due to make a payment if it is due on the first i will pay on the st and therefore it is paid on time correct it seems like a simple programing item to show people past due on the nd of the month doesnt it finally my unit is supposed
