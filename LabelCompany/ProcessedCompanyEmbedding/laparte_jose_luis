for joining our earnings call for the third quarter of this fiscal year  net warehouse sales for the period were  million an increase of  compared to the same quarter a yearago comparable sales for the  weeks ended june   were net income for the third quarter was  million or  per share compared to  million or  per share in the comparable prior year period sales in our central america segment were up by  panama and guatemala recorded the strongest growth in excess of  and we also saw positive sales growth in el salvador honduras and nicaragua costa rica was the only market in central america were we saw a decrease in sales compared to last year while currency headwinds have been a factor sales in local currency grew  in the technical difficulty continuing to invest in the costa rican market which i will touch on further for the caribbean we only saw a growth of  compared to last year both trinidad and barbados experienced negative sales growth as have been the case for the past several quarters trinidad our largest market in that segment has been experiencing difficult economic conditions which is impacting consumer demand and our members shopping with transactions down  from a yearago on the other hand membership renewal rates in trinidad continue to remain at  and our new member additions are on plan which positions us well should the economic environment improve foreign currency liquidity remains an issue in trinidad although our incountry and corporate teams are doing a good job in their efforts to source tradable currencies to support our business as a result we are not limiting any more shipments as we did for several weeks in technical difficulty and december during the second quarter trinidad was down  partially impacted by actions we took to limit shipments in the third quarter the sales decrease was only  barbados while not technical difficulty overall impact on the company sales as trinidad is also experiencing difficulties which is impacting sales now moving to colombia technical difficulty have good sales results with a growth of  which includes our new chia club that opened in september   from a comparable clubs at standpoint the increase was nearly  even with the effect of cannibalized sales particular in our salitre bogota club we saw an increase of  in transactions and the technical difficulty was above  which was helped somewhat by a better exchange rate in the current quarter the average exchange rate was  colombian pesos to the us dollar a yearago it was  at  change in local currency our average ticket was up  as we continue to focus our merchandising efforts on growing sales with the large membership base we have in colombia i will talk more about colombia when we get to membership results warehouse margins for the quarter were  compared to  a yearago the improvement is largely explained by the higher margin in colombia which show an increase of  basis points in the past quarter compared to last year again a reflection of the technical difficulty conditions and the fact that last year in the same period we have more markdowns given the currency variations in the noncolombia business we also had a yearago more markdowns given a softer easter season in some markets from a membership perspective we finished the third quarter with more than  accounts representing a  growth in the membership base membership income was  million reflecting a  increase versus last year on the same quarter membership renewal rate finished at  which is an improvement compared to the renewal rate at the end of fiscal year  where we finished at  if we exclude colombia the renewal rate for the quarter was  we have seen improvements also in colombia where we added more than  accounts in the beginning of the fiscal year and the month renewal rate for the country is at  compared to only  at the start of fiscal year  as a reminder in colombia we increased the membership fee in february  the increase was  pesos in local currency or about  we have not experienced any reduction in renewal rates or a slowing of new member signups resulting from that increase when translated to us dollars a membership in colombia now yields approximately  compared to  in most of our other markets besides the numbers let me add a few comments on important activities which occurred during the past quarter costa rica have been a challenging market for us in recent months with respect to sales growth it is still however our most successful overall market generating the highest level of sales and income for the company part of our problem with our sales growth in that market is how successful and crowded our existing clubs are making it sometimes difficult for our members to access our parking lots and shop with us that is why we’re excited to see the progress in construction  in constructing our seven club in the country the location is in the area santa ana it will be close to one of our highest volume clubs in san jose escazu although we expect some cannibalization to that location we are looking forward to incremental sales for that from the new club and an improved shopping experience in the existing escazu club the grand opening is still planned for the first week of october  and coupled with merchandising and operational improvements we think we can better serve our costa rican members going forward in terms of expansion i’m happy that were able to announce this morning the acquisition of about  square meters of land in the east area of santo domingo in the dominican republic this will be our third club in the city the fourth in the country of dominican republic we are starting construction in the next week or two and we expect to have this club open in the spring of  besides to our new warehouse clubs that were opened in fiscal year  we have been working on some of our expansion projects in existing clubs we just started with the expansion of our pradera club in guatemala city this is a very successful club that has limited parking and smaller than average sales floor space while adding more parking spaces to the existing parking deck and increasing the sales floor by expanding into areas formerly occupied by other retail tenants we have started but dont expect to finish expansion before the holiday season given the challenges of constructions while the club continues to operate but we will have it completed in calendar  before speaking about june sales i would like to address an important topic for all retailers related to the online channel given recent activity particularly in the united states where retail companies are taking action to strengthen their online presence or even companies looking at combining their online activity with more traditional brickandmortar business  businesses via acquisition we realize that this is an important trend in meeting future consumer needs and although the online channel is less developing in our markets we at pricesmart are developing a strategic plan and investing in technology to satisfy the shopping needs of our business and retail members we believe that is done well we can integrate the best of our traditional brickandmortar warehouse clubs with the new trends of online shopping and trade the right omnichannel experience for our members we dont look at the online business in isolation but instead we believe it should be fully integrated with the other activities we have right now that allow us to serve more than  million members accounts in the  countries where we do business we also believe we have a privilege condition given the fact that through our membership base we know who our members are and what they buy we also have a well developed and extensive distribution network within the region along with a deep understanding of our markets if done well again we see an opportunity for pricesmart to take full advantage of the trends towards increasing online shopping capabilities and integrate them with our existing club and distribution infrastructure now june sales which we released this morning total sales for june  were  million an increase of  compared to the same month last year for the four weeks ended july   comparable warehouse club sales for the  clubs open at least  months was  while trinidad and barbados struggles continues we saw an improvement in costa rica and colombia continues to perform well in june with two more months to complete our fiscal year  we feel that we’re in a good position with our merchandise inventories and competitive pricing and good renewal as we end the fiscal year in technical difficulty weeks we will start seeing some red and green in our clubs with the first arrival of holidays items for our early in strategy with that i just want to thank you for joining us today and after johns remarks we will take your questions john heffner thank you jose luis let me cover a few additional items total gross margins in the period included the effect of a lease liability charge associated with a difference in cash flows over the remainder of our lease term in the space we vacated in miami upon moving into our new distribution center in our last call i indicated that charge would be approximately  however we ended up recognizing expenses of  in the period was not only included the lease liability charge but also the current period cost of space that weve not yet sublet in a charge related to exiting part of our lease in total this impacted gross margin by about  basis points efforts continue to sublease space or find tenants that will cause landlord to release as our obligation in the upcoming quarter we will likely incur some additional cost in rent expense for which deals have not yet been finalized total sga expenses increased  basis points in the quarter as a percent of sales low or negative comp growth particularly in large markets like costa rica and trinidad resulted in higher club expense ratios on the other hand colombia continues to have good expense leverage with sales  with it sales growth is experiencing warehouse expense as a percent of sales in colombia improved  basis points we’ve slightly higher interest income compared to the third quarter of last year but interest expense was higher by  resulting from both the debt associated with the acquisition of the miami distribution center in q and a  million loan we took in trinidad this quarter as part of our efforts to address the illiquidity situation foreign exchange transactions and revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities resulted in a  million currency gain in the quarter compared to a  loss in q last year devaluing currency movements in some of our countries during the quarter resulted in currency gains in those countries that had a net us dollar asset position like jamaica and the dominican republic and in honduras a country with which we have exposure to the lempira the currency is strengthened by  resulting in a net gain filing in trinidad despite higher transaction costs for converting tt dollars into us dollars we made an allowance for that additional cost in our operating model resulting in an overall net currency gain the effective tax rate for the period was  compared to  last year the beneficial change was again attributable to the intercompany transactions between pricesmart inc the us entity and pricesmart colombia related to our ongoing market development efforts in colombia and the improving conditions compared to prior years when losses in colombia have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate q last year was the first quarter where we began experiencing this lower level of effective tax rate and which we will anniversary in this upcoming q from a balance sheet perspective the company ended the third quarter with cash of a  million an increase of  million during the quarter operating activities in the quarter added  million we invested  million in various capital projects including the construction activity associated with the santa ana costa rica warehouse club and we had net cash from financing activities of  million with that jose luis and id be happy to take your questions gary i will turn things over to you questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from dave king with roth capital please go ahead unidentified analyst thank you this is indiscernible on for dave look likes part of the sequential decline in the club gross margins which was due to the vacated lease charge can you talk about the other factors that weighed was it mainly currency and how then should we think about the outlook given these ongoing currency pressures in traditionally devaluing markets where unlike colombia you’ve operated there for longer periods of time jose luis laparte i’m not sure i follow your question exactly can you repeat the  its regarding gross margins you said unidentified analyst yes exactly its basically talking about was there anything outside of the vacated lease charge that weighed and were there anything outside of the currency pressures that weighed on that as well jose luis laparte no but basically we had an improvement versus last year and other than that the currency changes happen all the time in different countries we didnt have except for a little bit in costa rica during one of the month of the quarter we didn’t really have any big changes in currencies in any of the other markets so that’s something where  i guess is mixing to our numbers at any given time we are always having experiences of changing prices of  or moving prices up or down depending on currency situations but again i don’t recall any big move that will have been i guess drastic in terms of changing our gross margin we actually have compared to what we budget compared to our budgets we were right there in terms of gross margin i hope that gives you a little bit more of explanation i’m not sure i  that’s what you were asking unidentified analyst yes not that helped i think i will try to move on to my last question and on the last earnings call you mentioned the potential to take the platinum memberships to other markets besides costa rica i just wanted to see if there were any updates there jose luis laparte yes we are about to launch it we should be  if nothing changes we should be doing that at the beginning of our fiscal year  which is starting in september and we have two markets that we will be launching that effort so everything is about ready and we’re excited with that obviously the experience in costa rica after a few years has been good we saw the better renewal coming from those platinum members we have higher spending from those platinum members and obviously creating that loyalty to continue shopping with us which is at the end one of the most important thing so yes members are happy with that in costa rica and launching it in two more countries and we will report on that on  probably for our next call unidentified analyst okay great thank you everyone and good luck in the next quarter jose luis laparte thank you operator the next question comes from ronald bookbinder with coker palmer please go ahead ronald bookbinder good morning jose luis laparte good morning ronald ronald bookbinder the colombian peso has declined approximately  since the end of the quarter while its nothing compared to what you experienced in a not too long ago when it declined almost  but should we expect to see some pressure on the memberships and on the buying activity in colombia given the recent decline in the colombian peso jose luis laparte ronald i think we are pretty much  i will speak for the market i think that consumers and the members digested the evaluation already the other results like valuations i was also looking at this morning report on the colombian peso we tuck it every day it was showing at  difference and as you mentioned its about  i don’t think we have noticed any big changes and one of the reasons might be obviously we are now i guess we have a higher base of items that we’re producing  that are produced locally which obviously have less of an effect in the currency changes for the most part i think in the colombian market somewhere in between  little above a little below it is fine with them i dont think they consider about a devaluation sometimes it actually appreciate we can have a couple of weeks where it goes up and then it goes slightly down so i think i havent seen any effect and in membership our renewals as i reported were at the highest ever we believe we actually track at  which compares i believe id say its  at the end of the calendar year so its an improvement  an important improvement  compared to the  so we dont see any impact on that  on renewals either side so i think things are trending on the right direction and again a lot of that is  our mix has changed and we’re seeing good results with the items that we have been developing in the local  from the local market including some privatelabel items that are doing very good and its actually giving us the opportunity to export so a lot of good things happen in colombia finally after a couple of years of pretty challenging times i hope that answers your question ronald ronald bookbinder yes and speaking on the new locally sourced items and privatelabel they are doing very well in colombia and i think on the last conference call you talked about possibly taking them to other stores in your network is there any progress or update on that and how could that benefit in revenues and margins going forward jose luis laparte well we definitely  we already have a couple of items that were developed a yearago we have towels that were developed more than a yearago and sourcing them also to other country what we did is we look at the pricing obviously that these towels or any items when we look at sourcing into other countries it is replacing an item an existing item which was the case for the towels we were making sure that we were landing them on a better cost than the other products coming either from the us or whatever then the towels were coming from so that’s one of the things were looking at so it gives us either the benefit of better margins or more likely reducing our prices and trying to get more sales and like that that we have a couple of items that are getting developed we shipped some to smaller markets to start with and then eventually we started to push them to a possible eventually to old markets so its a combination  combination of efforts to try to push more on exports out of colombia which benefits obviously our relation with the local vendors in the country the fact that we’re not buying only for the seven clubs in colombia but more for maybe  or eventually  or close to  clubs in the future now that’s kind of our vision for all those colombia exports and great items again quality is there especially when we put our name on a privatelabel item we make sure that the quality is there to take it not only to the colombia clubs for the rest of the markets ronald ronald bookbinder and inventory was up  versus the  warehouse revenue increase is the inventory at markdowns risk or why the building in the inventory jose luis laparte no when we have been looking at that i dont believe we have any markdown on our seasonal inventory we just finished the season of what we call like the carnival season semana santa we got into the summer season we got new programs running in the clubs right now its furniture and other things that we are doing i think what we’re doing different is we’re trying to push more sales through buying inventory having the clubs opportunity to do the right and caps to put items in the front fence to put items in the seasonal area flex area any opportunity i think in the past sometimes we were limiting a little bit too much the flow of inventory not allowing our warehouse managers to really have something to play with and generate sales so that’s a little bit of the approach we believe it’s the right investment yes we do realize it is higher than last year but i think it is the right investment and the good thing is a lot of that is  most of it is just safe inventory with not necessarily a stamp of seasonal that will cause later on a markdown ronald ronald bookbinder okay and lastly you announced the new store in the dr this morning and you’re constructing the store in costa rica is there a movement away from the colombian focus given the difficulties that you’ve faced there jose luis laparte no not at all its just i guess we announced them as they come out and when we’ve projects in i guess in the pipeline in different country these were about two obviously costa rica came a few months ago and this one just came as of june the one in dr but that doesn’t mean we’re discouraged or anything like that with colombia its just the speed of how things move and the availability of i guess be on snowing in that specific country about it is not an indication at all of moving away from that  from that country or from the growth of opening there ronald bookbinder okay thank you very much and good luck in the new quarter jose luis laparte thank you ronald john heffner thanks ronald operator the next question comes from patricio danziger with rwc please go ahead unidentified analyst hi i wanted to ask a question on margins again these people are okay i see that operating margins were one of the lowest in the history of the company and profit margin was so very low year comparing it versus q  but that was also very indiscernible number just wanted to understand a little bit if you plan to go back to quarters like the second quarter or the first quarter or the q in general thank you jose luis laparte i think q in comparison with the other two quarters came a little below that was more a result of activities there is always some activity cleaning up inventories even though it wasn’t a big shift in margins because we didn’t have that much to have markdowns q for the most part of having a little bit more of markdowns so they were not necessarily obviously as aggressive as they were last year i would say that going forward we will probably be more close to what we’ve made in q again q and q happened to be a little on the higher side and we are not necessarily looking at increasing margins its just the way obviously with colombia the big shift is coming out of colombia where compared to last year we have seen improvements in every single quarter the rest of the markets is just a business as usual sometimes we get a little bit of pressure i should add on competition because there are key items but sometimes that will become more competitive and you had a little bit more of pressure you have wholesale business ongoing in  sometimes in one quarter having another quarter so there are variables there that may drive the margins a little below the other aspect but the recent any other factor that we foresee and john you were … john heffner yes let me just add to that because i think the question also was really into operating margins not just gross margins and well there is a seasonality to our operating margins as a percent of sales q being our highest because of the high level of sales we get in december and so that allows is a seasonal shift from q to q i think one of the things that was impacting us in this third quarter which i think we addressed a little bit is the  two of our four largest markets cost rica and trinidad has seen negative sales and that certainly  that has an impact on our ability to leverage expenses and then expense ratios that we have in those countries which waive on our operating margin percent so i think its a combination of both of this natural seasonal activities from q to q as well as what we’re experiencing with the sales in those two very large markets for us ronald bookbinder thank you this is very helpful operator the next question comes from jon braatz with kansas city capital please go ahead jon braatz good morning john luis i think i know the answer of this question but is there any reason why you … jose luis laparte we will let you answer that answer john jon braatz i did is there any reason to think that if things got more chaotic and venezuela and would there be any impact on your colombia stores and then also with the sort of the financial turmoil and in puerto rico and i know you don’t have stores there but any reason why that  any these sort of outside variables would have any impact on new business and sort of the colombia or the caribbean stores jose luis laparte we actually done  we see that on the time i guess a yearago we started to see and it is still happening we have a lot of accounts in panama more than in colombia we get a lot of those in panama people that grow on and do big shopping a yearago venezuela and that’s really are moving a lot of them are moving to panama or its our impression that are moving there they sign up they renew yearafteryear so we had a good percentage of members that are actually from venezuela in our panama market and also some of them in aruba aruba has the  i guess more a convenient shopping experience a lot of venezuelans used to fly there to buy stuff because they didn’t have much venezuela or he couldn’t have it over there and then they will take it and resell it or just to get dollars so there is a lot going on especially more than in colombia i would say we see a little bit in barranquilla but more than anything we get it in the other countries not panama and to some degree aruba which is a small island but still they get a lot of visitors its in very good proximity to venezuela so we see that will that get better i don’t know its  i don’t know i know things are not getting a lot better in venezuela so i don’t know if that will have a better  more a positive impact on us its hard to tell but we get that on the time jon braatz okay what about puerto rico anything to think about there jose luis laparte you know we havent experienced anything we have to look into our things obviously puerto rico has the other two clubs costco and sams so i don’t know if we will get much of that business or any of that or impact in our proximity area not to  i don’t think and i guess in the last   years i have been here i don’t recall any benefit out of the puerto rico activity not  i know they’re having the difficulties right now jon braatz okay costa rica obviously there is some economic difficulties there anything the government is doing there to stimulate the economy maybe get things better and improve the situation what are the sort of your outlook for the costa rica economy over  lets say over the next year do you see some things improving or sort of continuing as things are jose luis laparte i think that we are going to see a little bit of improvement that will come from a year that hasnt been that great for the costa rica markets so we definitely have a lower base to compete with starting q next year and even in june we’ve  we saw a little bit of improvement there is a lot going on i don’t think that from the government perspective we see these declining i hope we can continue getting some growth we were also  we also did some changes i guess internally to make sure we attack that market a little better so i think we are wellpositioned to keep looking at  to turnaround that market for us and with the opening of the new club obviously we are very optimistic that we can make that happen so as whatever reason under our control we think we will be wellpositioned to have a good end of quarter and a good start for the fiscal year  a lot going on in costa rica and even though again some challenges in the economy in general we had a tough month i think it was  month ago where currency actually went that a little in the high side almost hitting  pesos to  cop to a  so it didn’t help but its now kind of stabilized jon braatz okay one last question the issues maybe in trinidad and  trinidad is  are easing a little bit but in the past calls you’ve talked a little bit about what the currency is for in the black market is it still trading at a discount in the blackmarket versus the stated rate so to speak john heffner yes it is jon there is still a premium that if you wanted to  that you could buy us dollars at a premium out in the black market but its small quantities you certainly couldn’t  that’s not something we would want to engage so we’ve  from time to time we are offered through  reputable sources offers of currency hard currency to euros or us dollars at a bit of a premium and in some case we’ve taken advantage that we felt like its in the range but black market is even beyond that jon braatz yes well so relative to maybe where you were six months ago are you less concerned that there might be a devaluation in trinidad john heffner we reduced substantially our exposure to any devaluation that might occur jon braatz yes john heffner so well i cant predict whether one will occur or not we have taken actions such that our exposures are pretty minimal now compared to where they were back in november jon braatz i think its only at k or something like that so okay thanks john john heffner okay operator the next question comes from victor cardenas with scotiabank please go ahead victor cardenas thank you very much thank you jose luis for taking my question and john as well my question for you is in regards to in view of the quarterly results and the yearoveryear improvements if you could give me some color as to help me understand why the stock price has negatively reacted that significantly jose luis laparte oh i’m really going to have john for the … john heffner some great insight victor cardenas yes john heffner i don’t know victor i mean the  we don’t provide guidance to the street and therefore the  i’m not sure what the basis for those projections or what our results might have been for the quarter or could have been so i really have no comment on movement of the stock as a result of any public announcement that we make jose luis laparte yes i will only add that obviously we run the business a quarterbyquarter and looking at just keeping  obviously looking at making improvements and regardless of however the market reacts i think we are running good things we have a lot going on in the company we are happy with the results and they would be better for sure but i think we’re going to put a lot of good things for having a good end of quarter and hopefully the market will react to that again its a tough one to give you the right answer i think internally we just keep looking at how can we do better regardless of whatever the market really does so i think again we’re running a good company and hopefully we’re pretty excited about  with two new clubs so a lot going on in the company that should make us feel good anyway victor cardenas much appreciate thank you jose luis and john and good luck in the next quarter jose luis laparte thank you operator the next question comes from thomas vester with lgm investments please go ahead thomas vester hi jose luis and john i have a bunch of questions just let me know how many i can ask but the first one will be in colombia i mean clearly as you point out the margin is trending up again and now you know possible in the bottom line in colombia but can you  do you have any view on where the margin will go to because clearly there are much differentials in your markets and clearly also in colombia you maybe have a slightly more expense structure with a specifically expensive lease in bogota but i mean caribbean is low margin structurally than central america but can you just share a little bit of insights what a sustainable margin should be in colombia and any view on when that will be reached i mean clearly probably that comment will depend on assuming a stable currency that will be great jose luis laparte yes obviously when we  its been a tough ride as you know for the last couple of years in colombia and that we made a point this year given that we had some currency stabilization that we were  we have the opportunity obviously to consolidate our business there get the members confidence and i think we’ve been successful on that site for the most part with getting obviously good renewals we were able to increase our membership fee we were able to little by little get our margins more adjusted we still think it will probably take a little longer to get to the margins maybe more like central america that cost structure is more similar to central america versus the cost structure of the caribbean markets so we see that happening but it will probably take another  a couple of years to get there competition is strong in colombia we don’t have a straight club competition but obviously we have a lot of respect for the retailers over there the big retailers and obviously we’re still relatively a small still for  in comparison with the other guys i think everything is going on the right direction to position us well to continue growing and i think we’re going to take it very carefully in terms of trying to reach the same level of margins that we in the colombian market i mean in the central america or the caribbean markets we want to get there eventually that’s kind of the way we compare all the countries but obviously individually each country at the same time have something that we need to make sure we stay competitive on that specific market that we have room to get those  the margins that we need it varies by categories the mix of sales obviously in colombia slightly will be different compared to other markets so everything place in the equation of getting to the margins we want so i hope that answers your question thomas vester yes and but you’re still expecting the margin to continue to trend up or do you expect it to level out here jose luis laparte we still expect markets to  i think it will level up thomas vester so the margin in this quarter in colombia should sort of be the base for the coming quarters jose luis laparte yes more likely i think we’re getting there obviously we saw that  basis points improvement but i think we’re getting there thomas vester okay great and then just on the warehouse this is probably you john on and i think i asked it last time as well but i understand some of the cost with the move and on the early lease termination costs etcetera but shouldn’t we start the season cost savings as well from not having those rental expenses and one would guess that owning it would be better for gross margin going forward since you’re taking the capex john heffner yes its over time it will thomas in the nearterm though we vacated space that were still on the hook to provide the lease cover for us so we are and while we are  we are taking that efforts to sublet that space we do have some  we are paying rent on the vacated space in the nearterm however i think we certainly recognize that we made the decision to go to the new  to acquire the new dc and despite what we believe are going to be some shortterm risk that we had to overcome to offload some of that costs the longterm benefits both operationally and strategically of the new dc more than outweighed that risk so lot of activity in that area but in the shortterm i think we’re going to continue to have some excess space that we vacated that will pay some lease on thomas vester okay and then just next can you say anything i mean its clearly much appreciated that  is looking to be an year with two new clubs coming from being slightly more lean on the new club additions in the last  months after the big expansion in colombia but can you share any color on the pipeline and how comfortable you’re and if you’re looking at anyways to speed it up without sacrificing the quality of your offering jose luis laparte i’m not sure we can give you a lot more color all i will say is that that we have projects in the pipeline thomas that we are optimistic that we will be able to little by little start i guess revealing that the projects that come in the pipeline we’re obviously doing our best to try to technical difficulty it is difficult in every single market more than anything that permit  the permitting process is slow and we were just learning how to be patient obviously doing the right things as a company so i’m not sure we can give you a lot more but i can assure you that definitely we want to keep finding a way to add more clubs this year fiscal  happen to be one that we will be adding two which is so far hopefully we may be able to squeeze something else maybe in the calendar year  but things are looking good so we feel pretty optimistic that we will be announcing something soon thomas vester great and just on new markets i don’t know if you can answer this question but i mean clearly there is many more markets around you that looks interesting from a club penetration perspective i mean peru has been talked about as one that looks interesting can you say if you’re actually looking to secure land in any new markets outside in your existing territory or are you just considering new markets i mean so i guess i’m asking if you can share if you actually looking to acquire land and its just that has been holding up or you’re not at that stage for any new markets jose luis laparte we are not at that stage of looking for land we always try to be aware of whats going on in the markets peru the one that you mentioned chile a few markets that were kind of familiar with to some degree familiar with the market but not ready to be making any announcement on a new country yet i think we kind of  i think we feel responsible to be aware of what’s going on what’s the opportunity out there for us and try to figure out  we can figure something as far as the strategy for those markets but nothing on that really active role right now with those markets thomas thomas vester great and just two more then i promise to stop … jose luis laparte quite a long list jose luis laparte … yes on ecommerce much appreciated your sharing jose luis in the beginning i mean we’ve been doing a lot of thinking about how the  i mean clearly also looking at what costco is doing because one could argue there is some structural difficulty in for club retailers to go online given the membership structure but what i hear you say is that that your online strategy would be focused or centered around that its own members is that correct jose luis laparte yes definitely whatever we do in terms of online it would be different to the way the clubs to clubs you got to have a membership and some people think its crazy not to allow everyone to shop but we know that that works and obviously costco and sams do the same thing in the states so whatever we do is going to actually be with the number of accounts  million accounts that we have more than  million cards i guess if you put the additional cards sold our potential is as much as  million cards out there that can be not only shopping in a brickandmortar but eventually integrate the online experience and have that successful experience what everybody calls now the omnichannel it doesn’t matter where you shop you can shop brickandmortar and shop on your own whatever you shop but it will be definitely to our members thomas vester yes okay understood and then the last question i mean i guess just following on the question from scotia i mean you are coming out of a significant category cycle with the need you had for the ramp up in colombia and now the big expensive in miami but given the very cash generative nature of your business youre still net cash and i guess with the current cash generation you can easily internally finance three or four clubs a year if that should be needed with the current level you kept for qualities and the dividend and on top of that it seems from what you’re saying john that the liquidity tie up in trinidad is getting a bit better so i guess my question is is the level of the share price where it makes sense for pricesmart and specifically for its shareholders that you start buying back shares john heffner i think that that’s something we’re considering certainly so i really couldn’t comment on that at this point thomas thomas vester okay thanks a lot jose luis laparte thank you thomas operator operator instructions the next question comes from greg halter with indiscernible please go ahead jose luis laparte hello greg operator mr halter your line is open unidentified analyst yes sorry just curious about the online strategy and obviously being in the state here there is lots of concern over amazon and other online players they being the largest just wonder how you view that threat and just wonder if you could elaborate a little more on what your plans are to stem that if you will and how big of an issue is it in the countries you serve versus what we see in the us jose luis laparte well as i mentioned at the beginning in our country it is still obviously  there is no presence per se of i guess a competitor like amazon although people can shop  currently anybody in a country can shop obviously not on the amazon i guess any site in the state and for the most part they choose postal offices and they can get some goods usually its smaller goods if you want to buy bigger stuff its just a challenge because the price and the delivery will kill you so its a little bit harder right now for our market but they have the ability to do some of that shopping now with that said obviously the level of online activity is not as big as it is not even close to what it is in the state but we see that trend changing and that’s why we  i mentioned at the beginning that the strategy that we were not giving up on having a good strategy to serve the needs of the online shopping and obviously we believe we have the strength obviously given that we know  have the distribution network we know the market we have these base of members we know what they shop so its a matter of organizing all those things that we know about our market and try to get the online experience mixed with our brickandmortar that is still successful part of the business as it is in the markets in the states where we see the component of brickandmortar being important so i don’t know if i can give you more details on the strategy we are working on investing on doing something we believe there is a need to invest in technology to investing things that will make that online experience better for the members and that’s where we’re heading right now we don’t want to wait to see if this becomes more important in our country it is going to be probably may take a little longer we don’t know if its going to be to  or  years or  years but its  i think all retail is moving on that direction and we just want to be ready unidentified analyst okay thank you for that and one other quick one what do you do currently regarding cybersecurity given all the threats and issues and i guess there are more than threats these days going on out there across the world jose luis laparte well we have a pretty strong  every  probably every board meeting we have discussions on cybersecurity and recently actually we met  we had a special meeting to  with the people that give us all the advices and the team that works on cybersecurity and we feel we have a pretty secure network we do take care of the member information that we have although we don’t carry a lot of different from other competitors we don’t have in our files or in our  i guess in our database credit card information and things like that as other companies do but still we do have a very strong things going on in terms of cybersecurity we just want to be ready for whatever that is that may happen you never know what can happen fortunately we havent had any issues in our company and we think we have a good plan right now on going forward that’s something we keep reviewing and trying to update every as things change or evolve in that market unidentified analyst okay thank you jose luis laparte thank you greg operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the

today we finished the second quarter of our fiscal year  with net warehouse sales of  million an increase of  compared to the second quarter last year comparable warehouse sales for the week period ending march   for the  warehouse clubs that have opened at least  months were  with the same week period last year it may look unusual for comp sales to be higher than total sales keep in mind that q last year fiscal  included an extra day sales compared to this quarter due to the leap year  days in total compared to  days in this quarter  in the quarter this year adjusting for that additional day last year we estimate that total sales growth will have been  comp sales are measured in equivalent fiscal weeks from period to period as reported net income for the quarter was  million or  per share compared to  million or  per share a yearago similar to the events of the  on the first quarter this quarters net income reflects an overall improvement in the financial results of colombia good margin performance in many of our other countries and a lower effective tax rate although sales growth in a number of our noncolombia countries was flat or slightly negative looking at sales by segment warehouse sales in our central america segment were down  to  million largely as a result of  of result of costa rica experiencing an increase of  panama guatemala and honduras reported positive growth in warehouse sales and el salvador and nicaragua were slightly down the caribbean had a sales decline of  when compared to the second quarter of last year trinidad our largest market in the segment was down  reflecting the current difficult economic conditions and to some degree also the fact that we limited shipments during that period while we initially thought that the actions we took in november will have an impact of  million to  million sales on sales  million to  million on sales i now think that the impact was far less than that usvi and jamaica recorded sales increases in this region and dr barbados and aruba also had negative sales growth regarding trinidad as a result of the efforts of our incountry and corporate teams to source tradable currencies we’ve lifted all restrictions of  on shipments of us product to trinidad we are hopeful that we can continue to find an adequate level of foreign exchange to return to what appears to be a slowly improving situation in that country without interrupting again our supply of us merchandise colombia had a very strong quarter as i mentioned in the first quarter the exchange rate between the us dollar and the colombian peso has stabilized over the past few quarters which have had a beneficial impact on our business sales membership and margin our total net warehouse sales growth in the quarter was  which includes the addition of our new warehouse club in chia that opened on september  and the beneficial effect of a stronger currency the average exchange rate for the current threemonth period was slightly below  pesos to the dollar compared to last years average of  pesos to the dollar for the second quarter on a local currency basis sales grew  our week comp growth was  which was affected by the cannibalization to our salitre club in the city of bogota that transferred business to the new location in chia a municipality in the northern suburb of bogota in local currency the comp growth was  in a few minutes i will cover more details on our colombia business warehouse margins in the quarter were  compared to  a yearago an increase of  basis points warehouse margins in colombia increased  basis points from the second quarter of last year while gross margins in colombia are still below what we see in our more established markets this year this yearonyear increase in margins in colombia reflects the improving conditions we are seeing there the colombia result alone contributed  basis points to the overall companys gross profit margin increase of  basis points the rest of the difference in margin improvement is a result of less markdowns given as a  given a positive sellthrough of seasonal merchandise purchased for the holiday  an early month of calendar year  in membership we finished the quarter with more than  million accounts up  from a yearago and membership income was up  the month renewal rate at the end of february was  showing an improvement from the month period ending february  that finished at  largely related to the improving renewal rates in colombia if we exclude colombia the renewal capture rate was  compared to  a yearago in the noncolombia markets too at the beginning of february we raised our membership fee in colombia an increase of  pesos in local currency about  we’ve not seen any negative impact on new sign ups or the steadily improving trends in our renewals resulting from that increase and we see these as an evidence that with the stabilizing currency and our efforts in merchandising and operations the members are also increasingly seeing the value that our membership provides to put this in perspective at the end of fiscal year  our colombia month renewal rate was only  operating income for the quarter was  million compared to  million in q of last year colombia achieved a positive operating income of  million compared to a loss of  million for the same quarter a yearago a few additional comments also on colombia performance our chia club opened in september  which opened in september  continues growing on the membership base and renewing accounts from our first bogota club given the convenient store members that live in the north part of the city as i mentioned in my initial comments we believe that our members and all consumers in general are more adapted to the new currency level of approximately  pesos per dollar the fact that we have seen that stability for more than six months gives us also the ability to improve our prices in all our imported merchandise and also keep the exchanges on prices compared to the last two years while it was hard to keep up with the currency variations our buying team in colombia keeps working on developing local items for that market and they have even developed a few privatelabel items developed specifically for that market and with a potential for exporting it to other markets in our region we keep seeing transaction increase in our colombia club and also in our average transaction in both us dollars and also in local currency even with the improvements that we’ve in margin compared to last year we’re not losing focus on offering our members great values and exciting items to improve our membership concept in that country and allow members to realize that with a few purchases they can pay for the price of the year now  pesos membership let me highlight a few other items associated with the quarter before i address our march sales results which we also released yesterday we are happy that we were able to announce the acquisition of land in santa ana costa rica where we will construct our seven warehouse clubs in that country it took a long time for us to reach that point of having all the necessary permits for this site and construction is underway we are planning to open it during the first quarter of our fiscal year  hopefully sometime in late september or early october  unfortunately im not in a position to announce any additional warehouse clubs at this time although our efforts on a number of possible sites continue during the quarter we completed also the acquisition of our new miami dc and in the last two weeks we have moved our miami distribution center  miami dry distribution center to that new location this new facility of about  square feet is located about one mile from our existing location our new stateoftheart facility have efficiencies compared to our old operation clear height of  feet more than  dock doors on a real cross dock layout and approximately  on property container staging positions we also moved our administrative offices that were in the old facility we are very excited about the prospects of this new facility further enabling our distribution operation effectiveness and supporting our companys continued growth for many years to come one last item on warehouse sales in q we have been experiencing no sales grow in two markets where we have a solid and longtime presence and a loyal member base costa rica and dominican republic both of these countries recorded a decrease on comp sales for the second quarter while i recognize that there are challenges related to large amount of sales volumes in some of these clubs and the traffic congestion in these cities around our clubs we nevertheless believe that we should be experiencing sales growth in these established markets as such we are working in these two markets to change those sales trends during the last two quarters of this fiscal year in march we started to see some positive signs which has continued in the first days of april now march sales the total sales for the month of march were  million an increase of  from march last year for the four weeks ended april   comparable warehouse sales for the  clubs was  easter or semana santa was in march last year and will be in april this year it is unclear how that may affect  may have affected the march comparison as we generally experienced increased sales in the lead up to on the first few days of semana santa but then our warehouse clubs are clubs on good friday and many of them are closed on easter sunday and even some on easter monday we think that there might have been a small positive impact in march of this year because of those closures last year and will have that small opposite effect this month of april however we believe that we’re well positioned for a strong sales during the coming weekend and semana santa which many offset some of the effect of the closed days we will experience later this month in fact we often view these months to negate any seasonal shift impact and to better assess the true comp trend with that i will turn things over to john heffner before we take your questions thank you john heffner thank you jose luis let me cover a few additional items total sga expenses increased  basis points in the quarter as a percent of sales similar to what we saw in the first quarter low or negative comp growth resulted in higher warehouse club operations expense ratios in places like costa rica el salvador the dominican republic and trinidad along with additional corporate ga expenses we had interest income of  compared to  last year we’ve cash on deposit in certain countries particularly trinidad which is allowing us to get some additional income this was offset by a  of additional interest expense compared to a year ago as we took on  million of debt in conjunction with the acquisition of the miami distribution center in the quarter foreign exchange transactions and the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities resulted in a  currency gain in the quarter compared to a  loss in q last year we generally saw devaluing currency movements across most of our countries during the quarter but resulted in currency gains in those countries that had net us dollar asset positions like costa rica and the dominican republic in addition despite higher transaction costs for converting tt dollars trinidad dollars into us dollars we took that additional cost into consideration in our pricing model resulting in an overall net currency gain the relative stability of the colombian currency also provided a small gain in the quarter the effective tax rate for the period was  compared to  last year this beneficial change what again largely attributable to the intercompany transactions between pricesmart inc the us entity and pricesmart colombia related to our ongoing market development efforts in colombia we continue to expect to see a benefit of the effect  to the effective tax rate of approximately  to  basis points in the upcoming quarter from a balance sheet perspective the company ended the second quarter with cash of a  million an increase of  million during the quarter some of the larger actions impacting cash in q included the payment of a  per share dividend on february  the purchase of land in costa rica and the acquisition of the new distribution center in miami offset with the addition of debt we added to finance the dc as jose luis mentioned we’ve now moved much of our noncore dc operations from our current facility to the new dc we have agreements in place for subletting most of the vacated space in the old location however we will likely recognize a lease liability charge of approximately  in the third quarter associated with a difference in cash flows over the remainder of our lease term with that jose luis and i will be happy to take your questions laura i will turn things over to you questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question will come from dave king of roth capital partners david king thanks good morning guys jose luis laparte good morning dave john heffner good morning david king in terms of trinidad it looks like the lower shipments there was  the impact from that was a little bit less than the  million to  million i think you were originally anticipating i think the market was down  or so in the quarter i guess how much do you think that the lower shipments weighed and then with the sourcing of tradable currencies having improved a little bit recently how should we be thinking about that impact as we move forward jose luis laparte okay dave good morning i think we  although we have to tell and we keep looking at different ways of trying to measure how much the fact that we reduced shipments impacted sales we think it probably impacted less than we expected although obviously we did at the high season i guess at the middle of our holiday season so for sure there was something that we lost on the sales fortunately we believe that were now  we believe completely that we’re now back in our regular mode of shipping merchandise and we shouldn’t see any more effects obviously we’re also  our corporate team and our local team has been doing as i mentioned a good job in getting more currency i guess on trading more of our tt dollars to either us dollars or euro and we think that in general things improving on those both sides either from the shipment perspective or from the trading currency perspective we do recognize that the economy is still a little bit soft but we’re more optimistic at this point to anniversary the vat increases that we have last year obviously little by little things are getting better in the economy and we should start seeing something that  to some degree improving in the country david king okay that’s great color thanks jose luis and then in terms of gross margin improvement i guess yearonyear it was about  basis points or so john any sense on how much of that improvement was attributable to currency versus i think last year we had a fair amount of markdowns if i remember both in the quarter you just reported but i wanted to say also in the quarter you’re in now and in the yearago period how should we be thinking about that moving forward and what was sort of the impact in the quarter thanks jose luis laparte i will take that one again dave i think definitely the  last year yes for sure we have a difficult quarter a lot of that was related also to colombia with all the currency changes and the fact that we have to do a lot of markdowns there and in other markets i think q this year had a much better performance just because obviously colombia helped definitely and we’re making a lot of improvement there in margin and i think we have a cleaner inventory we had a good holiday sellthrough we have good early start for spring this year we are now at the middle of cleaning off our inventory for whatever happens and whatever  any inventory we need after our easter period but we are very  we don’t expect to see big changes or swings in our margin in q i think we are going to be basically on  within our plan and we think we’re in good position to close obviously q and q not any items that would be different to report and hopefully the stability of the currencies will continue in most of the countries which helps us obviously keep that  keep our prices i guess sharp and definitely just have a good sellthrough david king okay that’s helpful and encouraging and then maybe one more and i will step back in terms of the  so i appreciate the color on the response to the membership increase in colombia just also thoughts around maybe doing the platinum membership taking at some other markets i guess what are sort of some of the highlevel thoughts around the potential there what kind of  sort of markets would it make sense would it make sense across all the markets what are you thinking about  on that front jose luis laparte we are actually getting ready for maybe  a couple of countries to relaunch it in a couple of countries we are basically working on some changes in our pointofsale system and we’re happy with what we have seen in costa rica and i believe by the next quarter for the next call we will probably be announcing in which countries we will be doing our rollout of these we are not looking at doing it right now in colombia per se obviously we are taking various steps there i think we were happy to see that the increase in membership which we needed because obviously we have that conversion we were way below our goal of indiscernible of  that we have in the other countries so again with the increase we’re still below but it was a good first step to get our members i guess into a higher membership and as i reported it was pretty much transparent i think we will continue reinforcing our value proposition there making sure that members understand obviously the membership concept which so far seems that they’re getting there and then eventually we may consider platinum even in a market like that one but at this point it is not on the list of the market q  david king okay thanks so much for taking my questions good luck with the rest of the year jose luis laparte thank you dave john heffner thank you dave operator and our next question will come from ronald bookbinder of coker palmer ronald bookbinder good morning and nice job on the continuing improving comps on the new distribution center in miami was there any extra cost during the quarter as you bought that in january and the quarter until february john heffner i guess the only addition to the cost we have was the additional interest expense because we closed on the loan during the quarter so it would be that small increase in interest expense would have probably been the only thing i could  we could really attribute to that ronald bookbinder okay and on costa rica its great that youre seeing some improvement now in march there but is it just traffic in the area or what was causing the weakness and what are you doing differently now to see improvement jose luis laparte i would say there was an issue specifically in q with some biggest i guess traffic issues there was a  they closed like a bridge that communicates a big portion of the city with the other one so that cause a little bit of disruption no question we don’t expect only to blaming on those kind of events although we recognize that it was harder to get to our location but i also think in general one of the things we are basically making sure we do is that i think we probably had a little bit of a slowdown in exciting items in q and q and then we want to make sure that going forward we don’t lose that  the ability to keep shipping obviously good merchandise and i think that’s what our business is about so at the end of the day we believe that improving in some areas of merchandising should help us get back to where we need to be in a market that is  we have such a loyal member base and so important for us especially now that we’re getting ready with our seventh warehouse in that market so i don’t think it is anything that we cant change and again we’re pretty optimistic with the initial results even in just a few days in this month of april so i think we can get that back and recover some of that lost ground very easily ronald ronald bookbinder and in colombia in local currency the average ticket was up  or over  what are you offering there thats different are they just buying more of items that you have or have you added new items that is getting excitement going there too jose luis laparte we have been adding a lot of items in the last year and half there has been special effort in colombia and obviously looking at local production and i think obviously some items take a little longer but little by little we’re getting those extra items in the club and i think its just a result of i guess we’re getting a lot of those new items already in the members mark baskets and that will continue to be our trend going forward just keep adding some items i remember seeing last week a few reports on our recently launched coffee under our privatelabel so a great item that just landed in the clubs in colombia under our privatelabel and like that we have many examples of items that are making our selection better and obviously also the us inputs slowing that destabilized currency are helping obviously improve our stake in both local and us its all about items at the end ronald ronald bookbinder and lastly in the us everybody has been talking about the shift to ecommerce you guys have an ecommerce program for colombia but what are your plans looking longterm as moving further into ecommerce jose luis laparte well we’ve a couple of things on the works the first one is we’re going to replace our platform we’re going to relaunch our platform very soon its been taking a little longer than we expected because it’s a more robust platform that will help to support the operation that we’re doing in colombia which actually members can buy merchandise that we sell in the clubs that something we’re going to launch hopefully by the end of q in all our countries and that’s the first step of having a better platform that can support that and in addition we are reviewing our strategy in our whole ecommerce we do believe there is opportunity to do it a lot better we don’t  i mean we’re looking at what is going on in the  specifically in the us markets and the trends that is growing and we definitely want to be part of that as it keeps getting into our countries it is not as important yet and obviously we’re in some smaller market but we do recognize that retail is changing and we’ve got to be ready for i guess attacking that and competing with other players now we don’t have right now big players i guess in this ecommerce arena but i mean things are changing and indiscernible we will try to do our best on getting that business also i’m learning as everybody is learning in this environment but we’re getting there from it ronald bookbinder okay thank you and good luck going forward jose luis laparte thank you john heffner thanks ron operator and next we have a question from patricio danziger of rwc patricio danziger hi thank you for taking my questions just wanted to understand store openings in the last years you’ve been opening three stores per year approximately and now the pace have stopped what is the main reason for these and do you think you can accelerate that to something around three four stores per year jose luis laparte okay patricio we don’t have  i guess we happen to be opening i guess three four in average in the last couple of years obviously with colombia that added a few and we don’t necessarily have a goal of three per year unfortunately the permit processing the permits process has been a lot slower and that’s the main reason we havent been able to announce more openings as i mentioned in my initial comments we do have a couple of projects i guess on the works for that effort and hopefully we will be announcing some of them soon it is more out of our control at this point its not specific that we’ve slowed down any of our plans on openings we do have a pretty good idea of different countries and places or places where we want to open new clubs and we will  we’re pretty optimistic that very soon we can get a little bit more on  in the pipeline patricio danziger great thank you jose luis laparte thank you operator and the next question will come from jon braatz of kansas city capital jon braatz good morning jose john jose luis laparte good morning jon braatz one of my questions was just answered but jose has there been any  when you talk a little bit about the weakness in costa rica and dominican republic has there been any change in sort of the competitive landscape any new players in those markets jose luis laparte not necessarily new players i’d say the only thing that has  in costa rica we would say not necessarily new players i mean things are business as usual i would say i guess its nothing  no one new coming in the market i think its just a little bit of more i guess competition from other guys opening more stores or places in the country and that is actually  its happening more in dr and hopeful in the last few years they’ve been very aggressive in terms of super market competition have got very difficult in that market and obviously they’ve been opening more stores that will probably apply more for the dominican republic that has been definitely showing not necessarily new players but more stores of the current players in different places of the city and that combined with the traffic makes it a little bit harder sometimes for our members to get access to us no but believing in our concept obviously we’re trying to make the changes we need and try to improve and give the members a reason to shop with us and eventually would be also with our ecommerce platform hopefully that they will also be able to shop online we don’t know so we’re trying to get in different  i guess getting different efforts to try to improve the performance in those but that is not necessarily new market players in any of those markets jon braatz okay i guess the same question but for the colombian market any changes in the competitive landscape there jose luis laparte no colombia has been actually  the only change that we’ve seen there there are a couple of new players that started basically at the same time we open there were a few chains that opened these small stores that are competing big time one in indiscernible markets out of portugal they have opened a lot of stores in that market there is also a concept called indiscernible d that has been opened in a lot of small format stores in those markets and i think they’re going after the same business obviously small mom and pop stores but we havent seen any effect to our business i guess those will be the kind of the new competitors the rest of the competitors are pretty much the same ones we’ve seen through the years and i think we’ve been actually learning how to compete with each other i think the big hypermarkets there either exito or jumbo or alkosto all those guys have probably been learning how to compete also with the new guys which is us and i think we’re  nothing has changed i think this is still competitive market for sure but nothing that would be so much different at this point in that market jon jon braatz okay thank you john one question you had mentioned that you expect the tax rate to be   basis points lower when i look at last years third quarter and fourth quarter tax rates they were  and  respectively are you talking about  to  basis points reduction specifically for those  both those quarters or sort of an average or  can you clarify that a little bit john heffner sure yes literally i think i was referring to sort of the run rate as we’re going into the third quarter here in the fourth quarter last year we had a very low tax rate because … jon braatz right john heffner … that was the first quarter we got the impact that  of the intercompany transaction between the us and colombia so we’re sort of comping if you will in the next quarter i guess a period when we didn’t do that so once we get to the fourth quarter we will have anniversaried this issue so the  my comments are specific to the third quarter jon braatz so basically john sort of a lower tax rate in the third quarter yearoveryear but more comparable yearoveryear in the fourth quarter john heffner that’s correct yes jon braatz okay all right thank you operator operator instructions i’m showing no additional questions id like to turn the conference back over to john heffner for any closing remarks john heffner
