chutney our tomato chutney is the perfect condiment for meats especially pork and vegetables think of it as a complex spicy topping somewhere between a sauce and catsup the kick comes primarily from fresh ginger root and garlic note to those with nut allergies our tomato chutney contains slivered almonds pickled onion rings our favorite burger topping mildly spicy and crisp to provide a little crunch and zing to your burgers spicy pickled okra a late summer  fall offering we use small one to two bites okra pods they have an intense and some say addictive flavor strawberry jam when the local strawberries show up at market we make as much of this product as we can and it is never enough our goal is to accent the natural flavor of the fresh berries typically we sell this product in may and are sold out in june blackberry jam we produce this product with fresh blackberries from local growers we make batches withseeds and without this is a jam not a jelly not as thick as a jelly perfect for spooning over pancakes or spreading on toast or a biscuit we love it on pbj sandwiches spicy pickled peaches pickled peaches were once a staple on the southern table and are hard to find these days we make a limited quantity of pickled peaches that are spicy and bursting with flavor these are the perfect side to compliment pork or other meats and are used in many southern recipes peaches in amaretto syrup when the peaches hit the local farmers market we get busy making as many jars of this as we have time to it is never enough and we sell out quickly these peach halves make a delightful finale to a special meal when served over vanilla ice cream or whipped cream watermelon rind pickles if we can find thickrind watermelons late in the summer we offer these crisp and sweet with just a hint of spice old fashioned fig preserves our fig preserves are made from the fruit of our ancient brown turkey fig tree the tree produces a small fig crop in late july  early august from which we make this preserve our fig preserves replicate those common in the early and mid twentieth century the figs are whole or halved and this preserve is accented with ginger and lemon slices these are a perfect topping for a breakfast biscuit or muffin pepper jellies we grow our own jalapeno cayenne and scotch bonnet chiles and create hot pepper jellies that capture the unique flavors of these peppers the cayenne and jalapeno jellies are modestly hot while the scotch bonne jelly is quite a bite we make a limited quantity of extrahot pepper jellies for customers who need even more heat green tomato pickles when green tomatoes start showing up at local farmers markets we make this very labor intensive pickle using a very old recipe these take three days to produce and are made in very limited quantities they are crisp tart spicy and slightly sweet the perfect accompaniment for a special dinner plate this is one of our family’s favorite pickles and it is perfect for special occasions tomato chutney pickled onion rings spicy pickled okra strawberry jam blackberry jam spicy pickled peaches peaches in amaretto syrup watermelon rind pickles old fashioned fig preserves pepper
