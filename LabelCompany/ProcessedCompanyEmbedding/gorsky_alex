brillwhat happened in the previous chapterthe new ceojj press release re gorskys promotionfeb  on february   five weeks after johnson  johnson paid  million to texas and made allen jones a multimillionaire the company announced that the board had appointed alex gorsky to succeed william weldon as the new chief executive officer the press release noted that gorsky had begun at jj in  as a salesman for janssen and then worked his way up to president of the unit although he had left in  to run rival novartis’ north american division he had returned to the fold in  to assume a variety of top positions including vice chairman the announcement quoted weldon the outgoing ceo describing the “rigorous thorough and formal multiyear” board selection processlike all johnson  johnson ceos before him alex gorsky came from within the organizationboard members who appointed gorskyi tried to reach each member of the jj board that chose gorsky to ask how gorsky’s involvement in the risperdal marketing and sales campaigns had factored into his or her decision of the —who include the former president of the university of michigan and five retired fortune  ceos—i was able to reach eight by phone or email either directly or through their designated assistants all declined comment on that question and despite being independent board members technically unaffiliated with the company all referred me to jj’s public relations departmentbut michael johns a board member physician and former chancellor of emory did say “as i understand it risperdal was a drug that treats symptoms of a disease not any disease so maybe it’s the system that’s screwed up” that rationale aligns with how the company’s lawyers according to one of them saw the cases—that the government’s offlabel argument puts the company in an impossible position when it comes to drugs like risperdal “these diseases” the lawyer explained “don’t have a blood test or anything else they are all about symptoms and many different types of people can have those symptoms which our drug does a great job of alleviating”gorsky was described in the wall street journal story covering his promotion as a “former army ranger who had “edged out fellow vice chairman sheri mccoy  for the top spot both inside and outside the company” the journal reported “ms mccoy was thought to have an edge over mr gorsky in the horse race to become the yearold company’s ninth leader”the story’s concluding sentence quoted a health industry consultant saying he “thinks the board chose mr gorsky partly because ‘he has been responsible for the largest acquisition in the history of jj’ the synthes deal”jj synthes press releaseapril  synthes is a large manufacturer of surgical equipment and supplies whose  billion buyout by johnson  johnson was announced in  as gorsky prepared to take over as ceo the deal which he had helped steer was about to closefor aficionados of illegal offlabel sales synthes was a special companysynthes accusationsjune   p in  a pennsylvaniabased subsidiary of synthes was accused by federal prosecutors of illegally marketing and aiding in the misuse of “trauma products to treat damaged human bone” during surgerythe subsidiary called norian and synthes itself were charged with a total of  felonies and  misdemeanors all involving an alleged conspiracy to encourage doctors to conduct unauthorized clinical trials of the company’s products on patients being treated for compression fractures of the spine a painful condition suffered mostly by the elderly“before the marketing program began” federal prosecutors in philadelphia alleged “pilot studies showed the company that the bone cement reacted chemically with human blood in a test tube to cause blood clots the research also showed in a pig that such … clots became lodged in the lungs”the company had not stopped marketing the product “until after a third patient had died on the operating table” the government charged adding that “after the death of the third patient in january  norian and synthes did not recall the bone cement from the market—which would have required them to disclose details of the three deaths to the fda … instead the company compounded their crimes by carrying out a coverup in which they lied to the fda during an official inspection in may and june ”in short according to the government the new jj acquisition had prior to being acquired by jj illegally experimented on humans and killed three of them in the process then lied to the fda about itwhat would become known as the bone cement case would end up with four norian executives pleading guilty and serving five to nine months in prison and synthes agreeing in  to pay a  million fineas followon suits by patients or the heirs of dead patients then worked their way through the courts the case became the subject of a riveting september   story in fortune magazine the most telling item in mina kimes’ report might have been this when johnson  johnson’s purchase of synthes was announced a few months after the highly publicized guilty pleas and fines the johnson  johnson press release kimes wrote cited “synthes’s ‘culture’ and ‘values’ as evidence of its appeal even as former synthes executives awaited sentencing on charges of grievous conduct”tossing gorsky a hand grenadealex gorsky was scheduled to become johnson  johnson’s chief executive on april   fifteen days before an arkansas judge ordered the company to pay  billion for illegal risperdal marketing in his state the verdict would be thrown out two years later by the state supreme court which ruled that the arkansas false claims act did not apply to false statements about prescription drugsbrief re gorsky involvementapril   p but the arkansas case wasn’t the jj lawyers’ top concern that day they were more worried according to one company lawyer about a brief that boston federal prosecutors had just filed with a judge contesting the company’s refusal to make alex gorsky available for a deposition in its civil suit over the risperdalomnicare nursing home casein march the prosecutors handling the omnicare case had sent johnson  johnson’s lawyers a letter matteroffactly asking for dates when gorsky could be deposed the prosecutors knew that they were putting jj and its new boss in a tight spotthese kinds of chess plays are why lawyers on both sides of the highest stakes whitecollar litigation love the gamegorsky’s lawyers could make him available and expose him to a barrage of questions under oath about the omnicare deal and about the alleged offlabel promotion of risperdal to the elderly or they could refuse to make him available by arguing that his testimony was not necessary federal rules give corporations the right to refuse to make a top executive available if the judge believes the purpose of deposing him or her is harassment rather than a quest for real information however arguing that gorsky testimony wasn’t relevant because he did not have direct knowledge opened the door for the government to go to the judge with a brief spelling out of why his testimony was relevant—in other words all the details of his handson involvementthese kinds of chess plays are why lawyers on both sides of the highest stakes white collar litigation love the game the prosecutors who are typically lawyers with elite credentials get to match moves with some of the most highly paid privatesector litigators anywhere like friends engaged in a fierce tennis match there’s a collegiality binding both sidesin fact they often switch sides by now michael loucks who had led the boston office’s drug company investigations had left to become a partner handling corporate securities fraud and white collar criminal defense in the boston office of skadden arps one of the country’s top firmsgorsky and the jj lawyers chose the lesser of the bad choices “mr gorsky had no reasonable connection to the subject matter of the government’s complaint and was not involved in the facts underlying this case” they wrote back on march  explaining why the new ceo shouldn’t have to sit for the depositionthe government responded to this invitation to spell out gorsky’s “reasonable connection” and his “involvement in the facts” underlying the charges that omnicare had already settled its brief to the judge was not made part of the public record but it was there for all the johnson  johnson lawyers and their client to read—a hand grenade whose pin could be pulled with a leak to the press or if it came to that by cutting and pasting much of it into an amended suit naming the bossthe rise of alex gorskythis was the first time any government document had tied alex gorsky to the risperdal scandal it did so in unrelenting detail with each point followed by a reference to a document that the government had obtained through subpoenas to johnson  johnson and janssen“from october  to october  mr gorsky was janssen’s vice president of marketing and from october  to early  he was president of janssen”“during all of that time he was responsible for selling risperdal a drug whose biggest customer was omnicare”“he regularly received monthly reports on jj’s long term care group including reports which commented on omnicare’s efforts to promote prescribing of risperdal and other jj products”“he met repeatedly with senior omnicare executives to discuss those efforts” the meeting dates were then listedas the government’s brief went on the description of gorsky’s involvement got more specific as if the prosecutors meant to tighten the vise on the incoming ceo of the credo company“in advance of the may   meeting with omnicare for example he received information that risperdal’s  market share of omnicare ‘represents omnicare’s ability in persuading physicians to write risperdal in the areas of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia’” this was a quote from a document referenced as an exhibit to the brief“as vice president of marketing and having previously worked closely with jj’s medical development group which was responsible for developing clinical trial data for risperdal he was in a position to know why jj chose not to inform omnicare or members of jansen’s own sales staff that in january  the food  drug administration ‘fda’ had warned jj that marketing risperdal as safe and effective in the elderly would be false and misleading”“likewise he was in a position to know why jj did not disclose to omnicare executives that in  the fda had rejected jj’s attempt to get approval to market risperdal for treatment of psychotic and behavioral disturbances in dementia by far the most prevalent use of risperdal in omnicareserved nursing facilities because of inadequate safety data”“mr gorsky was also involved in approving payments for data to omnicare under the  consulting and services agreement”in short the reason johnson  johnson’s incoming ceo was needed to testify didn’t have to do with his current position it was all about the positions he had held and been promoted from—the positions where he had demonstrated that he had the right stuff to lead the entire company according to the board that had just anointed him it was simply a matter of getting a company marketing manager who happened to have become the ceo to explain his conduct on the way up the ladder“we wanted to deal with everything at once” recalls one johnson  johnson lawyer “just pay and be done with it all and so did the government”it seemed like a strong argument but the government actually didn’t care much about getting gorsky’s deposition this was all part of the chess game which by the early half of  was being played across a national map boston had its risperdalomnicare investigation and philadelphia had its qui tam suits brought by vicki starr and by now four others in a group sheller was leading involving the broader offlabel marketing allegations there was even a smallerbore federal investigation in san francisco related to the marketing of another johnson  johnson product the heart failure drug natrecorboston risperdal omnicare complaintphiladelphia qui tam complaintsan francisco complaint“we wanted to deal with everything at once” recalls one johnson  johnson lawyer “just pay and be done with it all and so did the government”for that reason and because of the stakes and the bigname company involved the justice department in washington was now calling the shots the man in charge was tony west who had been head of the justice department’s civil division but had since been promoted to associate attorney generalassistant attorney general tony west projected a “sense of disgust” at the conduct of drug companies getty imagesalthough west had been a corporate lawyer in san francisco one line in his resume suggested that he was a bit more of a free spirit than other colleagues who rotate from corporate defense practices to the government and back again in the aftermath of the september  attacks while working at his san francisco firm he had vigorously defended pro bono john walker lindh the alleged “american taliban” who had been captured and tortured by american soldiers in afghanistan in fact west’s work for lindh which included charging the justice department with a variety of abuses had almost sidetracked his senate confirmation when president obama appointed him to the justice department in “tony was determined to make a mark with these drug cases” says one defense lawyer “he really projected a sense of disgust with the whole thing”west allowed the talks in philadelphia to proceed that was the place where the offenses likely to yield the most money through the qui tam false claims were being negotiated but he kept close tabs on their progress and made it clear that he would be involved in the final dealnegotiations between the two sides in philadelphia which had begun in  had proceeded into spring  according to what had become something of a standard script it was a script that had been followed in deals for offlabel offenses that had been completed with west signing off in philadelphia with eli lilly in  astrazeneca in  and novartis also in  and in boston with pfizer in  and merck in  in fact for the drug companies it was sometimes the same lawyers representing different clients who were called in to lead the negotiations“we knew how this was going to be played” recalls a defense lawyer who had been involved in one of those earlier deals and who was also involved in the jj negotiations “we also knew that these guys had a habit of wanting to raise the bar so that if lilly had paid  million and the guys they competed with in the boston office had gotten  billion from pfizer although that involved allegations of four illegally marketed drugs they were going to come after us hard”as was generally true in those cases initially the lawyers for the drug companies—one or two partners and a few lowerlevel associates each from as many as three different law firms hired by the company—would troop into a conference room at the prosecutor’s office and protest to philadelphia us attorney zane memeger’s assistants that their client had done nothing wrong the meeting might last an hour or two during which the government would flash hints of its evidence and the defense lawyers would say something about how flimsy it all soundedthe defense lawyers’ bills at hourly rates of  to  totaled  to  thousand dollars an hoursometimes memeger would drop in to ask how things were going it would all be friendlymemeger an affable lawyer with a sterling resume was part of the club he had won awards as a government prosecutor before becoming a partner and white collar crime specialist at one of philadelphia’s largest corporate firms he had then been appointed us attorney by obama in  allowing him to catch the tail end of the office’s high profile drug casesmonths would go by as the government continued to examine documents and talk to witnesses including some who would be put before a grand jury because this was proceeding as a criminal case as well as a civil case potentially involving damages for false claimsthen the defense lawyers would return and allow as how maybe some salespeople had gone off the reservation and done things they shouldn’t have done the prosecutors would chuckle or feign outrage and talk vaguely or not so vaguely if the other side had managed to tempt them about the evidence showing that higherups were involved and that this was all part of a company plan charlene fullmer one of the assistant us attorneys leading the investigation would occasionally mention an especially bad piece of evidence according to one lawyer one of her favorites was the fact that an entire risperdal eldercare sales unit had been set up“there were innumerable meetings” memeger recalls “they’d present we’d present eventually we would narrow the issues”holding no one responsibleactually the issues were only one issue moneyboth sides had long since agreed in principle on a single misdemeanor criminal plea by the corporation—not by any individualthe only question was how much all of this was going to cost johnson  johnson in civil damages and criminal finestechnically the amount of the civil penalties was supposed to be calibrated to the amount of actual false claims—the amount paid by medicare veterans or others receiving federal health benefits resulting from the impermissible offlabel selling “we’d come in with economic analyses showing it was fifty or a hundred or two hundred million or whatever but we knew they’d ignore that” says one of the drug company negotiators “they’d counter with three billion or something maybe five but they would never really tell us how they got there because they had no idea for them it was easy”there was also the question of how the money would be split between a civil damages payment for those false claims and a criminal fine for the misdemeanor in most situations civil payments are tax deductible criminal fines are not at a corporate tax rate of roughly  percent that was a big difference a lawyer who can move  million from the fine column to the civil column saves his client  million making his  hourly rate negligiblemeantime according to another lawyer the johnson  johnson executives gorsky included were of two minds they wanted to put this behind them and the money however off the charts by any rational standard would not hurt the company’s financials too much or its standing on wall street in fact settling for almost any amount would help on wall street by resolving uncertainty on the other hand says this lawyer “they were angry about the charges because they thought they had a first amendment right to sell products that they believed in and they knew they were a good company”that single misdemeanor plea was also a standard part of the script it was the deal all the big companies had made in their offlabel cases and according to lawyers on both sides nothing different was ever contemplated by either side in this case this was despite the fact that the prosecutors in the negotiations with defense lawyers argued that the drug johnson  johnson sold was particularly powerful and that the offlabel use was intended for the most vulnerable patients the elderly and children‘what can you prove to a jury’misbranding definition misdemeanor and felony penaltiesp  an individual is guilty of a misdemeanor technically known as misbranding if he or she causes an fdaapproved drug to be put into interstate commerce with the intention of having it be sold offlabel with all of the business plans and marketing campaigns targeted at children and the elderly that could be linked to gorsky that was something for which the prosecutors seemed to have convincing evidencethe same offense is a felony if it is done with the intent to defraud that’s a harder case to prove when it comes to the janssen executives such as gorsky although prosecutors might have been able to argue that this happened with the promotions to the elderly especially through omnicare and with the company’s repeated efforts to get approval from the fda to market to children at the same time that they were actually marketing to children“it’s really a matter of the quality of the evidence you have and what you think you can prove to a jury” memeger told me when asked about why no effort was made to name individuals“the statute of limitations also comes into play” he added referring to a federal criminal law that generally does not allow prosecutions to be initiated more than five years after the crime was allegedly committed had the government’s investigation not dragged out over so many years that would not have been an issue given that the prosecutors had begun their investigations in  and the company’s allegedly illegal marketing had continued at least through  and it would not have been an issue at all if the fda had been monitoring the same prescription data that drug companies routinely purchase and if it had seen that within a year of risperdal’s launch a high percentage of prescriptions were being written by doctors such as pediatricians and those working at nursing homes who treated patients in the prohibited marketshowever as soon as the government and johnson  johnson began talks the government asked that the company waive its statute of limitation protections for the corporation—in effect freezing the date for any criminal prosecution of the company as if it were occurring the day of the first discussions corporations almost always agree to the waiver and jj did in this case otherwise the government lawyers told the jj team they might be forced to bring a criminal case immediately without considering all that the other side might offer in terms of countervailing evidence or settlement concessions waiving the statute of limitations for a corporation was also part of the dance that eased some of the rough edges off of the adversary process so that a deal could be struckas for the executives “no lawyer is ever going to waive the statute for an individual” memeger explains “the corporation yes but not for a person”too big to nailas with not holding any individual responsible a misdemeanor plea for the corporation had also become almost automatic this was true even if evidence proving intent to defraud was strongthe government’s explanation for this is a variation on the “too big to jail” rationale used to explain why errant banks were treated leniently following the  financial collapse under the law any health care company convicted of or pleading to a felony is automatically disqualified from selling any of its products to medicare that could effectively put the company out of business because medicare is the country’s dominant health care buyer misdemeanors do not carry that penalty“these companies make hundreds of great products and have tens of thousands of people working for them” is how one prosecutor put it “do you really want to shut them down and eliminate those products”per the usual playbook the company would plead to one misdemeanor no individual executive would be chargedin fact you don’t have to under the same law waivers of the disqualification provision are allowed so that medicare can buy drugs or other products it needs or so that the units of a company not involved in the wrongdoing can be walled off“who wants to take a chance on a waiver” was how one government lawyer responded when i raised that with him “these companies would never agree to that”vicki starr goes househuntingby march  according to lawyers on both sides the prosecutors in philadelphia and the johnson  johnson lawyers thought they had reached the broad outlines of a deal jj would pay fines and civil damages totaling about  billion the numbers were still in flux and might go up or down a bit but that was the target everyone was focused onand per the usual playbook the company would plead guilty to one misdemeanorno individual executive would be chargedultimately the private qui tam lawyers led by sheller had to approve any settlement or their clients could withdraw and fight on the discussions were now far enough long that the government lawyers thought it necessary at least to give their ostensible cocounsel the courtesy of sharing the  billion figure the mix would be something like  million for the fine and  billion for the civil award under the false claims act“in april i got the call” starr recalls “the lawyers weren’t specific and said nothing was certain but that i should think about being in a home in washington state by the end of june”starr started househunting but then news began circulating in the financial press in may that the talks were as the wall street journal put it “on hold” the lawyers assured her again that nothing was certain but that the reason for the reported glitch was that the government wanted even more money everything seemed to be on trackbut in fact the process was becoming bogged downmemeger was not going to be allowed to close the deal by himself tony west had decided it was time to roll up all three prospective deals—the big case in philadelphia the notasbig omnicare case in boston and the relatively small case in san francisco—into one big deal besides west didn’t think memeger had been tough enough in negotiating his piece in fact he wanted the sum of each of the three pieces to be larger than their parts“what happened was that ultimately our friends at main justice stepped in and wanted more money for a global resolution” explains memeger referring to his bosses in washingtonaccording to one lawyer involved in the bargaining west who is now general counsel of pepsico and would not discuss any aspect of his work in his old job wanted  billion to make all of jj’s troubles go awaythe talks were moved mostly to a conference room at department of justice headquarters where the same routine of seemingly endless back and forth presentations would start to play outit now looked like vicki starr might have plenty of time to get used to her new home before she realized any tax savings from itthere was however one development in spring  that was a surprise starr’s former boss alex gorsky was about to be forced to testify under oath about how he had marketed risperdal‘i don’t remember the specific exercise’“i may remember from time to time during the course of the year that their management may provide the opportunity for additional investment in different areas of the business that was called a ‘money on the table’ exercise but i don’t remember the specific exercise”that was how alex gorsky answered a question about the “money on the table” reference in his email that precipitated the decision by his company to fund dr joseph biederman’s center for children and adolescent bipolar disordershis reference to “their management” was of course a reference to himself at janssen during that time he was managementgorsky depositionmay   p    on may   gorsky supported by four lawyers was forced to sit for a deposition at the philadelphia office of one of johnson  johnson’s law firms but this was not the session that had been demanded by the government federal prosecutors had suspended that fight while they tried to iron out a settlementinstead his questioner was a lawyer in sheller’s firm the deposition was carried out in advance of the personal injury cases sheller had brought on behalf of boys with gynecomastia which were scheduled to begin later in  this was gorsky’s opportunity to tell his and johnson  johnson’s side of the story and explain all of those seemingly damning internal documentsmost of his answers were similar to what he had to say about “money on the table” he either only vaguely remembered or didn’t remember at all for examplehis favorite adjective was “appropriate” for examplequestionabout the fda’s warning that marketing risperdal as safe andeffective in the elderly was “false and misleading” do you agree with that statement mr gorskygorskyi think throughout the time we felt that we were promoting risperdal in an appropriate manner based upon the label at the timequestionwell if johnson  johnson marketed risperdal to the children and adolescent market when risperdal was not approved for a pediatric use by the fda would that be illegalgorskybased on my knowledge and my review of the information i don’t believe that we—that is johnson  johnson or janssen—marketed the product in an inappropriate mannerquestionif johnson  johnson promoted risperdal to the children and adolescent market when it was not approved for any pediatric use by the fda would you consider that a breach of the johnson  johnson credogorskyi would consider inappropriate promotion of our products not consistent with the johnson  johnson credo but i’m not aware other than very unique or specific situations that can occur in a large organization i’m not aware of any concerted effort on the part of janssen or johnson  johnson to promote the drug inappropriatelyquestionmr gorsky did janssen or johnson  johnson market or promote risperdal to the child and adolescent market before risperdal was approved or indicated by the fda for pediatric usegorskybased upon my recollection and the documents i’ve seen we promoted it in an appropriate manneraccording to gorsky the various business plans he had been in charge of were not what they appeared to be for examplequestionreferring to one of the internal janssen business plans the next sentence says “although the risperdal base business is rooted in the schizophrenia marketplace another fastgrowing portion of this market is in children and adolescents” did i read that rightgorskyyes you didquestionand because of the growth of the child and adolescent antipsychotic market … did johnson  johnson begin to approach this market in a different way in or around gorskynot that i’m aware of other than we were continuing to pursue the clinical development program of the product in that areaquestionturn to the top of the next page please … down below it says “risperdal use in the childadolescent population is exploding” but in this time frame  risperdal is not indicated by the fda for any pediatric use is itgorskyagain we did not have the specific indication as we discussed earlier until  i don’t remember exactly what the labeling said regarding use in children but as i discussed earlier there was a significant—there appeared to be a significant increase in the recognition of this condition in children and adolescents during this time … which was substantiated by data and its occurrence and physicians have an opportunity to use a treatment that they perceive to be appropriate and effective in a particular patient population and that’s clearly what we were seeing happening in this areaquestionlook down at the heading that says “key base business goals and objectives” do you see thatgorskyyesquestionand the fifth of the key base business goals says “grow and protect share in childadolescents” is that rightgorskyyes that’s correctquestionmy question is how can johnson  johnson grow a share in a child and adolescent market when the drug isn’t even indicated for use in the child and adolescent marketgorskywell my interpretation of that is this is in fact a marketing plan not a selling plan as a marketing plan its intent is to cover a wide range of activities regarding the development as well as the promotion of risperdal that being said all of our actual promotion to the physicians would follow what was outlined in our package insert and all of our materials went through a significant review process and that’s the way our representatives were trained and in an area such as this this is a marketer versus a sales representative their languageit added up to an effective tap dance that must have made his lawyers proud but gorsky’s testimony was not nearly as important to his company as finishing the deal with federal prosecutorsfeb  the jj board citing a “rigorous thorough andthe jj board citing a “rigorous thorough and formal multiyear” selection process

gorsky who will become chief executive in april started at the company as a pharmaceutical sales representative credit david maxwellbloomberg news alex gorsky the newly named chief executive of johnson  johnson shares a crucial biographical detail with william c weldon the man he is succeeding both got their starts as pharmaceutical sales representatives a notoriously grueling job that — because it demands stamina charisma and a near devotion to making the sale — has become a crucible for future drug company executives in recent yearsalso like mr weldon mr gorsky is a johnson  johnson insider who served during one of the most tumultuous periods in the company’s history when there were manufacturing lapses government inquiries and recalls affecting popular overthecounter consumer productsmr gorsky served as head of the company’s medical device and diagnostics group at the same time that critical decisions were made about an artificial hip implant that has failed in thousands of patients crippling some of themtheir shared history has led some to speculate that not much will change when mr gorsky takes over in april advertisement continue reading the main story “as somebody steeped in j j culture i would be very surprised to see big changes” said les funtleyder a portfolio manager at miller tabak  company who owns the stock and even if mr gorsky plans such changes “it’s so big that it would take a very long time to move a big battleship like that” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story mr gorsky declined to be interviewed but in a statement on tuesday he said “i’m honored that the board has placed such confidence in me and i am also aware of the serious responsibilities that come with this office johnson  johnson is a strong and extraordinary company with enormous opportunities to advance health and well being”mr gorsky who is  fits the mold of someone who once “carried the bag” — industry slang for working as a sales representative he is known as a polished speaker and an intense yet likable manager who is a quick study when it comes to learning new topics that skill may serve him well at johnson  johnson which sells things as diverse as baby shampoo bandaids and antipsychotic drugs“it’s the school of hard knocks” said nona footz who leads the health care practice at rsr partners an executive search firm “you’re out there you’re knocking on doors you have very tough sales targets you get a lot of exposure you learn the business and then you’re promoted”but the ethos of the sales representative may not be what johnson  johnson needs right now said erik gordon who teaches business at the university of michigan “that culture was very much the weldon culture writ large — we will make our numbers for the analysts period” he said “and if that means we have to cut costs on things that affect quality then by god we’re going to make those numbers”by contrast mr gorsky’s main competitor for the chief executive job sheri s mccoy got her start at the company as a scientist in research and developmentas is typical for rising stars at large corporations mr gorsky held many jobs after starting with the

took over the medical device and diagnostic groupit was a particularly tumultuous time for the company’s orthopedic unit depuy just a few weeks earlier the food and drug administration refused to let it sell one of its hip implants in this country because it had failed to meet regulatory standards meanwhile complaints about that device and a companion version that was used in this country were mounting from doctors here and regulators abroad advertisement continue reading the main story it is not known what role if any mr gorsky played in depuy’s decision not to disclose the fda action but at the start of his tenure depuy decided to phase out the implants marketed as the asr and shut a factory in england that made themdepuy recalled the asr in august  amid rising failure rates but before then depuy executives repeatedly insisted that the asr was safe and mr gorsky stated publicly in  that the company had decided to drop it for business reasons not safety concernsin a recently disclosed depuy email a top executive wrote that the fda had refused to approve the device after seeing data showing it failing prematurely in significant numbers during company studies in patientsjohnson  johnson did not answer questions about whether mr gorsky had known about the problems associated with the artificial hips but his promotion to chief executive surprised dr robert hauser a cardiologist and an advocate for improved safety of medical devices“i mean come on what is this” dr hauser said “he’s been overseeing one of the major j j quality issues and the board of j j sees fit to name him the new ceo”others dismissed the issue saying it was unclear what knowledge mr gorsky had had of the trouble with the hips “it came out under his watch but it had nothing to do with his watch” said lewis c pell a medical devices entrepreneur who does business with the company and knows mr gorskymr funtleyder the portfolio manager said mr gorsky would face three challenges fixing the problems at the plants that make overthecounter products ensuring that there are lucrative prescription drugs in development and addressing a global dip in consumer use of medical services the company also must close its deal to buy synthes a medical device maker mr gorsky negotiated the acquisitiondespite its troubles the company has several new prescription drugs that have been selling well including zytiga a prostate cancer drug the company earned  million or  cents a share in the fourth quarter of  an  percent drop from  billion or  cents a year earlier the drop was largely caused by a  billion charge related to the recall of its artificial hips continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related coverage

regulation drug innovation and other topics at a recent wall street journal viewpoints breakfast in new york city       transcript this transcript has been automatically generated and may not be  accurate thinking about how many products and johnson johnson for use before you even when out the door this morning so  no  thanks  my eyes with a  aam thats good  the the the  the uh seventy billion dollars and im going to intern fifty different company is  under your gigantic we of course  we know baby powder but theyre also in biologics hands  every aspect of cancer immunology medical devices consumer products  and cost only investing in acquiring and getting into all kinds of new and carry  a areas  just talking about even begun as we know this a big election coming up  what the first question they will be is  the health law  its been one the most controversial was ever passed  can you have one can say this is can throw down the aisle and officials can fix it  defended and do some things like go after the drug companies prices can now  whats your view about how  the law has done so far and what can be done in the future  again  a health plan for this country works sure  offers all just a real pleasure to be here and a  got some always humble  its in deal represent johnson johnson  and a hundred and thirty thousand people plus around the world to  really do get up every day trying to make sure the people excuse me a live longer  healthier and happier lives  and im really happy you got appeasing those products the small  village  with most people  recognize is for our consumer products that  meet its two foot pole when i say johnsons baby shampoo  coming and you can actually smell  right now  thats a pretty good brand  i needed it touches you in a very special way and that something to remind you of the baby  and put you in a good place in  and we realize that there is an incredible responsibility that goes along with that kind of bringing  in a in this country level around the world something we take seriously  but so  health care  it wasnt for him wheres it going to go  clearly were in a very political season right now  and i guess my fame with his regardless of who gets elected  of  healthcare is going in the aviary dominant force and dynamic in issue  the likely the next several generations are going to be dealing with not only in this country but around the world  and  you know why is that well  i think first of all  represents about  eighteen percent of the economy here in united states  about three trillion dollars  i think secondly its incredibly complex  if you think about the system  between the hospitals the providers insurance companies  the product makers  its a its a complex  law urge  very complicated system  and a certain him as soon as you pull on one spraying it affects another its a bit of a rubiks cube  and you know what may seem obvious looking at it from one thousand  always isnt so obvious when you look at it from the other  hence it makes it challenging  in the third and third part of it but id  i think is probably most important laurie you and i were talking off right when you get to be about our age we start talking about well what the hell plays with me and says  oh yes this  year we were  come is are eating about that  healthcare is really personal  the thing about those times when  you have a health care issue  the first thing that happens is the physician talks to when youre going  what he she just  its complicated signs  youre youre confused  you can even pronounce the words many times  in the next thing is youre thinking about the system in your going okay do i see a specialist who was determined to go to hospital the apus whos gonna pay for this is a good one being reimbursed  and so at a very personal level it touches its  insight between those three things together  it helps explain why  healthcare such  you know seminal issue  right now and when you combine that frankly  with the macro forces that we see around the world  asian populations in the good news is were living longer  much of the specimens country because the health care that we get  the challenges  a living patient  a healthy one will consume or the economy than one thats not what its  and  they knew you go from there and you look at technology with all the other factors  to go outside the united states is to see developing economies continuing to improve  as you move up the economic ladder as you can shelter as if it was the next thing youre likely to consume one to consume more  often  and so  wherever i go around the world and id talk with leaders  this issue of  were going to have this increasing demand  that is just a secular trend  and how are we going to pay for how one picture quality  we can win and make sure that you know frankly in some cases to maintain stability in society  by doing a thoughtful way  i wish i could do no wave along  with the right so my i think its  its going to require a lot to like you get back to the end of the affordable care act whats taking place in the united states  but i think its  theres some good news  the good news is is that we got about twenty five million people here in united states are now covered  by insurance were covered  a couple years ago  when timmy was untenable think between forty or forty five million people in this country  really didnt have access to ensure its we have that now  about eleven million exchanges the fifty million more the expansion of medicaid  thats very good  i think the other dynamic is over the last two years was a little bit of tempering of inflation around health care  what we can attribute that to be difficult to say i think its a combination of forces i think employers  than paying a lot more attention people of the more thoughtful  we can talk about copays to talk about a lot of other things that the economy  the wee seen some tempering which has a huge impact on the  twenty percent  in the end of the purse of unemployed in this country is gone from about seventeen percent to ten percent  were still not all the way it is still more work to do obviously got work to do an exchange is to ensure competition  the challenge that we have going for is what we increase access  now we have the hard work ahead as we address  this balance here  and costs  and we havent  they havent faced in new a lot of those issues  and many of those things were further down the road in the law  were starting to get there now  you were coming up with some models of moving from a fee for service system  the really disconnect utilization of services  with because  towards more of an outcomes based approach  or a episode of care based approach  which i think is much much better way to do it but were early days  were starting to take in a much more holistic approach that  you know with patient care around infections of the house in a hospital treatment  longer term bungling of different issues  in so doing that in a very thoughtful way that openly keeps the pace in the center  that helps ensure we balance  you care quality cost  it sustains the innovation that were going to need to take on future issues  and health care  thats the hard work  i still think that sprouts  of course that got the population itself when you make the numbers about americans know maybe thirty or more adults are obese  i think the one in four has two or more chronic diseases  we see the data that says we spend more  or less health and other countries although  as you mentioned before we were not finland where everybodys got the same issues the same genes  but um  how do you go about than addressing the other side of the equation which is  americans who arent  doing well this convention on me taking care of themselves on eating right exercising  here you  corporations have a big role to play in this and you know this is interesting things going on around that area  i feel johnson johnson itself has done a lot there in this companies all getting together to try to figure out  i get emails for our company you know  heres something you can do to be well and i dont know how many people pay attention to those that  i mean get people to  you get  a partnership between eighty employ years and people  to start into these areas where youre not can it  italys klingon to quit smoking or canning exercise  yet what the guide  again i dont think theres a silver bullet he is going to take a combination of approaches i think  its other things i mentioned earlier so we go to from fee for service to so to care outcomes bespokes starts there  are we better integrate some of the knowledge that we have systems  you are still incredibly disconnected in many ways yes we have electronic medical records  were starting to make some of those connections but they that offers great promise  i think the third biggest area that is exactly what he mentioned  how we prevent these things from happening for sports  how we address and  phone in  but what is  the best parts of my job  is that  i get to go into these rooms filled with remarkable scientists  they can be talking about the next bt can do better  in lymphoma  i can walk in the next room has a bunch of engineers talking about  you know were going to do it all trow  philharmonic  um  surgical instruments  that can cut colletti late this kind of rate and reduce morbidity xpos surgery i dont the next room i see jennifer anniston commercial neutrogena  so you really get says see  the full stop them  but if i if you get the scientists are um i think what motivates them most is  how we  can we stop these things from ever happening because  with no harm  done psychologists will tell you  is that  no by the time we can detect to work today  it shows up when ctu an mri  the cells of probably replicated somewhere between thirty or forty cents  if they replicate about five or six more times in public stage  and what can we get to that that that that that the town  and and to do that  you know what what can we learn from whether its genomics with its protein with its dna rna  how can we  heal go from the class will test all the state today is members and how can we have similar scans as relates to things like apology alzheimers another  were we can intervene much earlier in the process  and stop this cascade  combined with the cascade  it existing cancer  it exists in all its i its  you know weve invested literally billions of dollars on some of the things we find  is that were probably  intervening in the eight am  its far too late  to really be able to make a difference  and in here to look i think some of that is less  about seventy five percent  of any of the chronic conditions  the old smoothly and that taking most of its things like cardiovascular disease  things like smoking  and  diabetes  are significantly influenced by what we do every day  what we are in our caloric intake our activity level  in a do we choose to smoke or do we not smile  we manage stress  and yet something more paying a lot of attention to were one of you know we are early company to invest in health and wellness i can tell its a tough business  theres a diet  in just about every corner  in doing it in a database meaningful way in changing behavior is not easy you probably know that with the families and spouses  my answer was that  and  but that its  its got to be part of that and look we  weve been doing a johnson johnson for about forty years jim bourke you know sobel presence is back said you know  before them the biggest health care company  we should be the obvious health care  and  weve weve invested a lot of things ranging from the food we offer our cafeteria its  the things that we put in the gyms that we put  more more were finding is will we designed the workplace  to encourage people to stand up and was standing just walk around more  little things  how do we make sure that theyve got access  to health and wellness programs now online all the time given  to the absence of seven metre that you can do  so theres no excuse  and that the canal so we make sure someone is that when people have reported that in their family to  the franking amanda jane  you know the psychological part of that as well as the physical as we know that those two are tied together  an old one we believe that look if you create a healthy environment  if somebody can show up at work  in their best a divinity the us  and and  and thats in your  the longterm impact you can have on how they can end up on the company is directly correlated  but they help them wellness prevention intervention is gonna be a big part  of the  long term solution for help  well of course a bow to invest a lot in research and all the currency were talking about that its a lot of money to find something if youre in the extinction oscar is now  to get back to the convention for states to take a lot of money  and of course the drug companies are  less recognized public release for the money to spend in the search than they are  the prices they charge so  all of  the coverage in all of the media tends to be  about  prices and obviously the latest flap was about the epi pen  how do you address that issue about  to get the public to understand  how is it possible to  do the research you have to do and yet  charge prices that are not going to cause  such consternation  in the southern ranges many people coming in  below a dead  i would start this doesnt look this is a challenging issue  and i think its representative and an act of a lot of things that we face in health care  because of the complexity  in other issues but let me maybe provide a little bit perspective  i think it really starts  with its belief in innovation  and um  again i think we are at a remarkable time in history  why think over the next ten to fifteen years we could see some of the most promising unremarkable breakthroughs  that we seen over the last generation  think of moores law applied to health care and outsourcing  and again when youre able to complying  so many different approaches  to really understand the real because the underlying have the physiology  of things like all signers cancer  cardiovascular disease  the schools that we have now to do that pretty remarkable  look  the reason we have those  a significant portion is because  we get the government the nih investing about thirty billion dollars  weve got the bio pharmaceutical industry investing about fifty billion dollars  weve been doing that over a long period of time  and  were  were reading some of the fruits of that as we speak we have a discussion later about is that the right amount is wrong about that  i think thats really important we  we continue to think about the role of innovation i think the  the second part of it is  yet to come step back look of the system and all  again  every time its a rubiks cube every time you turn one side has an impact on the other  and  you what you see in the in united states for example  is about  fourteen percent of the three trillion dollars that we invest in healthcare  is spent on farms  thats not retell sites will is the hospitals  and and that certainly is an important point about fifty percent is in healthcare it isnt the provider side theres a lot of other buckets  that particular area tends to get a lot the spotlight  if you look at the data over the last twenty or thirty years  we would suggest is  the increase in longevity  and it makes life expectancy  and the reason why several years ago  two or three patients with cancer diagnosed with cancer i would die within five years and thats when  think of it not what  i was just graduating college hiv was hitting the news  if you are diagnosed with hiv  in the early eighties  you would probably have about five years  today  it takes about two years of the average life expectancy  if you follow the right drug rich  thats pretty remarkable we have changed a death sentence to chronic disease alike  now we still have more work to do  or working hard on vaccines a lot of other things  but  i think its important  that to recognize that theres been a tremendous amount of benefit and  unfortunately thats really difficult to communicate times to sell my  and again in in in in again  if philosophically emotionally  someone doesnt agree  with a market based approach to health care we can go through the facts and figures all day long that  it will be as meaningful  i think it all to lead the way that we think about it is look its most important prices the weekend  and we bring products to market the really make a difference for patients  and because we dont continue to innovate  i can say right now we dont come up with the way to take on all sides going forward  even if we hold health care costs where they are today  we are going to be really challenge this generation is its stock  so we we wanted it that we wanna  we wanna make sure that weve got something thats the next pandemic trouble for see  where  did that  pray well i mean that again is this idea that  as we spending all this money and yours for existing diseases you keep getting this rising tide of  infectious diseases in emerging infections in re emerging infectious diseases you have  i think that antibiotic resistance and people were opposed to vaccines  so  you work with them that know obviously we have the gates foundation president here last and to talk about some the things are going to  mess with mosquitoes so they can  these diseases and some questions it and you know what should we or i keep the species  alm that ethically correct  when the  other one  when you say they serve anyway the lead  so what in the new work  aerial  investing in vaccines that can be also very  its difficult and challenging aam with where you stand on the pandemic  diseases  you know youre working really we are the god of all significantly um  both with the bowler and see the  and look you know what we find is that your pandemic preparedness truly been read or  something that weve worked hard with the government on  the leisure nenad states that  about two years ago stemming in scotland on time with england merkel  in european countries doctor paul stoffels laudanum r and d in fact  was in the uk just of the last few days and belgium talking about this very issue  and  you know if i was  so important  is that we harmonize some of the regulatory summit clinical development guidelines  around these pandemics because  youll be fine now is because of the way were all connected flying around the world daily  you know the the ability of these pandemics to spread very very quickly  is just gone up its financial  and yet the science behind it is much more challenging  so it starts with  we can in  its rear of one company  or one governments can coupled with the solution is to know why all this to work together  that  you know we work very hard on as with the number of regulators in the number of government is what is our playbook for doing that  because a we dont wanna be is in the middle of the of bowl a free pandemic  and trying to figure out should we or should we not be doing a placebo controlled trial in a bid to complex  it will be too late  and frankly hundreds or thousands or more  could die in that intervening time  so  getting regulars coming together to agree  around whats the standard outs of the week and be prepared for that  opening a door so the companies can work together  and that we dont let ikea we dont let other issues in the way to the third thing that we find is  how we make sure we got the capacity  me theres a couple parts of axing  really hard part is getting on the works  that actually goes inspected the other really hard part is  he produce enough of that  the challenge with some of the vaccines as they can take two or three years to have an adequate number of doses teaming up to a few million  so weve been working really hard some other techniques that  instead of that we move into a beaker  last but not least  we make sure that we can get the last mile we work with the gates foundation with other and she owes  so they  not only do we get the vaccines to the dock to the health care system  but how can we make sure that they actually get to the climate  that they can be delivered the health care workers that can do it in the right way  that is a huge pass  and that but i think the good news is  these last several times  companies governments and a lot of people are working very hard together  to streamline the whole process  because one  one thing i can say with certainty  is there will be  other things that we cant predict happening in the future we need to do a better job  we maintained ip intellectual property in  two grades or ten k and what things its that and there was that dom if youve never been in that time when theres been a more hostile regulatory environment towards into actual property  received many drugs that are still on patent but  already have  competitors in the generic field  coming in the china market  competitors to that of the aisle similar steps  aam  when you  and you got fda regulations are sometimes most drugs are approved in europe before their approves here  how do you see that regulatory and intellectual property environment  in the future is that if you think it can be done to improve that or can you operate in that  im in a  it might seem strange for somebody of my role to stop by say is that you not be the first one to tell you  that i think  having a responsible pathway for generics were  up  by some lawyers  is absolutely critical for health care system  its actually i think  a very healthy  part  of a innovative  healthcare  marketplace and in what i mean how well  we did have hustlers if you dont have generics over time  it thats thats the  thats the benefit if youre investing for the future like you mean thats about nine billion dollars last year  and and we do that knowing that we can all would be rewarded well if there are no generics in any catholic pressure of system in some way  thats just not sustainable  i think if your company that is investing  look theres been a lot of actors lately that have been investing we think thats important  in and provides for a whole the overall uses  sets number one number two though gotta make sure that we keep the patient this time  and what i mean by that is  lets make sure you know what number one the  companies follow the appropriate on the lawns  number two  that that all the right regulatory pathways  youre there theres a difference between generic some but so much for assembling of toll is basically a chemical compound that can be replicated here  biologic is approaching celebratory  so  protea name  isnt it said was similar its never an exact replica  the same  we know we are the first in the field of  tf anas and  biologics  and very minor differences in the protein can have a pretty significant fact that they get to make sure the winners and then another use  so  we think youre absolutely parts and we think that its gotta be done and a thoughtful way  and  that were working with regulators and you know and others to ensure that in the current system is its  a sign that devices because thats the other big area of courts  and most of us can fall for me things in place i think that is close to him  everything is brand  and identity of the people of having these in the hands and this is still there over here  the elites post surgery  the the the the  you know thats thats an area of  you know those surgeries even though theyre incredibly  um you changed peoples lives they can also have risks attached to know i know youre some some of your devices and the tv calder  know people are thinking of these infections that happened during surgery  what can you do in the surgical field of advanced safety make this all by on a can  email get an idea  his ankle replacements now  look theres a few just a couple things couple monday the first of all  making surgery is  of  minimally invasive as possible  and among enemies might have as an example so your today theres a couple ways you can do that theres a post i will do lyndon johnson and you promise  to lead to  syria approach with a basically go into blue teal  and they had that having to cut quite a bit of muscle than of you out there are places that they get very  good in  a traditionally you going to be very good positioning  of the head  and however it would take you  several  several months actually recover because you would have to kill your boss was was the joint  today the news was called answer for some adds another my pocket is  little even system like that  they can go and because of improvements in surgical technique  and floss compete with the imaging that they can use  baking go and basically they did my second procedure no muscles with minimal muscle was cut by the way that that is the most part outside  their place in shawnee  to three hours after surgery i was able to walk with a walker  the next morning i walked around the floor with the came  within three days i walked a mile  now traditionally that would have taken years that the way they close all four layers  you know of  muscle tissue thats a scan  they can do it now was sutures that helps reduce the infection  than would normally occur  in the way that was pre operative liam post op we treated with  antibiotics  so if you put all that together  you reduce infection in euro disco morbidity is  youve got good pre operative preparation and post operative care physical therapy  you get those results  in you know more more were finding is  that we use a smaller incision  we get more tools  and other devices  to cut poletti lake control bleeding to all those things  you know again to intro car rather than having to open someone up thats thats the first  the other area that im really excited about  is how we migrate some of the technology that we usually play in silicom valley on our i phones sensing devices  into devices that we normally nothing to others but once its its the gugle partnership the gugle partnership so  what did you two examples one is in surgery any other  lets talk about might  well imagine a device in the future  instead of just putting and  stab a ball of clay your cavill on your pelvis  one of those heads sensor devices and  to the point that is talked about earlier  ok the biggest concern  for a orthopedist doing hip replacement couple things one is making she get the positioning just right so the forces are correct  and say dont have one leg shorter and they dont develop issues  on that if we had a sensor in that device that can measure those forces  and they can give them a very early indicator if they were all lying  so that they could do it for actively versus what were doing now gets  imagine if we had thermal sensors in the same things  so we can determine an infection weeks before it manifests itself  the way that it does now elevation  best group best milton on what im talking about things being worked on today  ok which is so  meaty another example  everyone is very excited right now but the driverless car  what if we take some of that same global technology that were doing right now in a partnership  with verily  and we apply ch robotics are  euroglut is urging the silly decision  to go in this isnt going to be instrumental in all this bad  you know  theres so much that we can do a lot of great surgeons is great certain how can we take  a good surgeon and make them an even better soon  and by applying some of the same vision capability  algorithms that can be tight in the thousands and thousands of surgeries that no word to cut along the margin  you know of a  cancerous i was not where to cut the particular area for doing an orthopedic replacement  something they can help guide them along the way  the key to the ongoing track record of what whats occurred  we think can make a tremendous difference longterm again in overall surgical outcome so those are a couple of examples that  were very excited  recommended for you  up next trump to police dont be too nice  pm

kws leadership content alex gorsky a year veteran of johnson  johnson was appointed chairman and ceo of jj in  the new brunswick njbased health care enterprise has close to  employees revenues of approximately  billion and more than  operating companies around the world gorsky discusses his leadership style approach to decision making and common leadership myths during a recent interview with wharton management professors michael useem and adam grant  an edited transcript of the conversation follows  michael useem alex welcome i am going to start with a question about the toughest decision that you have made in the last year or so describe that decision what were the conflicting concerns and then how did you work it through given the fact that you lead a rather large company alex gorsky fortunately or unfortunately during my career i have had a chance to take part in some pretty significant decisions along the way be it strategic business or operational but i’ve got to say i think some of the most challenging and probably the most challenging have been related to very significant organizational and people changes within our company particularly when you know this is something that can impact employees’ future that can affect families those are things that you always want to do with a lot of thought with a lot of care and a lot of empathy those types of decisions for me personally have always been some of the most challenging there are a few things that we try to do obviously the first is make sure that you’ve got the right team around you so many of the decisions that ultimately wind their way to me have by and large been decided by a great group of leaders who have a tremendous amount of responsibility in terms of their businesses and the organizations that they represent second it’s to make sure that as you’re going through and making those decisions you provide an atmosphere where you can really have debate where you can really have challenge where there’s not just a preordained recommendation – and frankly where one plus one can equal four or five in the whole decision making process i’ve always found that encouraging a diversity of opinion by different members sometimes even challenging people to come in and argue the opposite of the direction that we’re heading in really makes sure that you have thought through the implications last but not least it’s once you’ve made that decision — recognizing that there’s going to be different points of view – then getting full alignment around your leadership team so that you’re speaking in one voice and in a common direction that’s what i’ve seen be one of the biggest challenges but that’s the way that we tried to deal with it — to make sure that we’re ultimately making the best decisions for the company and all our stakeholders adam grant alex is there an example that stands out particularly when it comes to challenging people to bring different opinions or maybe even argue for the opposite of what they believe were you able to stimulate that and did it have a positive effect gorsky i’ve had a number of examples along the way but i think one in particular stands out for me related to one of our products where we were making a specific recommendation about it on the market there was a lot of pressure tied to the issue right before we made that decision i remember calling our chief counsel that night and saying “i’d like you to talk to a law firm and actually have them argue the opposite point of view” so we went outside the company… what i found through that process was that we ended up staying with the right decision but taking that pause made sure that we had much more confidence and conviction in our position… yes you want to be a decision maker but you also have got to realize the impact that your decisions can have i think taking that extra moment having that extra challenge is good practice useem alex you came out of the us military academy at west point and took a job pretty much at the ground level in a unit at johnson  johnson in your first job as i recall you led nobody you were pretty much on your own but you moved up to  employees   and now  how have you had to change your leadership style going from nobody to a few then a lot and now over  how has your thinking about leadership evolved what’s different now from the way you would have led say  years ago in the way you operate knowledgewharton high school gorsky your leadership does need to evolve as you move through an organization i think there are a lot of lessons that you learn along the way number one is learning the importance of “it’s not really what i do but it’s about what the people who you work with do” and working through others i think that’s one of the biggest challenges facing you — just learning that skill where you’re no longer the individual contributor but you’re contributing by bringing together a group of people who have different skills different capabilities and working through them to accomplish a particular task i see that as being a significant challenge facing many leaders as they move through an organization that was certainly one for me the second one is understanding the global impact of your decision when you’re starting in one particular area and have a rather local impact to today where every decision you make can have an impact globally — from mumbai to minneapolis from warsaw to miami and always considering what that true global impact of a particular decision can be last but not least it’s about always trying to predict what the strategic implications are so what are the second or third order consequences of a particular decision versus the immediate impact johnson  johnson fortunately is a company that has been around for over  years i’m always trying to think about “what is it over the next  years” — not the next just one year or two years certainly there’s always an issue du jour that we’re working on but i’m trying to think about what are the decisions that we can make what are the directions we can go in that are going to continue our track record and sustainability for the next decade for the next  years “encouraging a diversity of opinion by different members … makes sure that you have thought through the implications” grant alex you’re known not only as someone who cares a lot about developing leaders but also about your leaders developing leaders below them how do you figure out one who those people are who are likely to be good at leadership development and two what do you actually teach them gorsky that’s a great question i do believe that one of the best indicators of leadership is a leader’s track record in developing leaders i will frequently focus on three areas when i’m interviewing or when i’m talking to people one is certainly on performance because you always want to have leaders who are committed to high performance and … handling a wide range of different scenarios second i always focus on what’s their track record of developing future leaders one of my favorite questions is to ask people is “if i asked you who had the biggest impact on your career and how they did that who are those four people that you would name” at a senior level if they can’t name three or four fairly senior level people then immediately i question their wherewithal in people development “people are not looking for a perfect leader they want a leader who cares about them and is going to help them try to be better” last i’ll ask how do they move their businesses how do they develop talent with our credo in mind it gives me an indication of how committed they are to developing individuals to developing teams and frankly figuring out how to work through others to get their jobs done useem at johnson  johnson what do you think is the perception of leadership in general maybe leadership in particular in your own experience that turns out to be most incorrect what do people looking at leaders often not see gorsky i think that one of the most significant myths about leadership is that the top leader is there to just make the decision versus taking much more of a serviceoriented approach knowing that you are in service to many of those who are going to be impacted by your decision i can tell you right now that i definitely approach the job from the latter perspective always trying to understand the consequences the implications that your decisions are going to have on your different stakeholders ranging from customers the communities that you work in your shareholders your employees all the people who might be touched and learning that at the end of the day we’re really in service to them — that the jobs that we do … have got to ultimately be helping all of those stakeholders realize their objectives i think frequently it’s not about the “boss” making a certain decision it’s the decisions we make in service to those stakeholders that are really important grant building on that what is the success or accomplishment over your career that you’re most proud of gorsky the thing that i’m most proud of are the great leaders that i’ve had a chance to work with along the way who have gone on to take great positions of responsibility and frankly made a difference within jj and of course in other areas as well i’ve had the opportunity to work with a broad number of people through my several decades at the firm frankly starting with my time in the military and with my time as a coach with my son’s teams to my time at johnson  johnson and some time at new artists as well there’s nothing that gives me greater satisfaction than knowing that people have been able to go on and do a lot of good things for patients for consumers along the way that gives me a great deal of satisfaction and of course most importantly just knowing that the products and the services that we’re offering every day hopefully are helping people live longer healthier and happier lives that’s a great sense of satisfaction “how do you make sure every day — when decisions are made in many different areas around the world and in different business organizations – that the credo remains our moral compass the glue that holds us together” useem a question for people who are just coming into leadership responsibilities think about the first job where you had a responsibility for others think maybe even later on but especially for those who are first taking on a significant leadership role from your own experience what are the one or two lines of advice that you’d like to pass on to them so they can get to where they want to go in taking on that leadership obligation gorsky a couple of things one is that it’s really important for early leaders to be themselves so often leaders get into a role and maybe have some ideal of what it is to be a leader i think the most important thing that a new leader can have stepping into a role is humility understanding that they’re going to learn that they’re going to make mistakes and to approach the scenario as something where they’re going to have to grow into the position having that kind of a mindset will immediately endear the people who are working with you and around you they’re not looking for a perfect leader they want a leader who cares about them and is going to help them try to be better i think as a new leader if you remember this that they expect you to be human that you’re going to make mistakes and that as long as you learn and care for the people who are working with you i think that’s the most important thing you can do useem quick final question on that… you’ve got people all over the world and thus the tone you set at the top the culture the ethics the values become critical johnson  johnson has a very famous credo about  words that say “we’re here on earth to serve people who need our products great community great employment setting and then we work for shareholders as well” when i was in your headquarters a couple of years ago i noticed that this credo is carved in stone on the main floor of headquarters what happens if you want to change the credo gorsky well mike as you know the credo … was written over  years ago by general robert wood johnson himself it’s been a great source of inspiration and it does outline our responsibilities to our different stakeholders — all that you mentioned including customers employees communities as well as shareholders ultimately and through the years there have been a few times when it has been updated but the core principles are something that we don’t think should change as i stepped into this role just as my predecessors i think one of the first things we’ve always tried to do is reaffirm our commitment to those core principles embodied in that document now i think what’s more important for us in the organization is how we bring that credo to life how do you make sure every day — when decisions are made in many different areas around the world and in different business organizations – that the credo remains our moral compass the glue that holds us together that’s something that we constantly reinforce through town hall meetings through outreach programs in fact this year is the th anniversary of our credo we’re having a credo challenge session where every board of the  companies that you mentioned earlier is challenging the relevance of our credo and going through it line by line it’s by … keeping this alive in the organization — which we think is incredibly important – that we make sure we do the right thing supports kws leadership content citing knowledgewharton close for personal use please use the following citations to quote for personal use mla
