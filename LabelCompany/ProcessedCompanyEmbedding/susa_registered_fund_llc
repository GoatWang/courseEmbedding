nondiversified management investment company that was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the state of delaware on november   interests in the company are being issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any public offering  a      within the meaning of section  of andor regulation d under the securities act investments in the company may be made only by accredited investors as defined in regulation d under the securities act and by qualified clients as defined in rule  under the advisers act the relevant investor qualifications for initial and subsequent subscriptions by investors will be set forth in a subscription agreement that must be completed by each prospective investor this registration statement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security within the meaning of the securities act investment objective and practices the companys objective is capital appreciation in pursuing its investment objective the company seeks to maximize riskadjusted absolute returns across the business cycle regardless of market conditions the adviser employs a valueoriented investment strategy that focuses on both long and short positions in equity securities of european companies the company generally expects to maintain a net long exposure where the value of its long positions exceeds the value of its short positions with exceptions during rare periods where the adviser believes a net short exposure is more appropriate based on its assessment of overall market conditions the companys performance is expected to depend primarily on individual stock selection general price movements in the market will also affect the companys investment performance equity securities purchased and sold by the company may include common and preferred stocks convertible securities stock options call and put options warrants and rights and other investments that possess equity characteristics the company is not subject to any restriction as to the industry sector or market capitalization of companies in which it invests nevertheless the adviser considers industry sector and market capitalization of companies in making its investment decisions for the company to the extent that affects the expected returns and risks of investments and the composition of the companys investment portfolio the company may invest without limitation in securities of european issuers which for these purposes are companies that derive a majority of their revenue or profits from european businesses investments or sales or that have a majority of their operations or assets located in europe the companys investments may also include investments in the securities of companies that are located in or conduct business in emerging or less developed countries these investments are typically subject to certain risks to a much greater degree than investments in the securities of companies in developed countries the company may also invest in the securities of other countries including the us the company may also invest in debt securities and certain derivative instruments such as options swaps forward contracts and options on stock indices transactions in these types of securities may be used in seeking capital appreciation or for hedging purposes the use of these investment techniques and instruments involve certain risks the companys investment program may make frequent use of leverage for investment purposes including to facilitate short sales of securities borrowings and certain investment positions considered to be senior securities for purposes of the  act are subject to a  asset coverage requirement imposed by the  act other than this asset coverage requirement there is no limitation on the extent to which the company may employ leverage in its investment program economic leverage obtained from the use of derivatives may exceed the limitations of the  act that would apply to leverage obtained through borrowings or the issuance of other senior securities the use of short sales and leverage are considered speculative investment practices and involve certain risks the use of leverage including economic leverage is monitored by the adviser as part of its ongoing risk management process  a      during periods of adverse market conditions in the equity securities markets the company may invest all or a portion of its assets in high quality debt securities or money market instruments or hold its assets in cash the company also invests in money market instruments and shares of money market funds for liquidity purposes in making investment decisions for the company the adviser uses fundamental investment analysis and indepth research to identify attractive investment opportunities the advisers investment process involves a research driven bottomup analysis of a securitys potential for appreciation or depreciation and includes consideration of the financial condition earnings outlook and strategy management and industry position of issuers this analytical process involves the use of valuation models review and analysis of published research and in some cases discussions with industry experts and company visits the adviser also takes into account economic and market conditions the companys investment program emphasizes active management of the companys portfolio consequently the companys portfolio turnover and brokerage commission expenses may significantly exceed those of other registered investment companies and other investment entities of comparable size additionally a high portfolio turnover rate may also result in the greater realization of capital gains including shortterm gains which are taxable to members at the same rates as ordinary income nevertheless the tax implications of the companys active trading style generally are not a factor in the management of the companys portfolio additional information about the types of investments that are made by the company its investment practices and related risk factors is provided below except as otherwise indicated the companys investment policies and restrictions are not fundamental and may be changed without a vote of its members fundamental investment restrictions the company has adopted the following six fundamental investment policies which cannot be changed without the vote of a majority of the companys outstanding voting securities as defined by the  act the company will not invest  or more of the value of its total assets in the securities other than us government securities of issuers engaged in any single industry the company will not issue senior securities representing stock but may borrow money from banks brokers and other lenders and may engage in transactions involving the issuance by the company of senior securities representing indebtedness to the extent permitted by the  act the company will not underwrite securities of other issuers except insofar as the company may be deemed an underwriter under the  act in connection with the disposition of its portfolio securities  a        the company will not make loans of money or securities to other persons except through purchasing fixedincome securities lending portfolio securities or entering into repurchase agreements in a manner consistent with the companys investment policies the company will not purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts but the company may purchase and sell foreign currency and enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may engage in other transactions in financial instruments in each case to the extent permitted under the companys investment policies as in effect from time to time the company will not purchase hold or deal in real estate but may invest in securities that are secured by real estate or that are issued by companies that invest or deal in real estate risk factors general current market conditions and governmental actions all securities investments risk the loss of capital investors may experience a significant decline in the value of their investment prospective investors should invest only if they can sustain a complete loss of their investment to the extent that the company makes substantial investments in securities of a single issuer or issuers in a single industry sector the risk of any investment decision is increased in addition the value of the companys investments can be reduced by unsuccessful investment strategies poor selection of equity securities poor economic growth pronounced market volatility and political regulatory and legal developments investors could lose some or all of their investment business and regulatory risks of hedge funds legal tax and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the company that may adversely affect the company the regulatory environment for hedge funds is evolving and changes in the regulation of hedge funds may adversely affect the value of investments held by the company and the ability of the company to obtain the leverage they might otherwise obtain or to pursue their trading strategies in addition the securities and futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes regulations and margin requirements the securities and exchange commission the sec other regulators and selfregulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies there has been an increase in governmental as well as selfregulatory scrutiny of the alternative investment industry in general with the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act there will be extensive rulemaking and regulatory changes that will affect private fund managers the funds that they manage and the financial industry as a whole additionally under the doddfrank act the sec is expected to mandate new recordkeeping and reporting requirements for investment advisers which would add costs to the legal operations and compliance obligations of the adviser and the company and  a      increase the amount of time that the adviser spends on noninvestment related activities until the sec implements the new requirements it is unknown how burdensome such requirements will be the doddfrank act will affect a broad range of market participants with whom the company interacts or may interact including banks nonbank financial institutions rating agencies mortgage brokers credit unions insurance companies payday lenders and brokerdealers regulatory changes that will affect other market participants are likely to change the way in which the adviser conducts business with its counterparties parts of the doddfrank act such as the volker rule and the pushout provision may change the landscape of the financial industry until the implementation of such regulatory changes it is difficult to anticipate the impact on the adviser the board of managers and the company it may take years to understand the impact of the doddfrank act on the financial industry as a whole and therefore the continued uncertainty may make markets more volatile and it may be more difficult for the adviser to execute the investment strategy of the company this registration statement does not address or anticipate every possible current or future regulation that may affect the adviser the company or their businesses such regulations may have a significant impact on the members or the operations of the company including without limitation restricting the types of investments the company may make preventing the company from exercising its voting rights with regard to certain financial instruments requiring the company to disclose the identity of its investors or otherwise the board of managers in consultation with the adviser may cause the company to be subject to such regulations if it believes that an investment or business activity is in the companys interest even if such regulations may have a detrimental effect on one or more members prospective members are encouraged to consult their own advisors regarding an investment in the company the effect of any future regulatory change on the company could be substantial and adverse nature of investments sector concentration the adviser will have broad discretion in making investments for the company investments will generally consist of equity securities and other assets that may be affected by business financial market or legal uncertainties there can be no assurance that the adviser will correctly evaluate the nature and magnitude of the various factors that could affect the value of and return on investments prices of investments may be volatile and a variety of factors that are inherently difficult to predict such as domestic or international economic and political developments may significantly affect the results of the companys activities and the value of its investments in addition the value of the companys portfolio especially fixed income securities may fluctuate as the general level of interest rates fluctuates furthermore in addition to market and economic conditions affecting the securities markets generally the companys investments and its performance will be affected by risk factors particular to the specific sectors in which it invests equity securities the success of the companys investment program may be affected by general economic and market conditions such as interest rates availability of credit inflation rates economic uncertainty changes in laws and national and international political circumstances these factors may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity of the companys investments unexpected volatility or illiquidity could impair the companys profitability or result in losses  a      a significant portion of the companys investment portfolio normally consists of long and short positions in common stocks and other equity securities the value of the companys equity securities varies in response to many factors including but not limited to the activities and financial condition of individual companies the business market in which individual companies compete and general market and economic conditions the companys investments in equity securities may include securities that are listed on securities exchanges as well as unlisted securities that are traded overthecounter equity securities of companies traded overthecounter may not be traded in the volumes typically found on a national securities exchange consequently the company may be required to dispose of these securities over a longer and potentially less favorable period of time than is required to dispose of the securities of exchange listed companies there is no minimum required market capitalization of the companies in which the company may invest and the company may invest a portion of its assets in securities of companies having smaller market capitalizations investments in companies with smaller market capitalizations are generally riskier than investments in larger wellestablished companies smaller companies often are more recently formed than larger companies and may have limited or less diverse product lines distribution channels and financial and managerial resources and narrower market penetration there is often less publicly available information about these companies than there is for larger more established issuers making it more difficult for the adviser to analyze the value of the company the equity securities of smaller companies are often traded overthecounter or on regional exchanges and may not be traded in the volume typical for securities that are traded on a national securities exchange consequently the company may be required to sell these securities over a longer period of time and potentially at less favorable prices than would be the case for securities of larger companies in addition the prices of the securities of smaller companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies bonds and other fixedincome securities the company may invest a portion of its assets in bonds and other fixedincome securities when in the judgment of the adviser subject to any policies established by the board of managers such investments are warranted in addition the company may invest without limit in high quality fixedincome securities for temporary defensive purposes and to maintain liquidity fixedincome securities include among other securities bonds notes and debentures issued by corporations debt securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities us government securities or by a foreign government municipal securities and mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities these securities may pay fixed variable or floating rates of interest and may include zero coupon obligations fixedincome securities are subject to the risk of the issuers inability to meet principal and interest payments on its obligations ie credit risk and are subject to price volatility due to such factors as interest rate sensitivity market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity ie market risk the company may invest in both investment grade and noninvestment grade debt securities investment grade debt securities are securities that have received a rating from at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro in one of the four highest rating categories or if not rated by any nrsro have been determined by the adviser to be of comparable quality noninvestment grade debt  a      securities typically called junk bonds are securities that have received a rating from a nrsro of below investment grade or have been given no rating and are considered by the nrsro to be predominantly speculative with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal noninvestment grade debt securities in the lowest rating categories may involve a substantial risk of default or may be in default adverse changes in economic conditions or developments regarding the individual issuer are more likely to cause price volatility and weaken the capacity of the issuers of noninvestment grade debt securities to make principal and interest payments than is the case for higher grade debt securities an economic downturn affecting an issuer of noninvestment grade debt securities may result in an increased incidence of default in addition the market for lower grade debt securities may be thinner and less active than for higher grade debt securities limited diversification the company is a nondiversified investment company thus there are no limitations on the percentage of the companys assets that may be invested in the securities of any one issuer to the extent that a relatively high percentage of the companys assets are invested in the securities of a limited number of issuers within one or more sectors the companys investment portfolio will be more susceptible to risk of loss from events affecting particular issuers as well as from economic political or regulatory events than the portfolio of a diversified investment company or an investment company not focused on investments in securities of issuers in those sectors any investment in the company for this reason may be subject to greater risk and volatility than if investments were made in the securities of a broader range of issuers the company generally intends to invest no more than  of the value of its total assets unleveraged and measured at the time of purchase in the securities of any one issuer the company will not invest  or more of the value of its total assets in the securities other than us government securities of issuers engaged in any single industry however it may invest  or more of its assets in securities of issuers engaged in related industries within a particular sector including industries related to identical products such related industries may be similarly affected by a single economic political or regulatory event or development affecting their common products risk of netlong bias the companys portfolio may operate with a netlong bias ie the dollar value of long positions in the portfolio exceed the dollar value of short positions as a result in a declining equity market environment operating with a netlong bias could subject the companys portfolio to more downside volatility than would be the case if the companys portfolio had greater short exposure foreign securities emerging markets currency risks the company will invest a significant portion of its net assets in securities of foreign issuers and in depositary receipts that represent indirect interests in securities of foreign issuers foreign securities in which the company may invest may be listed on foreign securities exchanges or traded in foreign overthecounter  a      markets the adviser defines foreign issuers as companies that derive a majority of their revenue or profits from foreign businesses investments or sales or that have a majority of their operations or assets located outside of the us since there are companies that may be legally organized or have principal offices located in the us that derive a majority of their revenue or profits from foreign businesses investments or sales or that have a majority of their operations or assets located outside the us such companies are also considered to be foreign issuers for these purposes investments in foreign securities are affected by risk factors generally not thought to be present in the us these factors include but are not limited to the following varying custody brokerage and settlement practices difficulty in pricing less public information about issuers of foreign securities less governmental regulation and supervision over the issuance and trading of securities than in the us the unavailability of financial information regarding the foreign issuer or the difficulty of interpreting financial information prepared under foreign accounting standards less liquidity and more volatility in foreign securities markets the possibility of expropriation or nationalization the imposition of withholding and other taxes on interest dividends capital gains or other income adverse political social or diplomatic developments limitations on the movement of funds or other assets of the company between different countries difficulties in invoking legal process abroad and enforcing contractual obligations and the difficulty of assessing economic trends in foreign countries moreover governmental issuers of foreign securities may be unwilling to repay principal and interest due and may require that the conditions for payment be renegotiated investment in foreign countries also involves higher brokerage and custodian expenses than does investment in us securities other risks of investing in foreign securities include changes in currency exchange rates in the case of securities that are not denominated in us dollars and currency exchange control regulations or other foreign or us laws or restrictions or devaluations of foreign currencies a decline in the exchange rate would reduce the value of certain of the companys foreign currency denominated portfolio securities irrespective of the performance of the underlying investment in addition the company may incur costs in connection with conversion between various currencies the foregoing risks may be greater in emerging industrialized and less developed countries foreign currency transactions the adviser may engage in foreign currency transactions for a variety of purposes including to fix in us dollars the value of a security the company has agreed to buy or sell between trade and settlement date or to hedge the us dollar value of securities the company already owns particularly if the adviser expects a decrease in the value of the currency in which the foreign security is denominated foreign currency transactions may involve for example the purchase of foreign currencies for us dollars or the maintenance of short positions in foreign currencies which would involve the company agreeing to exchange an amount of a currency it did not currently own for another currency at a future date in anticipation of a decline in the value of the currency sold relative to the currency the company contracted to  a      receive in the exchange the advisers success in these transactions will depend principally on its ability to predict accurately the future exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar the frequency with which the company may engage in such foreign currency transactions will depend on the level of investment by the company in such foreign securities the company may enter into forward currency exchange contracts forward contracts for hedging purposes and nonhedging purposes to pursue its investment objective forward contracts are transactions involving the companys obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date at a specified price forward contracts may be used by the company for hedging purposes to protect against uncertainty in the level of future foreign currency exchange rates such as when the company anticipates purchasing or selling a foreign security this technique would allow the company to lock in the currency price of the security forward contracts may also be used to attempt to protect the value of the companys existing holdings of foreign securities there may be however imperfect correlation between the companys foreign securities holdings and the forward contracts entered into with respect to those holdings forward contracts may also be used for nonhedging purposes to pursue the companys investment objective subject to any policies established by the board of managers such as when the adviser anticipates that particular foreign currencies will appreciate or depreciate in value even though securities denominated in those currencies are not then held in the companys investment portfolio there is no requirement that the company hedge all or any portion of its exposure to foreign currency risks leverage the company may borrow money to purchase securities a practice known as leverage which involves certain risks in this regard the company may make margin purchases of securities borrow money from banks and enter into reverse repurchase agreements the company may also borrow money for temporary or emergency purposes or in connection with the repurchase of interests trading equity securities on margin generally involves an initial cash requirement representing at least  of the underlying securitys value with respect to transactions in us markets and varying typically lower percentages with respect to transactions in foreign markets borrowings to purchase equity securities typically will be secured by the pledge of those securities the financing of securities purchases may also be effected through reverse repurchase agreements with banks brokers and other financial institutions this involves the transfer by the company of the underlying security to a counterparty in exchange for cash proceeds based on a percentage which can be as high as  to  of the value of the debt instrument although leverage will increase investment return if the company earns a greater return on the investments purchased with borrowed funds than it pays for the use of those funds the use of leverage will decrease investment return if the company fails to earn as much on investments purchased with borrowed funds as it pays for the use of those funds the use of leverage will therefore magnify the volatility of the value of the companys investment portfolio in the event that the companys equity or debt instruments decline in value the company could be subject to a margin call or collateral call pursuant to which the company must either deposit additional collateral with the lender or suffer mandatory liquidation of the pledged securities to  a      compensate for the decline in value in the event of a sudden precipitous drop in value of the companys assets the company might not be able to liquidate assets quickly enough to pay off its borrowing money borrowed for leveraging will be subject to interest costs that may or may not be recovered by return on the securities purchased the company also may be required to maintain minimum average balances in connection with its borrowings or to pay a commitment or other fee to maintain a line of credit either of these requirements would increase the cost of borrowing over the stated interest rate the  act requires the company to satisfy an asset coverage requirement of  of its indebtedness including amounts borrowed measured at the time the company incurs the indebtedness the asset coverage requirement this means that the value of the companys total indebtedness may not exceed onethird the value of its total assets including such indebtedness measured at the time the company incurs the indebtedness the staff of the securities and exchange commissions division of investment management the sec staff takes the position that short sales of securities reverse repurchase agreements use of margin sales of put and call options on specific securities or indices investments in certain other types of instruments including certain derivatives such as swap agreements and the purchase and sale of securities on a whenissued or forward commitment basis may be deemed to constitute indebtedness subject to the asset coverage requirement the sec staff has stated however that it will not deem a portfolio position involving these instruments to be subject to the asset coverage requirement if an investment company covers its position by segregating liquid securities on its books or in an account with its custodian in amounts sufficient to offset the liability associated with the position generally in conjunction with portfolio positions that are deemed to constitute senior securities the company must  observe the asset coverage requirement  maintain daily a segregated account in cash or liquid securities at such a level that the amount segregated plus any amounts pledged to a broker as collateral will equal the current value of the position or  otherwise cover the portfolio position with offsetting portfolio securities segregation of assets or covering portfolio positions with offsetting portfolio securities may limit the companys ability to otherwise invest those assets or dispose of those securities in order to obtain leveraged market exposure in certain investments and to increase the overall return to the company of various investments the company may purchase options and other synthetic instruments that do not constitute indebtedness for purposes of the asset coverage requirement these instruments may nevertheless involve significant economic leverage and therefore may in some cases involve significant risks of loss short sales the company may attempt to limit exposure to a possible market decline in the value of its portfolio securities through short sales of securities that the adviser subject to any policies established by the board of managers believes possess volatility characteristics similar to those being hedged in addition the company may use short sales for nonhedging purposes to pursue its investment objective for example the company may short a security of a company if the adviser believes the security is overvalued in relation to the issuers prospects for earnings growth  a      to effect a short sale the company will borrow a security from a brokerage firm to make delivery to the buyer the company is then obligated to replace the borrowed security by purchasing it at the market price at the time of replacement the company will realize a gain if the borrowed security declines in price between the date of the short sale and the date on which the company replaces the security the company will incur a loss if the price of the borrowed security increases between those dates this loss can increase rapidly and without effective limit the amount of any gain will be decreased and the amount of any loss increased by the amount of any premium or interest the company may be required to pay in connection with a short sale there is a risk that the borrowed securities would need to be returned to the brokerage firm on short notice if a request for return of securities occurs at a time when other short sellers of the subject security are receiving similar requests a short squeeze can occur and the company might be compelled at the most disadvantageous time to replace borrowed securities previously sold short with purchases on the open market possibly at prices significantly in excess of the price at which the securities were sold short the successful use of short selling may be adversely affected by imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the security sold short and the securities being hedged short selling may exaggerate the volatility of the companys investment portfolio short selling may also produce higher than normal portfolio turnover and may result in increased transaction costs to the company the company may also make short sales againstthebox in which it sells short securities it owns or has the right to obtain without payment of additional consideration if the company makes a short sale againstthebox it will be required to set aside securities equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short or securities convertible or exchangeable into those securities and will be required to hold those securities while the short sale is outstanding the company will incur transaction costs including interest expenses in connection with opening maintaining and closing short sales againstthebox incentive allocation the special allocation of  of net profits to the special advisory account of the special advisory member as defined below may create an incentive for the adviser to cause the company to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of the incentive allocation defined below in addition because the allocation is calculated on a basis that includes unrealized appreciation of the companys assets the incentive allocation may be greater than if it were based solely on realized gains the overall amounts payable by the company and its members which include the management fee and the incentive allocation will be higher than those paid by most other registered investment companies but will be generally similar to those paid by many private funds with similar investment policies limited liquidity inkind distributions an investment in the company provides only limited liquidity because members are not able to redeem interests on a daily basis in addition with very limited exceptions interests are not transferable and liquidity will be provided only through repurchase offers made from time to time by the company the adviser expects that it will recommend to the board of managers that the company offer to repurchase interests from   a      members four times each year however there is no requirement that repurchase offers be made and it is possible that any repurchase offer that is made will be oversubscribed in which event the company will purchase only a pro rata portion of the interest or portion of an interest tendered by each member the company will be dissolved if any member has submitted a written request to the company for the repurchase of the members interest and that interest is not repurchased by the company within two years a member may thus not be able to liquidate an investment in the company for a period of up to two years an investment in the company is therefore suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with the limited liquidity of interests and should be viewed as a longterm investment payment for repurchased interests may require the company to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than the adviser would otherwise liquidate these holdings potentially resulting in losses and may increase the companys portfolio turnover the adviser intends to take measures subject to such policies

that entitle the holder to a pro rata share of the profits if any of the entity without preference over any other shareholder or claim of shareholders after making required payments to holders of the entitys preferred stock and other senior equity common stock usually carries with it the right to vote and frequently an exclusive right to do so preferred stock preferred stock generally has a preference as to dividends and upon the event of liquidation over an issuers common stock but it ranks junior to debt securities in an issuers capital structure preferred stock generally pays dividends in cash or additional shares of preferred stock at a defined rate but unlike interest payments on debt securities preferred stock dividends are payable only if declared by the issuers board of directors dividends on preferred stock may be cumulative meaning that in the event the issuer fails to make one or more dividend payments on the preferred stock no dividends may be paid on the issuers common stock until all unpaid preferred stock dividends have been paid preferred stock may also be subject to optional or mandatory redemption provisions    b      convertible securities convertible securities are bonds debentures notes preferred stocks or other securities that may be converted into or exchanged for a specified amount of common stock of the same or different issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula a convertible security entitles the holder to receive interest that is generally paid or accrued on debt or a dividend that is paid or accrued on preferred stock until the convertible security matures or is redeemed converted or exchanged convertible securities have unique investment characteristics in that they generally  have higher yields than common stocks but lower yields than comparable nonconvertible securities  are less subject to fluctuation in value than the underlying common stock due to their fixedincome characteristics and  provide the potential for capital appreciation if the market price of the underlying common stock increases the value of a convertible security is a function of its investment value determined by its yield in comparison with the yields of other securities of comparable maturity and quality that do not have a conversion privilege and its conversion value the securitys worth at market value if converted into the underlying common stock the investment value of a convertible security is influenced by changes in interest rates with investment value declining as interest rates increase and increasing as interest rates decline the credit standing of the issuer and other factors may also have an effect on the convertible securitys investment value the conversion value of a convertible security is determined by the market price of the underlying common stock if the conversion value is low relative to the investment value the price of the convertible security is governed principally by its investment value generally the conversion value decreases as the convertible security approaches maturity to the extent the market price of the underlying common stock approaches or exceeds the conversion price the price of the convertible security will be increasingly influenced by its conversion value a convertible security generally will sell at a premium over its conversion value by the extent to which investors place value on the right to acquire the underlying common stock while holding a fixedincome security a convertible security may be subject to redemption at the option of the issuer at a price established in the convertible securitys governing instrument if a convertible security held by the company is called for redemption the company will be required to permit the issuer to redeem the security convert it into the underlying common stock or sell it to a third party any of these actions could have an adverse effect on the companys ability to achieve its investment objective repurchase agreements repurchase agreements are agreements under which the company purchases securities from a bank that is a member of the federal reserve system a foreign bank or a securities dealer that agrees to repurchase the securities from the company at a higher price on a designated future date if the seller under a repurchase agreement becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to repurchase the securities the company would have the right to sell the securities this right however may be restricted or the value of the securities may   b      decline before the securities can be liquidated in the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the securities before the repurchase of the securities under a repurchase agreement is accomplished the company may encounter a delay and incur costs including a decline in the value of the securities before being able to sell the securities repurchase agreements that are subject to foreign law may not enjoy protections comparable to those provided to certain repurchase agreements under us bankruptcy law and they therefore may involve greater risks the company has adopted specific policies designed to minimize certain of the risks of loss from its use of repurchase agreements which may include counterparty risks similar to those described below see counterparty risks reverse repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements involve the companys sale of a security to a bank or securities dealer and the companys simultaneous agreement to repurchase that security for a fixed price reflecting a market rate of interest on a specific date these transactions involve a risk that the other party to a reverse repurchase agreement will be unable or unwilling to complete the transaction as scheduled which may result in losses to the company reverse repurchase transactions are a form of leverage that may increase the volatility of the companys investment portfolio the company has adopted policies designed to minimize certain of the risks of loss associated with reverse repurchase transactions purchasing initial public offerings the company may purchase securities of companies in initial public offerings or shortly thereafter special risks associated with these securities may include a limited number of shares available for trading unseasoned trading lack of investor knowledge of the issuer and limited operating history these factors may contribute to substantial price volatility for the shares of these companies the limited number of shares available for trading in some initial public offerings may make it more difficult for the company to buy or sell significant amounts of shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices in addition some companies in initial public offerings are involved in relatively new industries or lines of business which may not be widely understood by investors some of these companies may be undercapitalized or regarded as developmental stage companies without revenues or operating income or the nearterm prospects of achieving them special investment instruments and techniques the company may utilize a variety of special investment instruments and techniques described below to hedge its investment portfolio against various risks such as changes in interest rates or other factors that affect security values or for nonhedging purposes to pursue the companys investment objective these strategies may be executed through derivative transactions the instruments the company may use and the  b      particular manner in which they may be used may change over time as new instruments and techniques are developed or regulatory changes occur certain of the special investment instruments and techniques that the company may use are speculative and involve a high degree of risk particularly in the context of nonhedging transactions to pursue the companys investment objective there is no requirement that the company hedge its portfolio or any of its investment positions call and put options on individual securities the company may purchase call and put options in respect of specific securities and may write and sell covered or uncovered call and put options for hedging purposes and nonhedging purposes to pursue its investment objective a put option gives the purchaser of the option the right to sell and obligates the writer to buy the underlying security at a stated exercise price at any time prior to the expiration of the option similarly a call option gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and obligates the writer to sell the underlying security at a stated exercise price at any time prior to the expiration of the option a covered call option written by the company is a call option with respect to which the company owns the underlying security the sale of such an option exposes the company during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or to possible continued holding of a security that might otherwise have been sold to protect against depreciation in the market price of the security a covered put option written by the company is a put option with respect to which cash or liquid securities have been placed in a segregated account on the companys books or with the companys custodian to fulfill the obligation undertaken the sale of such an option exposes the company during the term of the option to a decline in price of the underlying security while depriving the company of the opportunity to invest the segregated assets the company may close out a position when writing options by purchasing an option on the same security with the same exercise price and expiration date as the option that it has previously written on the security the company will realize a profit or loss if the amount paid to purchase an option is less or more as the case may be than the amount received from the sale thereof to close out a position as a purchaser of an option the company would ordinarily make a similar closing sale transaction which involves liquidating the companys position by selling the option previously purchased although the company would be entitled to exercise the option should it deem it advantageous to do so the company may also invest in socalled synthetic options or other derivative instruments written by brokerdealers options transactions may be effected on securities exchanges or in the overthecounter market when options are purchased overthecounter the company bears the risk that the counterparty that wrote the option will be unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the option contract these options may also be illiquid and in such cases the company may have difficulty closing out its position overthecounter options purchased and sold by the company may also include options on baskets of specific securities  b      warrants and rights warrants are derivative instruments that permit but do not obligate the holder to subscribe for other securities or commodities rights are similar to warrants but normally have a shorter duration and are offered or distributed to shareholders of a company warrants and rights do not carry with them the right to dividends or voting rights with respect to the securities that they entitle the holder to purchase and they do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuer as a result warrants and rights may be considered more speculative than certain other types of equitylike securities in addition the values of warrants and rights do not necessarily change with the value of the underlying securities or commodities and these instruments cease to have value if they are not exercised prior to their expiration dates call and put options on securities indices the company may purchase and sell call and put options on stock indices such as the standard  poors  index listed on national securities exchanges or traded in the overthecounter market for hedging purposes and nonhedging purposes to pursue its investment objective a stock index fluctuates with changes in the market values of the stocks included in the index the effectiveness of purchasing or writing stock index options for hedging purposes will depend upon the extent to which price movements in the companys portfolio correlate with price movements of the stock index selected because the value of an index option depends upon movements in the level of the index rather than the price of a particular stock whether the company will realize a gain or loss from the purchase or writing of options on an index depends upon movements in the level of stock prices in the stock market generally or in the case of certain indexes in an industry or market segment rather than movements in the price of a particular stock accordingly successful use by the company of options on stock indexes will be subject to the advisers ability to predict correctly movements in the direction of the stock market generally or of a particular industry or market segment this requires different skills and techniques than predicting changes in the price of individual stocks additional derivative transactions the company may take advantage of opportunities in the area of swaps options on various underlying instruments swaptions and certain other customized derivative instruments  a swap is a contract under which two parties agree to make periodic payments to each other based on specified interest rates an index or the value of some other instrument applied to a stated or notional amount  swaps generally can be classified as interest rate swaps currency swaps commodity swaps or equity swaps depending on the type of index or instrument used to calculate the payments  such swaps would increase or decrease the companys investment exposure to the particular interest rate currency commodity or equity involved  the company may engage in swap transactions for single issuer equity replacement such transactions are undertaken to provide the company with exposure to a single security without having to receive exposure to a broader index in which such security may be found some of these securities are located in foreign markets where the company may not otherwise be able to purchase the foreign security directly notwithstanding the fact that the company will not directly hold the foreign security many of the risks associated with investments in foreign securities as described more fully under —foreign securities above may apply to swaps for such securities  b      certain equity placement swaps in which the company engages have the effect of providing economic leveraging of the companys assets such leverage can be significant as such the impact of an adverse change in the companys exposure may result in losses greater than the nominal value of the swap which can be significant under certain circumstances the company does not currently use derivatives to gain exposure to broad indices but uses standard put options on broad indices for hedging purposes the risks of such put options are described more fully under —special investment instruments and techniques – call and put options on securities indices above in addition the company may take advantage of opportunities with respect to certain other derivative instruments that are not presently contemplated for use by the company or that are currently not available but which may be developed to the extent such opportunities are both consistent with the companys investment objective and legally permissible for the company  special risks may apply to instruments that are invested in by the company in the future which risks cannot be determined at this time or until such instruments are developed or invested in by the company although not generally used by the company at present a swaption is an option entitling one party to enter into a swap agreement with the counterparty  in addition to swaps and swaptions the company may become a party to various other customized derivative instruments entitling the counterparty to certain payments on the gain or loss on the value of an underlying or referenced instrument  swaps options and other derivative instruments may be subject to various types of risks including market risk liquidity risk counterparty credit risk legal risk and operations risk each of which is described more fully herein under types of investments and related risk factors and additional risk factors below  in addition as noted above derivatives can involve significant economic leverage and may in some cases involve significant risks of loss lending portfolio securities the company may lend its portfolio securities to domestic and foreign brokers dealers and financial institutions these loans will be secured by collateral consisting of cash us government securities or irrevocable letters of credit maintained in an amount equal to at least  of the market value determined daily of the loaned securities the company may at any time call the loan and obtain the return of the securities loaned the company will be entitled to payments equal to the interest and dividends on the loaned security and may receive a premium for lending the securities lending portfolio securities may result in income to the company but there may be delays in the recovery of the loaned securities or a loss of rights in the collateral supplied should the borrower fail financially securities lending involves a form of leverage and the company may incur a loss if securities purchased with the collateral from securities loans decline in value  b      whenissued and forward commitment securities the company may purchase securities on a whenissued basis and may purchase or sell securities on a forward commitment basis in order to hedge against anticipated changes in interest rates and prices these transactions involve a commitment by the company to purchase or sell securities at a future date ordinarily one or two months later the price of the underlying securities which is generally expressed in terms of yield is fixed at the time the commitment is made but delivery and payment for the securities takes place at a later date no income accrues on securities that have been purchased pursuant to a forward commitment or on a whenissued basis prior to delivery to the company whenissued securities and forward commitments may be sold prior to the settlement date if the company disposes of the right to acquire a whenissued security prior to its acquisition or disposes of its right to deliver or receive against a forward commitment it may incur a gain or loss these transactions will be subject to the companys limitation on indebtedness unless at the time the company enters into such a transaction a segregated account consisting of cash us government securities or liquid securities equal to the value of the whenissued or forward commitment securities is established and maintained there is a risk that securities purchased on a whenissued basis may not be delivered and that the purchaser of securities sold by the company on a forward basis will not honor its purchase obligation in these cases the company may incur a loss counterparty risks counterparty and service provider relationships the company has established relationships to obtain brokerage prime brokerage custody and banking services financing and derivative intermediation and to act as counterparty to derivative transactions however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such relationships or establish others an inability to establish or maintain such relationships would limit the companys trading activities and prevent the company from trading at optimal rates and terms could create losses preclude the company from engaging in certain transactions concentrate the holdings of the assets of the company with a limited number of counterparties and limit the availability of financing to the company moreover a disruption in the services provided by any such relationships before the company is able to establish additional relationships which may not be successful could have a significant impact on the companys business due to the companys reliance on such counterparties creditworthiness of prime brokers and other service providers the company has established relationships with brokerdealers banks and their affiliates both in the us and outside the us for the provision of services including holding and maintaining the funds securities commodity interests and other property of the company and the clearance of the companys securities transactions the company has entered into prime brokerage relationships with several financial institutions that provide clearing financing settlement and other related services to the company these arrangements can cover securities loans derivatives options and futures foreign exchange and securities lending transactions and usually involve the provision of financing to the company the companys assets held by a prime broker that is providing financing generally will be secured in favor of that prime broker and its affiliates  b      although the company generally engages us brokerdealers as its prime brokers the prime brokerage arrangements will include contractual relationships within a prime brokers group of affiliates some of which may be located outside of the united states however the companys prime brokerage arrangements will allow for transfer of the companys assets to the prime brokers affiliates and also to subcustodians which may be located in various jurisdictions including jurisdictions outside the united states these entities may hold securities commodities cash collateral or other assets of the company in such jurisdictions as may be necessary to facilitate the provision of the services to the company the agreements with the financial institutions are also complex and generally include crosscollateral netting and crossdefault provisions to protect the financial institution from the failure of the company to meet its obligations under a variety of agreements bankruptcy laws and other laws and regulations relating to the protection of assets of the company held by the financial institution vary substantially by jurisdiction type of legal entity and are very complex and uncertain and can involve the risk of loss or inability to access any or all of the assets of the company held by a financial institution that becomes subject to the bankruptcy or insolvency regime company assets may be held with us brokerdealers or us or nonus banks or their affiliates and the risks associated with assets held at each of these various institutions may differ substantially while there are various laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that may provide some protection to customers of brokerage firms and commercial banks in the event of their insolvency these protections are not uniform across jurisdictions and it is not always clear when such protections may apply the effect of these laws and their application to the companys assets are subject to substantial limitations and uncertainties particularly in the event of insolvency or other similar events even in countries where applicable law provides protection to assets of clients such protections may not adequately protect the company from risk of loss for example while us rules and regulations applicable to brokerdealers are designed to protect client assets including the companys assets it is possible that if one of the companys brokers were to become insolvent the assets of the company held at such broker could be at risk while us brokerdealers are required to segregate client assets from their proprietary assets and are required to hold specified amounts of capital in reserve client assets are normally held in pooled client accounts for the benefit of all clients additionally the broker may be able to transfer client assets out of such client accounts or use such assets including cash in the ordinary course of its business the company could experience losses if the clients claims exceed the amount of client assets such brokers actually held at the time of the insolvency with respect to us brokerdealers in the event client claims are greater than client property the clients remaining claims may be satisfied along with all general unsecured claims from the brokers noncustomer assets including its regulatory capital in addition while the return of client property is designed to occur on an expedited basis usually by transfer of the accounts to a solvent broker there exists the risk of delay in or inability to make such a return or transfer in whole or in part by the insolvent broker furthermore the company may be unable to trade such securities or other property held by the insolvent broker during this transfer period or during a pending insolvency proceeding such a situation would create the possibility of a substantial loss to the company with respect to its assets held at such broker since the amount and type of property ultimately received by the company may remain indeterminate until actually returned or upon resolution of any insolvency proceeding as applicable the company may be unable to adequately hedge its positions in such property  b      in light of the extensive and sometimes complex financing and trading arrangements that the company has with its prime brokers the company faces the risks among other things that the assets of the company might be transferred out of its accounts or might be in accounts which do not benefit from client asset protection or that a prime broker will have a security interest in the assets of the company that it holds because of the large number of entities and jurisdictions involved and the range of possible factual scenarios involving the insolvency of a prime broker or any of its subcustodians agents or affiliates it is impossible to generalize about the effect of their insolvency on the company and its assets investors should assume that the insolvency of any of the companys prime brokers could result in the loss of all or a substantial portion of the companys assets held by such prime broker whether as a result of losing a proprietary interest in any of its assets a substantial delay which could be years in their return or the uncertain outcome of pursuing a claim as a creditor in an insolvency should the company be unable to identify access or value its assets or establish with any certainty the amount or likelihood of recovery of any claim such circumstances could cause substantial losses to the company such losses might not be limited to the assets that were held by that prime broker including replacement costs of relevant assets and fees and expenses moreover the company might be required to make future payments or deliveries to the insolvent prime broker without setoff of amounts due to it the failure of a prime broker could have a material adverse effect on the company although the company evaluates the creditworthiness of the companys prime brokers and other service providers it is often impossible to obtain sufficient information to make fullyinformed judgments or determinations of the risk that a particular financial institution may fail particularly given the speed with which a financial institutions creditworthiness may decline when faced with liquidity pressures strategies to minimize such risk include moving assets from one prime broker to another prime broker custodian or bank or establishing segregated accounts for securities if possible which creates additional operational risk the company currently relies on its prime brokers to provide financing for many of its investment activities financial institutions may reevaluate their prime brokerage business from time to time which may impact the availability of credit to the company and the terms on which it is offered including the cost thereof creating a more difficult financing environment for many asset classes and this may potentially adversely affect the companys returns and investment activity in addition the company may face an increased risk of being subject to significant changes in margin requirements as prime brokers modify their risk models to determine how much to lend to their customers furthermore prime brokers may face additional regulation in the foreseeable future which may affect their willingness or ability to provide prime brokerage services and the costs of such services financing costs are likely to be significantly higher or assets may become impossible to finance if they cannot be financed by prime brokers counterparty default the company may enter into many transactions including derivatives and overthecounter instruments securities options futures foreign exchange and securities lending transactions with or through third parties generally the company will not be restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty the company is always subject to the risk that a counterparty may not timely settle a  b      transaction perform its obligations in accordance with contractual terms and conditions or otherwise not perform its obligations to make due payment or delivery thus causing the company to suffer a loss which may be material moreover for many transactions the company is required to post collateral to its counterparty and a failure of that counterparty or its affiliates could result in a loss of that collateral in the event that a counterparty defaults on its obligations for any reason the company may incur replacement costs of transactions losses associated with other assets which the failed transaction was intended to hedge and fees and expenses in seeking redress which may be uncertain in outcome such counterparty risk may be accentuated for contracts with longer maturities where events may intervene to preclude settlement or performance or where the company has concentrated its transactions with a single or small group of counterparties failure of counterparties to settle transactions or perform their obligations to make due payment and delivery could have a material adverse effect on the company furthermore any misconduct on behalf of counterparties including without limitation fraudulent activities will increase the companys exposure to risk of loss restricted and illiquid investments although the company invests primarily in publicly traded securities it may invest a portion of the value of its total assets in restricted securities and other investments that are illiquid restricted securities are securities that may not be sold to the public without an effective registration statement under the securities act of  as amended the  act or if they are unregistered may be sold only in a privately negotiated transaction or pursuant to an exemption from registration in recognition of the increased size and liquidity of the institutional markets for unregistered securities and the importance of institutional investors in the formation of capital the securities and exchange commission the sec has adopted rule a under the  act which is designed to further facilitate efficient trading among qualified institutional investors by permitting the sale of certain unregistered securities to qualified institutional buyers to the extent privately placed securities held by the company qualify under rule a and an institutional market develops for those securities the company likely will be able to dispose of the securities without registering them under the  act to the extent that qualified institutional buyers become for a time uninterested in purchasing these securities investing in rule a securities could have the effect of increasing the level of the companys illiquidity the company may adopt procedures under which certain rule a securities will not be deemed to be illiquid if certain criteria are satisfied with respect to those securities and the market therefor foreign securities that can be freely sold in the markets in which they are principally traded are not considered by the company to be restricted or illiquid regulation s under the  act permits the sale abroad of securities that are not registered for sale in the united states repurchase agreements with maturities of more than seven days will be treated as illiquid where registration is required to sell a security the company may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a considerable period may elapse between the decision to sell and the time the company may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement if during such period adverse market conditions were to develop the company might obtain a less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to sell restricted securities for which no market exists and other illiquid investments are valued at fair value as determined in accordance with procedures approved and periodically reviewed by the board of managers  b      restricted securities and other illiquid investments involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the adviser or at prices approximating the value at which the company is carrying the securities as a result in determining the proportion of the value of its total assets that will be invested in restricted and other illiquid investments the company will consider the need to maintain an adequate level of liquidity in its portfolio in order to fund the repurchase of interests from members without unnecessarily adversely impacting the value of the companys portfolio it is not expected that the company will invest all or a substantial portion of the value of its total assets in such restricted or other illiquid investments temporary investments us government securities risk during periods of adverse market conditions in the equity securities markets or otherwise for defensive purposes the company may temporarily invest all or a substantial portion of its assets in high quality fixedincome securities including money market instruments or may temporarily hold cash or cash equivalents in such amounts as the adviser deems appropriate under the circumstances securities will be deemed to be of high quality if they are rated in the top four categories by an nrsro or if unrated are determined to be of comparable quality by the adviser money market instruments are high quality shortterm debt obligations which generally have remaining maturities of one year or less and may include us government securities commercial paper certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances issued by domestic branches of united states banks that are members of the federal deposit insurance corporation and repurchase agreements for us government securities in lieu of purchasing money market instruments the company may purchase shares of money market mutual funds that invest primarily in us government securities and repurchase agreements involving those securities subject to certain limitations imposed by the  act the company may also invest in money market instruments or purchase shares of money market mutual funds pending investment of its assets in equity securities or nonmoney market debt securities or to maintain such liquidity as may be necessary to effect repurchases of interests from members or for other purposes it is possible that the us government would not provide financial support to its agencies or instrumentalities if it were not required to do so by law if a us government agency or instrumentality in which the company invests defaults and the us government does not stand behind the obligation the value of the companys investment portfolio could fall the us governments guarantee of ultimate payment of principal and timely payment of interest of the us government securities owned by the company does not imply that the interests are guaranteed by the fdic or any other government agency or that the value of the interests will not continue to fluctuate distributions to members and payment of tax liability the company does not intend to make periodic distributions of its net income or gains if any to members whether or not distributions are made members will be required each year to pay applicable federal state and local income taxes on their respective shares of the companys taxable income and will have to pay applicable taxes from other sources the amount and times of any distributions will be determined in the sole discretion of the board of managers  b      experience and location of the adviser the adviser was relatively recently organized in  and has not previously managed the investment portfolio of a registered investment company however the companys portfolio manager is experienced in portfolio management additionally the adviser has all or a substantial part of its assets located outside of the united states as a result it may be difficult for us investors to enforce judgments of the courts of the united states against the adviser predicated solely on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws  item  management the identity of and brief biographical information regarding each manager is set forth below name address and age   positions held with the company and length of time served   principal occupations during past  years number of portfolios overseen in company complex and other directorships held     each manager was elected to serve as a manager by the initial member of the company the managers serve on the board for terms of indefinite duration a managers position in that capacity will terminate if the manager is removed resigns or is subject to various disabling events such as death incapacity or bankruptcy a manager may resign subject to giving not less than  days prior written notice to the other managers and may be removed either by vote of twothirds  of the managers not subject to the removal vote or by a vote of members holding not less than twothirds  of the total number of votes eligible to be cast by all members in the event of any vacancy in the position of a manager the remaining managers may appoint an individual to serve as a manager so long as immediately after the appointment at least twothirds  of the managers then serving have been elected by the members the board of managers may call a meeting of members to fill any vacancy in the position of a manager and must do so within  days after any date on which managers who were elected by the members cease to constitute a majority of the managers then serving each independent manager is paid by the company an annual retainer of  and permeeting fees of  for attendance at inperson meetings the independent managers are reimbursed by the company for their reasonable outofpocket expenses the managers do not receive any pension or retirement benefits from the company  b      the board of managers has formed an audit committee comprised of the independent managers the functions of which are i to oversee the companys accounting and financial reporting policies and practices its internal controls and as the audit committee may deem necessary or appropriate the internal controls of certain service providers ii to oversee the quality and objectivity of the companys financial statements and the independent audit thereof and iii to the extent there are managers who are not members of the audit committee to act as a liaison between the companys independent auditors and the board of managers as the company is newly organized the audit committee did not hold any meetings during the last fiscal year the board of managers has also formed a nominating committee comprised of the independent managers for the purpose of selecting and nominating persons to serve in the capacity of independent manager as the company is newly organized the nominating committee did not hold any meetings during the last fiscal year the nominating committee does not consider nominees recommended by members the company has not yet commenced operations therefore none of the managers own interests as of the end of the most recently completed calendar year no independent manager owned equity securities in any registered investment company overseen by that manager in the same family of investment companies as the company the board of managers has delegated responsibility for management of the companys investments and management of the companys daytoday operations to the adviser item  control persons and principal holders of securities as the sole member of the registrant graeme white is deemed to be a control person of the registrant in addition by virtue of mr white being an officer of the adviser the adviser may be deemed a control person of the registrant however mr white shall withdraw from the company immediately preceding the commencement of operations of the company and thus at such time the adviser would no longer be deemed a control person of the registrant for purposes of this item control means  the beneficial ownership either directly or through one or more controlled companies of more than  percent of the voting securities of a company  the acknowledgment or assertion by either the controlled or controlling party of the existence of control or  an adjudication under section a of the  act which has become final that control exists  b      item  investment advisory and other services the adviser was incorporated under the laws of england and wales as a limited liability partnership on august   and is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  as amended the advisers act the adviser provides investment advisory services to other private investment vehicles and client accounts the offices of the adviser are located at  berkeley street london wj ed england and its telephone number is  the adviser and the companies controlling the adviser may be deemed to control the company as such term is defined by the  act the custodian   serves as custodian for the assets of the company the custodians principal business address is   the board of managers has selected     as the independent registered public accounting firm of the company  s principal business address is located at   item  portfolio managers reza amiri is primarily responsible for the daytoday management of the companys portfolio subject to such policies as may be adopted by its board of managers   other funds and accounts managed the following tables set forth information about funds and accounts other than the company for which mr amiri is primarily responsible for the daytoday portfolio management as of december   registered investment companies managed  pooled vehicles managed other accounts managed number total assets number total assets number total assets

performancebased fees total assets with performancebased fees number with performance based fees total assets with performance based fees             compensation program   to be completed by amendment potential material conflicts of interest real potential or apparent conflicts of interest may arise should mr amiri have daytoday portfolio management responsibilities with respect to more than one fund mr amiri may manage other accounts with investment strategies similar to the company including other investment companies pooled investment vehicles and separately managed accounts fees earned by the adviser may vary among these accounts and mr amiri may personally invest in these accounts these factors could create conflicts of interest because mr amiri may have incentives to favor certain accounts over others that could result in other accounts outperforming the company a conflict may also exist if mr amiri identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be appropriate for more than one account but the company is not able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to the need to allocate that opportunity among multiple accounts in addition mr amiri may execute transactions for another account that may adversely impact the value of securities held by the company however the adviser believes that these risks are mitigated by the fact that accounts with like investment strategies managed by mr amiri are generally managed in a similar fashion and the adviser has a policy that seeks to allocate opportunities on a fair and equitable basis fund ownership   as of the date of this registration statement mr amiri does not own interests item  brokerage allocation and other practices the adviser is responsible for placing orders for the execution of the companys portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage transactions on us stock exchanges and on some foreign stock exchanges involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions on many foreign stock exchanges commissions are fixed no stated commission is generally applicable to securities traded in overthecounter markets but the prices of those securities include undisclosed commissions or markups  b      in selecting brokers and dealers to effect transactions on behalf of the company the adviser seeks to obtain the best price and execution taking into account factors such as price size of order difficulty of execution and operational facilities of a brokerage firm reliability and financial stability and in the case of transactions effected by the company with unaffiliated brokers the firms risk in positioning a block of securities although the adviser generally seeks reasonably competitive commission rates the company does not necessarily pay the lowest commission available on each transaction the company has no obligation to deal with any broker or group of brokers in executing transactions in portfolio securities consistent with the principle of seeking best price and execution the adviser may place orders with brokers that provide the adviser or its affiliates supplemental research market and statistical information including advice as to the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities and the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities and furnishing analyses and reports concerning issuers industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts the expenses of the adviser are not necessarily reduced as a result of the receipt of this supplemental information which may be useful to the adviser or its affiliates in providing services to clients other than the company in addition not all of the supplemental information is used by the adviser in connection with the company conversely the information provided by brokers and dealers through which other clients of the adviser or its affiliates effect securities transactions may be useful to the adviser in providing services to the company it is expected that the company will actively and frequently trade securities and other investments in its portfolio and generally will have a high rate of portfolio turnover higher portfolio turnover rates usually generate additional brokerage commissions and expenses and the short term gains realized from these transactions are taxable to the members as ordinary income item  tax status tax elections returns tax audits the code generally provides for optional adjustments to the basis of partnership property upon distributions of partnership property to a partner and transfers of partnership interests including by reason of death provided that a partnership election has been made pursuant to section  under the company agreement at the request of a member the board of managers in its sole discretion may cause the company to make such an election any such election once made cannot be revoked without the services consent as a result of the complexity and added expense of the tax accounting required to implement such an election the board of managers presently does not intend to make such election  b      the board of managers decides how to report the partnership items on the companys tax returns in certain cases the company may be required to file a statement with the service disclosing one or more positions taken on its tax return generally where the tax law is uncertain or a position lacks clear authority all members are required under the code to treat the partnership items consistently on their own returns unless they file a statement with the service disclosing the inconsistency given the uncertainty and complexity of the tax laws it is possible that the service may not agree with the manner in which the companys items have been reported in the event the income tax returns of the company are audited by the service the tax treatment of the companys income and deductions generally is determined at the limited liability company level in a single proceeding rather than by individual audits of the members a member designated by the board of managers as the tax matters partner has considerable authority to make decisions affecting the tax treatment and procedural rights of all members in addition the tax matters partner has the authority to bind certain members to settlement agreements and the right on behalf of all members to extend the statute of limitations relating to the members tax liabilities with respect to company items mandatory basis adjustments the company is generally required to adjust its tax basis in its assets in respect of all members in cases of partnership distributions that result in a substantial basis reduction ie in excess of  in respect of the companys property the company is also required to adjust its tax basis in its assets in respect of a transferee in the case of a sale or exchange of an interest or a transfer upon death when there exists a substantial builtin loss ie in excess of  in respect of company property immediately after the transfer for this reason the company will require i a member who receives a distribution from the company in connection with a complete withdrawal ii a transferee of an interest including a transferee in case of death and iii any other member in appropriate circumstances to provide the company with information regarding its adjusted tax basis in its interest tax consequences to a withdrawing member a member receiving a cash liquidating distribution from the company in connection with a complete withdrawal from the company generally will recognize capital gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received by such member and such members adjusted tax basis in its interest such capital gain or loss will be shortterm longterm or some combination of both depending upon the timing of the members contributions to the company however a withdrawing member will recognize ordinary income to the extent such members allocable share of the companys unrealized receivables exceeds the members basis in such unrealized receivables as determined pursuant to the regulations for these purposes accrued but untaxed market discount if any on securities held by the company will be treated as an unrealized receivable with respect to which a withdrawing member would recognize ordinary income a member receiving a cash nonliquidating distribution will recognize income in a similar manner only to the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds such members adjusted tax basis in its interest  b      as discussed above the company agreement provides that the board of managers may specially allocate items of company ordinary income andor capital gain including shortterm capital gain and deductions ordinary loss andor capital loss including longterm capital loss to a withdrawing member or the special advisory member to the extent its capital account would otherwise exceed or be less than as the case may be its adjusted tax basis in its interest such a special allocation of income or gain may result in the withdrawing member recognizing ordinary income andor capital gain which may include shortterm capital gain in the members last taxable year in the company thereby reducing the amount of longterm capital gain recognized during the tax year in which it receives its liquidating distribution upon withdrawal such a special allocation of deduction or loss may result in the withdrawing member recognizing ordinary loss andor capital loss which may include longterm capital loss in the members last taxable year in the company thereby reducing the amount of shortterm capital loss recognized during the tax year in which it receives its liquidating distribution upon withdrawal distributions of property a partners receipt of a distribution of property from a partnership is generally not taxable however under section  of the code a distribution consisting of marketable securities generally is treated as a distribution of cash rather than property unless the distributing partnership is an investment partnership within the meaning of section cci and the recipient is an eligible partner within the meaning of section cciii the company will determine at the appropriate time whether it qualifies as an investment partnership assuming it so qualifies if a member is an eligible partner which term should include a member whose contributions to the company consisted solely of cash the rule treating a distribution of property as a distribution of cash would not apply tax treatment of company investments in general the company expects to act as a trader or investor and not as a dealer with respect to its securities transactions a trader and an investor are persons who buy and sell securities for their own accounts a dealer on the other hand is a person who purchases securities for resale to customers rather than for investment or speculation generally the gains and losses realized by a trader or an investor on the sale of securities are capital gains and losses capital gains and losses recognized by the company may be longterm or shortterm depending in general upon the length of time the company maintains a particular investment position and in some cases upon the nature of the transaction property held for more than one year generally will be eligible for longterm capital gain or loss treatment the application of certain rules relating to short sales to socalled straddle and wash sale transactions and to section  contracts defined below may serve to alter the treatment of the companys securities positions  b      the company may also realize ordinary income and losses with respect to its transactions the company may hold debt obligations with original issue discount in such case the company would be required to include amounts in taxable income on a current basis even though receipt of such amounts may occur in a subsequent year the maximum ordinary income tax rate for individuals is  and in general the maximum individual income tax rate for qualified dividends and longterm capital gains is  unless the taxpayer elects to be taxed at ordinary rates  see limitation on deductibility of interest and short sale expenses below although in all cases the actual rates may be higher due to the phase out of certain tax deductions exemptions and credits the excess of capital losses over capital gains may be offset against the ordinary income of an individual taxpayer subject to an annual deduction limitation of  capital losses of an individual taxpayer may generally be carried forward to succeeding tax years to offset capital gains and then ordinary income subject to the  annual limitation for corporate taxpayers the maximum income tax rate is  capital losses of a corporate taxpayer may be offset only against capital gains but unused capital losses may be carried back three years subject to certain limitations and carried forward five years in addition individuals estates and trusts are subject to a medicare tax of  on net investment income nii or undistributed nii in the case of estates and trusts for each such taxable year with such tax applying to the lesser of such income or the excess of such persons adjusted gross income with certain adjustments over a specified amount nii includes net income from interest dividends annuities royalties and rents and net gain attributable to the disposition of investment property it is generally anticipated that net income and gain attributable to an investment in the company will be included in an investors nii subject to this medicare tax however the calculation of nii for purposes of the medicare tax and taxable income for purposes of the regular income tax may be different furthermore the medicare tax and the regular income tax may be due in different taxable years with respect to the same income section  contracts in the case of section  contracts the code generally applies a marktomarket system of taxing unrealized gains and losses on such contracts and otherwise provides for special rules of taxation a section  contract includes certain regulated futures contracts and certain other contracts under these rules section  contracts held by the company at the end of each taxable year of the company are treated for federal income tax purposes as if they were sold by the company for their fair market value on the last business day of such taxable year the net gain or loss if any resulting from such deemed sales known as marking to market together with any gain or loss resulting from actual sales of section  contracts must be taken into account by the company in computing its taxable income for such year if a section  contract held by the company at the end of a taxable year is sold in the following year the amount of any gain or loss realized on such sale will be adjusted to reflect the gain or loss previously taken into account under the marktomarket rules  a qualified dividend is generally a dividend from certain domestic corporations and from certain foreign corporations that are either eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the united states or are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states shares must be held for certain holding periods in order for a dividend thereon to be a qualified dividend the amount is  for married individuals filing jointly  for married individuals filing separately  for other individuals and the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket for estates and trusts begins  b       with certain exceptions capital gains and losses from such section  contracts generally are characterized as shortterm capital gains or losses to the extent of  thereof and as longterm capital gains or losses to the extent of  thereof if an individual taxpayer incurs a net capital loss for a year the portion thereof if any which consists of a net loss on section  contracts may at the election of the taxpayer be carried back three years losses so carried back may be deducted only against net capital gain to the extent that such gain includes gains on section  contracts a section  contract does not include any securities futures contract or any option on such a contract other than a dealer securities futures contract see certain securities futures contracts certain securities futures contracts generally a securities futures contract is a contract of sale for future delivery of a single security or a narrowbased security index any gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a securities futures contract other than a dealer securities futures contract is treated as gain or loss from the sale or exchange of property that has the same character as the property to which the contract relates has or would have in the hands of the taxpayer if the underlying security would be a capital asset in the taxpayers hands then gain or loss from the sale or exchange of the securities futures contract would be capital gain or loss capital gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a securities futures contract to sell property ie the short side of a securities futures contract generally will be shortterm capital gain or loss a dealer securities futures contract is treated as a section  contract a dealer securities futures contract is a securities futures contract or an option to enter into such a contract that  is entered into by a dealer or in the case of an option is purchased or granted by the dealer in the normal course of its trade or business activity of dealing in the contracts and  is traded on a qualified board of trade or exchange mixed straddle election the code allows a taxpayer to elect to offset gains and losses from positions which are part of a mixed straddle a mixed straddle is any straddle in which one or more but not all positions are section  contracts pursuant to temporary regulations the company may be eligible to elect to establish one or more mixed straddle accounts for certain of its mixed straddle trading positions the mixed straddle account rules require a daily marking to market of all open positions in the account and a daily netting of gains and losses from positions in the account at the end of a taxable year the annual net gains or losses from the mixed straddle account are recognized for tax purposes the application of the temporary regulations mixed straddle account rules is not entirely clear therefore there is no assurance that a mixed straddle account election by the company will be accepted by the service possible marktomarket election to the extent that the company is directly engaged in a trade or business as a trader in securities it may elect under section  of the code to marktomarket the securities held in connection with such trade or business under such election securities held by the company at the end of each taxable year generally will be treated as if they were sold by the company for their fair market value on the last day of such taxable year and gains or losses recognized thereon with certain exceptions will be treated as ordinary income or loss moreover even if the company determines that its securities activities will constitute trading rather than investing there can be no assurance that the service will agree in which case the company may not be able to marktomarket its positions  b      short sales gain or loss from a short sale of property is generally considered as capital gain or loss to the extent the property used to close the short sale constitutes a capital asset in the companys hands except with respect to certain situations where the property used to close a short sale has a longterm holding period on the date the short sale is entered into gains on short sales generally are shortterm capital gains a loss on a short sale will be treated as a longterm capital loss if on the date of the short sale substantially identical property has been held by the company for more than one year in addition these rules may also terminate the running of the holding period of substantially identical property held by the company gain or loss on a short sale will generally not be realized until such time that the short sale is closed however if the company holds a short sale position with respect to stock certain debt obligations or partnership interests that has appreciated in value and then acquires property that is the same as or substantially identical to the property sold short the company generally will recognize gain on the date it acquires such property as if the short sale were closed on such date with such property similarly if the company holds an appreciated financial position with respect to stock certain debt obligations or partnership interests and then enters into a short sale with respect to the same or substantially identical property the company generally will recognize gain as if the appreciated financial position were sold at its fair market value on the date it enters into the short sale the subsequent holding period for any appreciated financial position that is subject to these constructive sale rules will be determined as if such position were acquired on the date of the constructive sale effect of straddle rules on members securities positions the service may treat certain positions in securities held directly or indirectly by a member and its indirect interest in similar securities held by the company as straddles for federal income tax purposes investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the straddle rules to their investment in the company limitation on deductibility of interest and short sale expenses for noncorporate taxpayers section d of the code limits the deduction for investment interest ie interest or short sale expenses for indebtedness properly allocable to property held for investment investment interest is not deductible in the current year to the extent that it exceeds the taxpayers net investment income consisting of net gain and ordinary income derived from investments in the current year less certain directly connected expenses other than interest or short sale expenses for this purpose qualified dividends and longterm capital gains are excluded from net investment income unless the taxpayer elects to pay tax on such amounts at ordinary income tax rates for purposes of this provision the companys activities will be treated as giving rise to investment income for a member and the investment interest limitation would apply to a noncorporate members share of the interest and short sale expenses attributable to the companys operation in such case a noncorporate member would be denied a deduction for all or part of that portion of its distributive share of the   b      companys ordinary losses attributable to interest and short sale expenses unless it had sufficient investment income from all sources including the company a member that could not deduct losses currently as a result of the application of section d would be entitled to carry forward such losses to future years subject to the same limitation the investment interest limitation would also apply to interest paid by a noncorporate member on money borrowed to finance its investment in the company potential investors are advised to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the application of the investment interest limitation in their particular tax situations deductibility of company investment expenditures and certain other expenditures investment expenses eg investment advisory fees of an individual trust or estate are deductible only to the extent they exceed  of adjusted gross income in addition the code further restricts the ability of an individual with an adjusted gross income in excess of a specified amount to deduct such investment expenses under such provision there is a limitation on the deductibility of investment expenses in excess of  of adjusted gross income to the extent such excess expenses along with certain other itemized deductions exceed the lesser of i  of the excess of the individuals adjusted gross income over the specified amount or ii  of the amount of certain itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the taxable year moreover such investment expenses are miscellaneous itemized deductions which are not deductible by a noncorporate taxpayer in calculating its alternative minimum tax liability it is unclear whether all or a portion of the companys operations will qualify as trading  rather than investment  activities the expenses for which would not be treated as investment expenses therefore pursuant to temporary regulations issued by the treasury department these limitations on deductibility may apply to a noncorporate members share of certain expenses of the company including the management fee the fee paid to an administrator and payments made on certain derivative instruments the consequences of these limitations will vary depending upon the particular tax situation of each taxpayer accordingly noncorporate members should consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of these limitations the company may elect to deduct organizational expenses for tax purposes over a fixed period of  months a member will not be allowed to deduct syndication expenses including placement fees paid by such member or the company any such amounts will be included in the members adjusted tax basis for its interest  the specified amount for taxable years beginning during  is  for married individuals filing jointly  for married individuals filing separately  for heads of households and  for other individuals  b      application of rules for income and losses from passive activities the code restricts the deductibility of losses from a passive activity against certain income which is not derived from a passive activity this restriction applies to individuals personal service corporations and certain closely held corporations pursuant to temporary regulations issued by the treasury department income or loss from the companys investment and trading activity generally will not constitute income or loss from a passive activity therefore passive losses from other sources generally could not be deducted against a members share of such income and gain from the company income or loss attributable to certain activities of the company including investments in partnerships engaged in certain trades or businesses may constitute passive activity income or loss application of basis and at risk limitations on deductions the amount of any loss of the company that a member is entitled to include in its income tax return is limited to its adjusted tax basis in its interest as of the end of the companys taxable year in which such loss occurred generally a members adjusted tax basis for its interest is equal to the amount paid for such interest increased by the sum of i its share of the companys liabilities as determined for federal income tax purposes and ii its distributive share of the companys realized income and gains and decreased but not below zero by the sum of i distributions including decreases in its share of company liabilities made by the company to such member and ii such members distributive share of the companys realized losses and expenses similarly a member that is subject to the at risk limitations generally noncorporate taxpayers and closely held corporations may not deduct losses of the company to the extent that they exceed the amount such member has at risk with respect to its interest at the end of the year the amount that a member has at risk will generally be the same as its adjusted basis as described above except that it will generally not include any amount attributable to liabilities of the company or any amount borrowed by the member on a nonrecourse basis losses denied under the basis or at risk limitations are suspended and may be carried forward in subsequent taxable years subject to these and other applicable limitations phantom income from company investments pursuant to various antideferral provisions of the code the subpart f and passive foreign investment company provisions investments if any by the company in certain foreign corporations may cause a member to i recognize taxable income prior to the companys receipt of distributable proceeds ii pay an interest charge on receipts that are deemed as having been deferred or iii recognize ordinary income that but for the antideferral provisions would have been treated as longterm or shortterm capital gain  b      foreign taxes it is possible that certain dividends and interest received by the company from sources within foreign countries will be subject to withholding taxes imposed by such countries in addition the company may also be subject to capital gains taxes in some of the foreign countries where it purchases and sells securities tax treaties between certain countries and the united states may reduce or eliminate such taxes it is impossible to predict in advance the rate of foreign tax the company will pay since the amount of the companys assets to be invested in various countries is not known the members will be informed by the company as to their proportionate share of the foreign taxes paid by the company which they will be required to include in their income the members generally will be entitled to claim either a credit subject to the limitations discussed below and provided that in the case of dividends the foreign stock is held for the requisite holding period or if they itemize their deductions a deduction subject to the limitations generally applicable to deductions for their share of such foreign taxes in computing their federal income taxes a member that is taxexempt will not ordinarily benefit from such credit or deduction generally a credit for foreign taxes is subject to the limitation that it may not exceed the members federal tax before the credit attributable to its total foreign source taxable income a members share of the companys dividends and interest from nonus securities generally will qualify as foreign source income generally the source of gain and loss realized upon the sale of personal property such as securities will be based on the residence of the seller in the case of a partnership the determining factor is the residence of the partner thus absent a tax treaty to the contrary the gains and losses from the sale of securities allocable to a member that is a us resident generally will be treated as derived from us sources even though the securities are sold in foreign countries for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation calculation investors entitled to the reduced tax rates on qualified dividends and longterm capital gains described above see tax treatment of company investments – in general must adjust their foreign tax credit limitation calculation to take into account the preferential tax rate on such income to the extent it is derived from foreign sources certain currency fluctuation gains including fluctuation gains from foreign currency denominated debt securities receivables and payables will also be treated as ordinary income derived from us sources the limitation on the foreign tax credit generally is applied separately to foreign source passive income such as dividends and interest in addition for foreign tax credit limitation purposes the amount of a members foreign source income is reduced by various deductions that are allocated andor apportioned to such foreign source income one such deduction is interest expense a portion of which will generally reduce the foreign source income of any member who owns directly or indirectly foreign assets for these purposes foreign assets owned by the company will be treated as owned by the investors in the company and indebtedness incurred by the company will be treated as incurred by investors in the company  b      because of these limitations members may be unable to claim a credit for the full amount of their proportionate share of the foreign taxes paid by the company in addition a foreign tax credit may not be available to offset the medicare tax on nii the foregoing is only a general description of the foreign tax credit under current law moreover since the availability of a credit or deduction depends on the particular circumstances of each member members are advised to consult their own tax advisors unrelated business taxable income generally an exempt organization is exempt from federal income tax on its passive investment income such as dividends interest and capital gains whether realized by the organization directly or indirectly through a partnership in which it is a partner this type of income is exempt even if it is realized from securities trading activity which constitutes a trade or business this general exemption from tax does not apply to the unrelated business taxable income ubti of an exempt organization generally except as noted above with respect to certain categories of exempt trading activity ubti includes income or gain derived either directly or through partnerships from a trade or business the conduct of which is substantially unrelated to the exercise or performance of the organizations exempt purpose or function ubti also includes unrelated debtfinanced income which generally consists of i income derived by an exempt organization directly or through a partnership from incomeproducing property with respect to which there is acquisition indebtedness at any time during the taxable year and ii gains derived by an exempt organization directly or through a partnership from the disposition of property with respect to which there is acquisition indebtedness at any time during the twelvemonth period ending with the date of such disposition with respect to its investments in partnerships engaged in a trade or business the companys income or loss from these investments may constitute ubti the company may incur acquisition indebtedness with respect to certain of its transactions such as the purchase of securities on margin based upon a published ruling issued by the service which generally holds that income and gain with respect to short sales of publicly traded stock does not constitute income from debt financed property for purposes of computing ubti the company will treat its short sales of securities as not involving acquisition indebtedness and therefore not resulting in ubti to the extent the company recognizes income ie dividends and interest from securities with respect to which there is acquisition indebtedness during a taxable year the percentage of such income which will be treated as ubti generally will be based on the percentage which the average acquisition indebtedness incurred with respect to such securities is of the average amount of the adjusted basis of such securities during the taxable year  with certain exceptions taxexempt organizations which are private foundations are subject to a  federal excise tax on their net investment income the rate of the excise tax for any taxable year may be reduced to  if the private foundation meets certain distribution requirements for the taxable year a private foundation will be required to make payments of estimated tax with respect to this excise tax moreover income realized from option writing and futures contract transactions generally would not constitute ubti  b       to the extent the company recognizes gain from securities with respect to which there is acquisition indebtedness at any time during the twelvemonth period ending with the date of their disposition the percentage of such gain which will be treated as ubti will be based on the percentage which the highest amount of such acquisition indebtedness is of the average amount of the adjusted basis of such securities during the taxable year in determining the unrelated debtfinanced income of the company an allocable portion of deductions directly connected with the companys debtfinanced property is taken into account thus for instance a percentage of losses from debtfinanced securities based on the debtbasis percentage calculation described above would offset gains treated as ubti since the calculation of the companys unrelated debtfinanced income is complex and will depend in large part on the amount of leverage used by the company from time to time it is impossible to predict what percentage of the companys income and gains will be treated as ubti for a member which is an exempt organization an exempt organizations share of the income or gains of the company which is treated as ubti may not be offset by losses of the exempt organization either from the company or otherwise unless such losses are treated as attributable to an unrelated trade or business eg losses from securities for which there is acquisition indebtedness to the extent that the company generates ubti the applicable federal tax rate for such a member generally would be either the corporate or trust tax rate depending upon the nature of the particular exempt organization an exempt organization may be required to support to the satisfaction of the service the method used to calculate its ubti the company will be required to report to a member which is an exempt organization information as to the portion of its income and gains from the company for each year which will be treated as ubti the calculation of such amount with respect to transactions entered into by the company is highly complex and there is no assurance that the companys calculation of ubti will be accepted by the service in general if ubti is allocated to an exempt organization such as a qualified retirement plan or a private foundation the portion of the companys income and gains which is not treated as ubti will continue to be exempt from tax as will the organizations income and gains from other investments which are not treated as ubti therefore the possibility of realizing ubti from its investment in the company generally should not affect the taxexempt status of such an exempt organization in addition a charitable remainder trust will be subject to a  excise tax on any ubti under section c of the code a titleholding company will not be exempt from tax if it has certain types of ubti moreover the charitable contribution deduction for a trust under section c of the code may be limited for any year in which the trust has ubti a prospective investor should consult its tax advisor with respect to the tax consequences of receiving ubti from the company see erisa considerations  the calculation of a particular exempt organizations ubti would also be affected if it incurs indebtedness to finance its investment in the company an exempt organization is required to make estimated tax payments with respect to its ubti certain exempt organizations which realize ubti in a taxable year will not constitute qualified organizations for purposes of section cbvii of the code pursuant to which in limited circumstances income from certain real estate partnerships in which such organizations invest might be treated as exempt from ubti a prospective taxexempt member should consult its tax adviser in this regard  b      certain issues pertaining to specific exempt organizations private foundations private foundations and their managers are subject to excise taxes if they invest any amount in such a manner as to jeopardize the carrying out of any of the foundations exempt purposes this rule requires a foundation manager in making an investment to exercise ordinary business care and prudence under the facts and circumstances prevailing at the time of making the investment in providing for the shortterm and longterm needs of the foundation to carry out its exempt purposes the factors which a foundation manager may take into account in assessing an investment include the expected rate of return both income and capital appreciation the risks of rising and falling price levels and the need for diversification within the foundations portfolio in order to avoid the imposition of an excise tax a private foundation may be required to distribute on an annual basis its distributable amount which includes among other things the private foundations minimum investment return defined as  of the excess of the fair market value of its nonfunctionally related assets assets not used or held for use in carrying out the foundations exempt purposes over certain indebtedness incurred by the foundation in connection with such assets it appears that a foundations investment in the company would most probably be classified as a nonfunctionally related asset a determination that an interest is a nonfunctionally related asset could conceivably cause cash flow problems for a prospective member which is a private foundation such an organization could be required to make distributions in an amount determined by reference to unrealized appreciation in the value of its interest of course this factor would create less of a problem to the extent that the value of the investment in the company is not significant in relation to the value of other assets held by a foundation in some instances an investment in the company by a private foundation may be prohibited by the excess business holdings provisions of the code for example if a private foundation either directly or together with a disqualified person acquires more than  of the capital interest or profits interest of the company the private foundation may be considered to have excess business holdings if this occurs such foundation may be required to divest itself of its interest in order to avoid the imposition of an excise tax however the excise tax will not apply if at least  of the gross income from the company is passive within the applicable provisions of the code and regulations there can be no assurance that the company will meet such  gross income test a substantial percentage of investments of certain private operating foundations may be restricted to assets directly devoted to their taxexempt purposes otherwise generally rules similar to those discussed above govern their operations  b      qualified retirement plans employee benefit plans subject to the provisions of erisa individual retirement accounts and keogh plans should consult their counsel as to the implications of such an investment under erisa and the code see erisa considerations endowment funds investment managers of endowment funds should consider whether the acquisition of an interest is legally permissible this is not a matter of federal law but is determined under state statutes it should be noted however that under the uniform management of institutional funds act which has been adopted in various forms by a large number of states participation in investment partnerships or similar organizations in which funds are commingled and investment determinations are made by persons other than the governing board of the endowment fund is allowed excise tax on certain reportable transactions a taxexempt entity including a state or local government or its political subdivision may be subject to an excise tax equal to the greater of i one hundred percent  of the net income or ii seventy five percent  of the proceeds attributable to certain reportable transactions including listed transactions in which it participates under regulations these rules should not apply to a taxexempt investors interest if such investors taxexempt status does not facilitate the companys participation if any in such transactions unless otherwise provided in future guidance taxexempt investors should discuss with their own advisors the applicability of these rules to their investment in the company see tax shelter reporting requirements below certain reporting obligations certain us persons potential filers that own directly or indirectly more than  of the capital or profits of the company may be required to file form td f  an fbar with respect to the companys investments in foreign financial accounts failure to file a required fbar may result in civil and criminal penalties potential filers should consult with their own advisors as to whether they are obligated to file an fbar with respect to an investment in the company  b      tax shelter reporting requirements the regulations require the company to complete and file form  reportable transaction disclosure statement with its tax return for any taxable year in which the company participates in a reportable transaction additionally each member treated as participating in a reportable transaction of the company is generally required to file form  with its tax return or in certain cases within  days of the returns due date if the service designates a transaction as a reportable transaction after the filing of a taxpayers tax return for the year in which the company or a member participated in the transaction the company andor such member may have to file form  with respect to that transaction within  days after the service makes the designation the company and any such member respectively must also submit a copy of the completed form with the services office of tax shelter analysis the company intends to notify the members that it believes based on information available to the company are required to report a transaction of the company and intends to provide such members with any available information needed to complete and submit form  with respect to the companys transactions in certain situations there may also be a requirement that a list be maintained of persons participating in such reportable transactions which could be made available to the service at its request a members recognition of a loss upon its disposition of an interest in the company could also constitute a reportable transaction for such member requiring such member to file form  a significant penalty is imposed on taxpayers who participate in a reportable transaction and fail to make the required disclosure the maximum penalty is  for natural persons and  for other persons increased to  and  respectively if the reportable transaction is a listed transaction investors should consult with their own advisors concerning the application of these reporting obligations to their specific situations state and local taxation in addition to the federal income tax consequences described above prospective investors should consider potential state and local tax consequences of an investment in the company state and local tax laws differ in the treatment of limited liability companies such as the company a few jurisdictions may impose entity level taxes on a limited liability company if it is found to have sufficient contact with that jurisdiction such taxes are frequently based on the income and capital of the entity that is allocated to the jurisdiction although there can be no assurance the company intends to conduct its activities so that it will not be subject to entity level taxation by any state or local jurisdiction  b      state and local laws often differ from federal income tax laws with respect to the treatment of specific items of income gain loss deduction and credit a members distributive share of the taxable income or loss of the company generally will be required to be included in determining its reportable income for state and local tax purposes in the jurisdiction in which it is a resident  a partnership in which the company acquires an interest may conduct business in a jurisdiction which will subject to tax a members share of the partnerships income from that business and may cause members to file tax returns in those jurisdictions prospective investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to the availability of a credit for such tax in the jurisdiction in which that member is a resident the tax laws of various states and localities limit or eliminate the deductibility of itemized deductions for certain taxpayers these limitations may apply to a members share of some or all of the companys expenses including interest expense to the extent that the expenses are not considered to be trade or business expenses in the applicable jurisdiction prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the impact of these provisions on the deductibility of certain itemized deductions including interest expense on their tax liabilities in the jurisdictions in which they are resident one or more states may impose reporting requirements on the company andor its members in a manner similar to that described above in tax shelter reporting requirements investors should

now or organized in the future for which the adviser or any entity controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser acts as investment adviser and which provides liquidity to investors by means of issuer tender offers made in compliance with rule e under the securities exchange act of  as amended the  act or in compliance with rule a under the  act any such other investment company relying on the requested order will do so in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of this application applicants represent that each person presently intending to rely on the order requested in this application is listed as an applicant the fund is a delaware limited liability company that is registered under the  act as a closedend management investment company the fund is classified as a nondiversified investment company under the  act the funds investment objective is capital appreciation the fund employs a valueoriented investment strategy that principally focuses on both long and short positions in equity securities of european issuers which the fund defines as companies that derive a majority of their revenue or profits from european businesses investments or sales that have a majority of their operations or assets located in europe or that are listed on a securities exchange in europe the funds investments may also include investments in the securities of companies that are located in or conduct business in emerging or less developed countries    as used in this application interests includes any other equivalent designation of a proportionate ownership interest in any other registered closedend management investment company relying on the requested order    the term investment adviser is used as defined in section a of the  act   page  of  pages including exhibits   interests in the fund are offered on a continuous basis at net asset value plus any applicable sales load as described in the funds confidential private placement memorandum the confidential memorandum the fund currently issues a single class of interests the initial class interests are sold only to persons who are both a accredited investors as defined in regulation d under the securities act of  as amended the securities act and b qualified clients as defined in rule  under the investment advisers act of  as amended the advisers act the fund reserves the right to register interests under the securities act and to conduct a public offering of interests in the future interests are not offered or traded in a secondary market and are not listed on any securities exchange or quoted on any quotation medium because persons owning interests in the fund members do not have the right to require the fund to redeem their interests the fund from time to time offers to repurchase interests from members pursuant to written tenders by members in accordance with rule e under the  act in order to provide a limited degree of liquidity to members repurchases of interests in the fund are made at such times in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the funds board of managers the board and each member thereof a manager in its sole discretion in determining whether the fund should offer to repurchase interests the board considers a variety of operational business and economic factors the adviser expects to ordinarily recommend that the board authorize the fund to offer to repurchase interests from members four times each year effective at the end of march june september and december as with openend management investment companies that issue multiple classes of shares pursuant to rule f under the  act the different classes of interests in the fund would represent investments in the same portfolio of securities but would be subject to different expenses such as assetbased service andor distribution fees thus the net income attributable to and any dividends payable on each class of interests will differ from the other classes from time to time as a result the net asset value of interests of the classes may differ over time under the proposal each new class of interests in the fund each a new class would be offered at net asset value and may but would not necessarily be subject to a frontend sales load and an assetbased service fee andor distribution fee initial class interests would continue to be offered at net asset value with a frontend sales load and with an assetbased service andor distribution fees that would be imposed and disclosed in the funds confidential memorandum as

registered under the  act as a closedend management investment company the fund is classified as a nondiversified investment company under the  act the fund was organized under the laws of the state of delaware on november   the adviser is a limited liability partnership incorporated under the laws of england and wales and is registered with the commission as an investment adviser under the advisers act the adviser serves as the investment adviser to the fund the adviser and the fund may contract with third parties to act as placement agents for the fund in connection with the offering of interests each a placement agent b fund structure and characteristics as noted above interests are offered on a continuous basis at their net asset value plus any applicable sales load interests may be purchased on the first business day of any month or at such other times as the board may determine interests are sold only to persons who are both a accredited investors as defined in regulation d under the securities act and b qualified clients as defined in rule  under the advisers act the fund as a closedend investment company does not issue redeemable interests as does an openend management investment company interests in the fund are not listed on any securities exchange and do not trade on an overthecounter system such as nasdaq furthermore it is not expected that any secondary market will ever develop for interests thus in order to provide a limited degree of liquidity to members the fund from time to time makes offers to repurchase interests from members at the then current net asset value of interests pursuant to rule e under the  act such offers are made at such times in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the board in its sole discretion the fund currently offers a single class of interests that is subject to a sales load of up to  of the amount transmitted in connection with an investors subscription and does not pay any distribution fees or service fees   page  of  pages including exhibits   c proposed class structure and characteristics the fund proposes to offer multiple classes of interests such as the initial class interests and new class interests described below or any other classes additional classes may permit an investor to choose the method of purchasing interests that the investor deems most beneficial based on factors applicable to the investor such as the amount of the purchase or the length of time the investor expects to hold the interests they may also permit the fund to offer classes that accommodate the varying needs of different financial intermediaries in the future the board could adopt another structure with respect to sales charges and service andor distribution fees if the order requested in this application is granted it is anticipated that initial class interests would be  offered at net asset value  subject to imposition of a sales load of up to   subject to a minimum initial investment requirement of  and minimum subsequent investment requirement of   subject to an annual assetbased service fee andor distribution fee pursuant to rule b under the  act subject to the approval of any distribution fee by the board and by members holding initial class interests and  subject to an early repurchase fee in each case as set forth in the funds confidential memorandum as amended or supplemented from time to time if the order requested in this application is granted new class interests are expected to be  offered at net asset value and are not expected to but may be subject to a frontend sales load  subject to a minimum initial investment requirement of  and minimum subsequent investment requirement of   would not be subject to an assetbased service andor distribution fee pursuant to rule b under the  act and  subject to an early repurchase fee in each case as set forth in the funds confidential memorandum as amended or supplemented from time to time these charges would differ in some respect from those applicable to the initial class interests however the early repurchase fee will apply equally to all classes of interests of the fund actual fees approved and adopted may vary but no class of interests in the fund would have annual assetbased service andor distribution fees in excess of the limits established by nasd conduct rule  it is anticipated that subject to approval by the board and members the fund will adopt a distribution and service plan for the initial class in voluntary compliance with the provisions of rules b and d under the  act as if those rules applied to closedend management investment companies a distribution and service plan the distribution and service plan will be approved by the board including a majority of the managers who are not interested persons of the fund as defined by section a of the  act and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the distribution and service plan or in any agreements related to the distribution and service plan as provided by rule b the distribution and service plan will not be implemented prior to its approval by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the fund as required by rule bb for an openend management investment company that has already commenced an offering of the companys securities pursuant to its distribution and service plan the fund will pay to placement agents an ongoing distribution andor service fee the distribution and service fee at an annualized rate of up to  of the average net assets attributable to the initial class this distribution and service fee will provide for compensation at the annual rates of up to  for the sale and marketing of interests and up to  for services provided to members andor the maintenance of member accounts eg responding to member inquiries and providing information to members on their investments in the fund with the aggregate not to exceed

the  act as if it were an openend management investment company    a repurchase fee equal to  of the value of the interests repurchased which is retained by the fund the early repurchase fee will apply with respect to any repurchases of interests if the date as of which the interests are to be valued for purposes of repurchase is less than one year following the date of a members initial investment in the fund the early repurchase fee charged by the fund is not the same as a contingent deferred sales charge cdsc assessed by an openend fund pursuant to rule c under the  act as cdscs are distributionrelated charges payable to a distributor whereas the early repurchase fee is payable to the fund to compensate longterm shareholders for the expenses related to shorterterm investors in light of the funds generally longerterm investment horizons and investment operations although the fund does not currently intend to impose cdscs it would only do so pursuant to rule c under the  act   page  of  pages including exhibits   all distribution and service fees with respect to any class would be paid pursuant to a distribution and service plan adopted by the fund with respect to that class under any distribution and service plan the fund either directly or through a placement agent would compensate brokers dealers or other financial intermediaries for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of interests and for services provided to members andor the maintenance of member accounts applicants represent that these assetbased distribution and service fees will comply with the provisions of nasd conduct rule  the fund does not intend to offer any exchange privilege or conversion feature but any such privilege or feature offered in the future will comply with rule a rule a and rule f as if the fund were an openend investment company although the fund does not intend to do so the fund may waive the early repurchase fee for certain shareholders or transactions as established from time to time with respect to any waiver of scheduled variation in or elimination of the early repurchase fee the fund will comply with rule d under the  act as if the early repurchase fee were a cdsc and as if the fund were an openend investment company and the funds waiver of scheduled variation in or elimination of the early repurchase fee will apply uniformly to all members regardless of class all expenses incurred by the fund will be allocated among its various classes of interests based on the respective net assets of the fund attributable to each such class except that the net asset value and expenses of each class will reflect the fees associated with the distribution and service plan of that class if any member services fees attributable to a particular class including transfer agency fees if any and any other incremental expenses of that class in addition to assetbased distribution andor service fees each class of interests of the fund may by action of the board also pay a different amount of the following expenses  administrative andor accounting or similar fees each as described in the funds confidential memorandum as amended or

sales load structure and  any conversion features as permitted under the  act the fund will comply with the provisions of rule f under the  act as if it were an openend management investment company the funds offers to repurchase interests will be made to all of its classes of interests at the same time and on the same terms except for differences in the prices at which interests are repurchased resulting from differences in fees under a distribution and service plan andor service plan or in class expenses because of the different distribution fees member services fees and any other class expenses that may be attributable to the different classes the net income attributable to and any dividends payable on each class of interests may differ from each other and the net asset value per interest of the classes may differ over time expenses of the fund allocated to a particular class of the funds interests will be borne on a pro rata basis by each outstanding interest of that class    applicants note however that the fund is not and will not be a daily dividend fund as defined in rule f   page  of  pages including exhibits   iii exemptions requested a the multiple class system applicants request exemptive relief to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of multiple classes of interests in the fund may be deemed  to result in the issuance of a senior security within the meaning of section g of the  act and thus be prohibited by section c and  to violate the equal voting provisions of section i of the  act b assetbased service andor distribution fees applicants request an order pursuant to section d of the  act and rule d thereunder to the extent necessary for the fund to pay assetbased service andor distribution fees iv commission authority pursuant to section c of the  act the commission may by order on application conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision or provisions of the  act or from any rule or regulation under the  act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act pursuant to section d of the  act and rule d thereunder the commission may issue an order permitting an affiliated person of or a principal underwriter for a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person or principal underwriter acting as principal to participate in or effect a transaction in connection with a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit sharing plan in which the investment company or a company controlled by such registered company participates in reviewing applications submitted under section d and rule d the commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in such joint enterprise joint arrangement or profit sharing plan is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the  act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants v discussion a background in its  study entitled protecting investors a half century of investment company regulation protecting investors the commissions division of investment management recognized that the  act imposes a rigid classification system that dictates many important regulatory consequences for example the characterization of a management company as openend or closedend has historically been crucial to the determination of the degree of liquidity the funds shareholders will have historically except as noted below there was no middle ground between the two extremes of the openend and the closedend forms openend funds offered daily liquidity to their members while closedend funds have been subject to requirements that restrict the liquidity they are permitted to offer their investors under this system of regulation neither form may provide the best structure for offering certain types of investments to investors in protecting investors the staff of the commission determined that given the changes in the securities market since  it was appropriate to reexamine the classification system and its regulatory requirements and that it would be appropriate to provide the opportunity for investment companies to chart new territory between the two extremes of the openend and the closedend forms consistent with investor protection    securities and exchange commission staff report protecting investors may  at    page  of  pages including exhibits   one exception to the openendclosedend dichotomy cited in protecting investors has been the socalled prime rate fund many of these funds first introduced in  invest in adjustable rate senior loans and provide members liquidity through quarterly repurchases closedend tender offer funds shortly after protecting investors was published the commission proposed rule c under the  act which provided flexibility to increase liquidity available to investors through periodic tender offers under simplified procedures rule c was adopted in april  prime rate funds were cited in both protecting investors and in the rule c proposing release as the prototype for the closedend interval fund concept developments since the initial closedend interval funds make further innovation appropriate many funds either cannot or choose not to rely on rule c therefore there exist a large number of closedend tender offer funds which fall between openend and closedend designations in regard to their operations but which are not interval funds moreover a number of precedents exist for the implementation of a multipleclass system and the imposition of assetbased service andor distribution fees substantially similar to that for which applicants seek relief see eg

than constant liquidity the commission neither adopted nor withdrew proposed rule e    protecting investors supra note  at  c proposing release at    page  of  pages including exhibits   b multiple classes of interests – exemptions from sections c and i under the  act applicants request exemptive relief to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of multiple classes of interests in the fund may be deemed  to result in the issuance of a senior security within the meaning of section g of the  act and thus be prohibited by section c and  to violate the equal voting provisions of section i of the  act a registered closedend investment company may have only one class of stock that is a senior security in particular section c of the  act provides in relevant part that it shall be unlawful for any registered closedend investment company    to issue or sell any senior security which is a stock if immediately thereafter such company will have outstanding more than one class of senior security which is a stock except that  any such class of    stock may be issued in one or more series provided that no such series shall have a preference or priority over any other series upon the distribution of the assets of such registered closedend company or in respect of the payment of interest or dividends     section i of the  act provides in relevant part that except as provided in subsection a of this section or as otherwise required by law every share of stock hereafter issued by a registered management company    shall be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock provided that this subsection shall not apply    to shares issued in accordance with any rules regulations or orders which the commission may make permitting such issue the multiple class system proposed herein the multiple class system may be deemed to result in interests of a class having priority over another class as to    payment of    dividends and in having unequal voting rights because under the multiple class system  members of different classes may pay different distribution fees different member services fees and any other expenses as described above in section iic that should be properly allocated to a particular class and  each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of interests in the fund as proposed in this application may thus be prohibited by section c and section i of the  act applicants seek to implement the multiple class system to provide the flexibility to create new classes of interests without having to create new funds or a masterfeeder structure applicants believe that current and future members will benefit if new classes of interests with different pricing structures are created providing alternative investment options under the multiple class system the fund would be able to offer investors and financial intermediaries alternatives for investing in the fund that are best suited to their needs and requirements based on relevant factors applicable to them such as the amount of the purchase the length of time the investor expects to hold the interests the nature of the investors account and other relevant factors the proposed system would permit the fund to facilitate the distribution of interests and provide a broader choice of investment options by contrast if the multiple class system is not permitted it would be necessary to organize new separate funds rather than new classes of interests the creation of the new separate funds including funds to create a masterfeeder structure would involve increased costs and administrative burdens borne by members as compared to the creation of additional classes of interests in the fund which is a less costly alternative   page  of  pages including exhibits   under the multiple class system holders of each class of interests will be relieved of a portion of the fixed costs normally associated with investing in investment companies because these costs will be spread over a greater asset base than would be the case if assets were held by separate funds or portfolios as the assets of the fund grow it is expected that investors will derive benefits from economies of scale that might not be available absent the multiple class system the commission has long recognized that multiple class arrangements can be structured so that the concerns underlying the  acts senior security provisions are satisfied after having granted numerous exemptive orders multiple class exemptive orders to openend management investment companies permitting those funds to issue two or more classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio in  the commission adopted rule f under the  act which now permits openend funds to create multiple classes without seeking individual exemptive orders as long as certain conditions are met applicants believe that the proposed multiple class system does not raise the concerns underlying section  of the  act to any greater degree than openend investment companies multiple class structures the multiple class system does not relate to borrowings and will not adversely affect the funds assets in addition the proposed system will not increase the speculative character of interests applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses relating to distribution and voting rights is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of members applicants believe that the rationale for and the conditions contained in rule f are as applicable to a closedend investment company seeking to offer multiple classes of shares with varying distribution and service arrangements in a single portfolio as they are to openend investment companies the fund will comply with the provisions of rule f as if it were an openend investment company including among others the rules provisions relating to differences in expenses special allocations of other expenses voting rights conversions and disclosure in fact the fund will in many ways resemble an openend investment company in its manner of operation and in the distribution of interests except for differences related to repurchase offers in particular the fund proposes to offer interests continuously at net asset value it is anticipated that differences among classes will as detailed above relate largely to differences in placementdistribution and service fees and arrangements applicants note that openend and closedend funds are subject to different technical provisions governing the issuance of senior securities however those technical differences do not appear relevant here while closedend funds may not issue multiple classes of shares without exemptive relief the commission has granted specific exemptive relief to numerous similarlysituated closedend funds provisions regulating the issuance by closedend funds of debt or preferred stock should have no bearing on an application by a closedend fund for an exemptive order permitting the issuance of multiple classes of interests in the manner applicants propose therefore applicants propose to base the conditions under which the fund would issue multiple classes of interests on those contained in rule f    see investment company act rel no  feb   as adopted rule f under the  act creates an exemption for openend funds that issue multiple classes of shares with varying arrangements for the distribution of securities and the provision of services to shareholders in connection with the adoption of rule f the commission also amended rule b under the  act to clarify that each class of shares must have separate b plan provisions moreover any action on the b plan ie manager or shareholder approval must take place separately for each class the commission has adopted amendments to rule f that expand and clarify the methods by which a multiple class fund may allocate income gains and losses and expenses and that clarify the shareholder voting provisions of the rule    see eg

relating to the assetbased distribution and service fees applicable to classes of interests in the fund in the manner required by rule f is equitable and will not discriminate against any group of members the fund is also aware of the need for full disclosure in its confidential memorandum of the proposed multiple class system and of the differences among the various classes and the different expenses of each class of interests offered applicants represent that the funds distribution andor service fees will comply with the provisions of nasd conduct rule  applicants also represent that the fund will disclose in its confidential memorandum the fees expenses and other characteristics of each class of interests offered for sale as is required for openend multiple class funds under form na as if it were an openend management investment company the fund will disclose fund expenses borne by members during the reporting period in shareholder reports and will describe in its confidential memorandum any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or elimination of sales loads the fund will include any such disclosures in its shareholder reports and confidential memorandum to the extent required as if the fund were an openend fund the fund will also comply with any requirements that may be adopted by the commission or finra regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of openend investment company shares and regarding disclosure of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements as if those requirements applied to the fund and placement agents upon adoption of any such proposed rules or required disclosures the fund will contractually require that placement agents for interests comply with such requirements in connection with the distribution of interests in the fund the requested relief is substantially similar to prior exemptions granted by the commission to princeton

thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the fund to impose assetbased service andor distribution fees in a manner similar to rule b fees for an openend investment company section b of the  act and rule b thereunder do not apply to closed end investment companies accordingly no provisions of the  act or the rules thereunder explicitly limit the ability of a closedend fund to impose an assetbased service andor distribution fee section d of the  act prohibits an affiliated person of or a principal underwriter for a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such a person or principal underwriter acting as principal from participating in or effecting any transaction in which such registered company or a company controlled by such registered company is a joint or a joint and several participant in contravention of commission regulations rule d provides that no joint transaction covered by the rule may be consummated unless the commission issues an order upon application permitting the transaction in reviewing applications pursuant to section d and rule d the commission considers whether an investment companys participation in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the  act and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants section d of the  act is intended to prevent or limit abuses arising from conflicts of interest however section d itself does not prohibit any specific activities but instead authorizes the commission to adopt rules to limit or prevent an investment company from being a joint participant on a different or less advantageous basis than other participants under rule d it is unlawful for an affiliated person of or a principal underwriter for a registered investment company acting as principal to participate in or effect any transaction in connection with a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which the investment company is a participant without prior commission approval the protections provided for in section d essentially allow the commission to set standards for all transactions concerning an investment company and an affiliate which could be construed as selfdealing or overreaching by the affiliate to the detriment of the investment company the fund will comply with the protections for openend investment companies developed and approved by the commission in rule b in connection with its distribution and service plans if any with respect to each class as if the fund were an openend investment company therefore the fund will operate under substantially the same conditions as would be the case if it were an openend investment company imposing assetbased service andor distribution fees in accordance with rule b applicants note that at the same time the commission adopted rule b it also adopted rule d to provide an exemption from section d and rule d to the extent necessary for arrangements between openend funds and their affiliated persons or principal underwriters or affiliated persons of such persons or principal underwriters whereby distributionrelated payments are made by the openend fund if such agreements are entered into in compliance with rule b in its adopting release the commission stated    applicants do not concede that section d applies to the multiple class system or to the assetbased service andor distribution fees discussed herein but request this order to eliminate any uncertainty    see bearing of distribution expenses by mutual funds investment company act rel no  october     page  of  pages including exhibits   the commission wishes to emphasize that it has no intention of categorizing certain transactions as raising the applicability of section d and rule d of the  act the commissions only comment is that to the extent that arrangements in which a fund pays for its distribution costs could involve the fund in a joint enterprise with an affiliated person and if such arrangements were entered into in compliance with rule b the commission sees no need for prior commission review and approval of the arrangements applicants believe that any section d concerns the commission might have in connection with the funds financing of expenses relating to the distribution of its interests should be resolved by the funds undertakings to comply with the provisions of rule b and rule d as if those rules applied to closedend investment companies accordingly applicants undertake to comply and undertake that the funds assetbased service andor distribution fees if any will comply with the provisions of rule b and rule d as if those rules applied to closedend investment companies rule c under the  act permits openend investment companies to impose cdscs subject to certain conditions although the fund does not presently anticipate imposing cdscs applicants would only do so in compliance with rule c as if that rule applied to closedend investment companies the fund also would make all required disclosures in accordance with the requirements of form na concerning cdscs applicants further state that in the event the fund imposes a cdsc the fund will apply the cdsc and any waivers or scheduled variations of the cdsc uniformly to all members of a given class and consistently with the requirements of rule d under the  act finally to the extent the fund determines to waive impose scheduled variations of or eliminate the early repurchase fee it will do so consistently with the requirements of rule d under the  act and the funds waiver of scheduled variation in or elimination of the early repurchase fee will apply uniformly to all members of the fund vi
