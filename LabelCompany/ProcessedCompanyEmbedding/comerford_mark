you dave good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today hopefully you’ve all seen the press release and had a chance to review it we’ll follow our standard agenda in today’s call i’ll open with comments about the business and our end markets and then dan will give you greater detail on the financial results rather than give you a lot of macro information on today’s call i thought i’d focus on some very haynes specific situations i’ll still mix in some of the macros on the commentary but i think for the most part you all see what’s happening on the broader scale in our industry so i thought i’d give you more of how things are impacting haynes and what we’re doing as we go through today’s call second quarter started off with a good revenue month in january last time we spoke to you but as we got deeper into the numbers the profitability just wasn’t there the rest of the quarter as you can imagine was really a battle and an attempt to get haynes back to breakeven and we fell short as you’ll see in the q and press release pricing in the quarter was impacted by mix and a lower level of specialty projects but just to highlight for you how things went during the quarter and i won’t give you this level of detail too often our average pricing in january inclusive of our tolling operations was just over  a pound and that compares with the quarter’s average of over  per pound i hope that gives you an indication of just how poor our mix was in january and dan will give you more color on this as he gets into the financial commentary we mentioned in the q that we made some pricing adjustments during the quarter based on the improving backlog we’ve been seeing over the last quarter and throughout this quarter as well which we believe is going to help us in restoring our profitability all areas saw higher shipping volumes sequentially and all areas saw higher sequential revenues with the exception of our chemical processing market it’s the same story in the backlog it was all pretty much good news in the backlog in the quarter with again with all areas showing an improving overall backlog with the exception of the cpi business but even within the cpi we saw some of the higher volume alloys and those higher volume applications start to come back to life after gosh after probably about  years of being dormant but that was offset during the quarter by the depletion of some of our higher value special project work again i think a story we’ve been reiterating to you for probably at least the last quarter or two on the special project front right now we’re starting to see some higher quote activity again which is great news i’ll get into more detail on backlogs projects things like that as we discuss the individual markets i think with the positive macros we’re seeing like the continued strength in the ps – pmi or the ism index here in the us as well as in europe along with improving reports we’ve seen of some of our peers in the industry i think they support for the concept of a stronger operating environment as we move deeper into  moving to the numbers for the quarter net revenue was  million up  from the  million last year volume was  million pounds in the quarter an increase of  from last year’s similar level pricing inclusive of our other revenue which is primarily our tolling business was  per pound down about  from last year’s  per pound the net loss was  million as compared to last year’s net loss  million looking at the end markets net revenue in the aerospace market for the quarter was  million representing  of our total revenue sales were down about  from last year’s  million volume in this market increased  to  million pounds compared to last year but pricing was slightly off about  primarily due to transactional business competition and the lower value of the mix of products that we had going through sequentially revenue was up  and the backlog on top of this increased another  and i think it’s worth noting that the second quarter volumes were higher than at any time in all of fiscal  and that  million pounds we shipped is roughly equivalent to our record level run rate we saw in fiscal ‘ oddly i think if you asked me during the quarter if i felt we were having a strong aero quarter i probably would have said no and it was mainly because the mix of products we were shipping in the quarter appeared to me when i look at the shipping backlogs to be well below our normal mix again that’s strictly kind of a qualitative view i’d give you as opposed to a quantitative look the bookings that came in were often for future deliveries as opposed to inquarter shipments that gives you an idea of backlog increasing but when we talk about transactional volumes being pretty low it means essentially that we’re getting some orders that are for outmonths as opposed to inside the month that we’re currently operating and again that’s evidence of the increasing backlog i think the price levels we saw in the quarter were supportive of the subjective qualitative view that wasn’t – it was a great volume quarter don’t get me wrong great volume quarter in aerospace but the mix was relatively poor i’m thrilled with the work our people did in getting the  million pounds out this quarter running at a record output level is always a good thing but i’m looking forward to a better mix as we move deeper into  also on the good side i know we’re more capable now than ever of handling the increased volumes once this market moves to the next level of production i think everyone knows the macro story in commercial aerospace backlogs are extremely strong the engine supply chain is transitioning to the nextgeneration engines i think primarily we talk about the leap and the pratt  whitney  as well as the gex there have been some hiccups in the supply chain but we feel we’re ready with the capabilities and material well positioned to meet the increased demand we also you know continue to successfully develop a lot of new applications on nextgeneration engines with our proprietary alloys and i’ve spoken to you previously about haynes  and haynes  nickelbased alloys in our chemical processing market net revenue for the quarter was  million up  from last year’s the  million volume shipped was  pounds  from last year’s  pounds average selling prices of  per pound in the quarter was also up over last year’s  per pound a  primarily due to the highervalue product mix with special project work sequentially revenue fell about  in spite of the volume being up  again indicative of the mix shifts we’re seeing from quartertoquarter as special projects come and go in the second quarter of ‘ we shipped our final shipments of some key project work and as a result of that and the higher shipping level our backlog in cpi dropped during the quarter by almost  we’re starting to see some quotations and activity for highervolume materials again as i mentioned earlier many of which – these have been dormant since the crash in the market a couple of years ago we’re also seeing some better activity on the project side neither is resulting yet in a stronger order book but i think we’re in the early stages of this market starting to recover if you recall when this market started to head down it was about  or  quarters after many of our peers started feeling the collapse in the oil and gas business as the rig count is increasing in oil and gas i think we’re starting to see more positive signs in the base business of the chemical processing industry we didn’t expect the magnitude of the direct impact that we had when things went down but clearly we felt the pain of the industry in this market in my opinion in spite of our higher shipping levels in the second quarter of ‘ this market is still off about  to  what i would call normal operating volumes again it’s too early to tell where we are in the recovery but we’re seeing some indications of recovery at our account base by the way a large part of our business in china is targeted at the cpi market and april was the best booking month we’ve had from our chinese operations in about  years a lot of it is longer term ordering not transactional and not all of it is – by the way not all of that in china is cpi but our chinese operations had a very strong booking month which was great to see and by the way they’re also working on some project opportunities for applications that we haven’t seen in probably plus years so we’re hopefully going to be able to convert some of that project work into orders soon as well moving to the industrial gas turbine market our sales in the quarter totaled  million down  from last year’s  million but up sequentially  from last quarter’s  million volume shipped into this market was  million pounds up almost  from a year ago average selling prices were  per pound down about  from last year’s  per pound igt comprised  of our revenue in the quarter and along with the sequential increase in sales the backlog increased over  during the quarter as we discussed last time we’re about  years into the downturn in this market and whereas we’ve been seeing application wins for materials like haynes  along with better activity on the large and mediumframe engines the market for smaller engines is still very slow most of the activity that we’re seeing in igt right now is mro business it’s very lumpy very unpredictable order patterns we’re doing work with new materials and new applications both on the oem and mro side but right now the oem side is still very quiet we’re very close to key players in this market we’ve done an excellent job in penetrating the supply chains with our proprietary materials and parts manufacturing capabilities are also very well accepted in this market we believe we’re well positioned for the up cycle sequentially we responded well to the increase in volume and we managed to book a strong backlog as well but we still aren’t seeing a consistent rebound in this market not yet it’s still very spotty finally our other markets and other revenue accounted for  million during the quarter about  of our total revenue and down about  from last year’s  million but up sequentially a little over  from last quarter’s  million backlog increased as well up about  in the quarter some oil and gas applications are starting to flow through and we finally saw some new releases for some consumer electronics applications we won a year maybe  years ago core markets like flue gas desulfurization industrial heat treating brazing and renewables are still slow quote activity is actually pretty good in some of those areas but in addition our tolling business picked up dramatically during the quarter as we had our secondbest tolling quarter in the company’s history and by the way we look at our tolling business as one of the lead indicators in the industry when we see people we toll for getting busy it’s usually a good sign for all of us associated with the latercycle industries that are supported by nickel and cobaltbased alloys anyway hopefully that’ll be the case here as well on our operating side we’re just about finished with our major capital projects at our kokomo operations we’re up and running on the refurbished coldrolling mill and the equipment is in place with some programming done on the new modified annealing line this line is going to give us the surge capacity we’ll need as business starts to return it also gives us better efficiency and productivity in feeding our downstream operations on the it project we’re in the home stretch getting our wire operations online and we’re doing some additional programming and refining as well in that area i’d expect to be closing these projects out by the end of the fiscal year so that we’re fully operational for fiscal ‘ we’re also making progress on centralizing our distribution efforts into our laporte operations we’re starting to qualify equipment and relocate some equipment from other locations into laporte and we expect this will take place over the next i’ll say  months or so as we phase down operations in lebanon and relocate some of those operations and personnel to other haynes facilities with that let me turn it over to dan for more details on our financials dan maudlin thank you mark the slow start to this quarter was more of a headwind than we anticipated not from a volume perspective but more from a product mix perspective which impacted our average selling price per pound and our gross margins to further highlight this impact that mark was referencing the average selling price per pound including conversion revenue in the month of january was a low  per pound as compared to the quarterly average of  per pound similarly gross margin as a percentage of revenue in january was a low  as compared to the full quarter gross margin percentage of  the better product mix in february and march generated gross margins over  in each of those  months our average selling price per pound in the second quarter of fiscal year  was lower than each quarter of fiscal  and sequentially declined from the first to the second quarter of fiscal  sequentially we had lower levels of specialty application projects that contributed to the lower average selling price per pound and to the gross margin compression conversely shipping volumes in the second quarter of fiscal  were favorable with overall pounds shipped being higher than the best quarter of fiscal  and a solid sequential  increase from the first to the second quarter of fiscal  which includes increases in each of our market categories these better volumes drove better absorption of fixed costs helping to offset the unfavorable product mix and fewer specialty application projects previously noted gross margin as a percentage of sales was  in the second quarter of fiscal  sga costs combined with research and technical costs were  million in the second quarter of  which is slightly higher than the  million for the first quarter of fiscal ‘ and it was  million higher than the  million in the second quarter of last year the increase from last year was driven by a few factors such as a prior year expense reversal of performancebased restricted stock expense which did not occur this year that was approximately  unfavorable foreign currency impact was  with the remaining  being items such as planned higher spending to develop better information reporting for our operations spending related to selling and marketing activities and higher pension and postretirement medical expense to elaborate on the latter pension and retiree health care expense which impacts more cost of sales but some in sga increased to  million this quarter compared to last year due to the reduction in discount rates at our valuation at  this is a full year expected increase in expense of  million from  fiscal  to  million in fiscal  this  million increase is on top of a  million increase from fiscal  to  this  million pretax increase over  years is a significant headwind to earnings financial results for the quarter also included unfavorable also included unfavorable tax adjustments resulting in a very low effective tax rate which compared to a normalized tax rate impacted the quarter approximately  or  per fully diluted share the tax adjustments related to  items first the  year expiration of outof themoney stock options now requires us to write off the deferred tax asset that was created over the vesting period in quarter that the options expire which was march because the tax deduction will not get realized due to the expiration this was approximately  in tax expense and the second item a reduction in the full year expected effective year rate which includes the loss of the manufacturing deduction which resulted in an unfavorable  to tax expense all in the net loss for the second quarter of fiscal  was a net loss of   compared to last year’s second quarter net loss of  outlook for next quarter while the visibility under the pace of the anticipated market recovery is difficult we expect revenue and earnings in the third quarter to be higher than the second quarter of fiscal  backlog was  million at march st  an increase of  million sequentially even with product shipments increasing sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter of fiscal backlog dollars increased due to the order entry rates increasing  updating the backlog number to current the april   backlog increased from  million to  million and increase of  million was  increase driven by solid april order entry cash flow and liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was  million for the first  months of fiscal  and capital expenditures were  million for a positive free cash flow inventory increased over the month period as we carefully manage inventory levels in light of increasing order entry rates which we expect will position us well for when our markets recover our cash balance was  million including restricted cash and our revolver balance remained at  borrowings going forward in the fiscal year we expect cash balances to increase our strong balance sheet positions us well for capital allocation opportunities and future value creation in conclusion while this quarter’s financial results were unfavorable we are encouraged by the improving order entry rates and backlog levels as well as the improvement in base business demand in our markets and across the specialty metals industry mark i will now turn the discussion back over to you mark comerford thanks dan i hope we laid out a pretty good view of what we’re seeing in the business right now i’m enormously disappointed with the loss we generated during the quarter but i’m also encouraged that we’re starting to see better and order entry as we move deeper into  i think you all know we’re in front of customers constantly and our market position is very solid i think the aerospace run rate and the pickup in igt bear that out as does the increase in our tolling and return of some of the relatively dormant applications in our other market areas as well as cpi i think you know cpi always concerns me it’s without a doubt without a doubt the area where we see the most volatility and the most market skirmishes on a weekly and even daily basis it’s one of the reasons we spend so much time developing new applications with our customers so we can have that solid element of differentiation and quoting a broader bill of materials overall broadly pricing is soft right now as it always is at this stage of the cycle but with the stronger order entry levels i think we’re addressing it early and appropriately i’m still not happy with our transactional business levels transactional business is kind of the unexpected orders that indicate that a customer might have been caught short on the material needs we haven’t seen that pick up yet let alone strengthening and i think all of you know that to me that’s one my biggest indicators of whether or not markets are truly strengthening a lot of the order entry we’ve had in second quarter of ‘ as dan mentioned even in april it’s for longer term it’s like blanket types of requirements it’s not the kind of orders all the time all the time that come in and go out inside the same month as we would define as transactional as a result i still feel this recovery could have some fits and starts associated with it i don’t think we’re out of the woods yet it makes giving me that firm guidance very difficult i think you know we count on that transactional business to be transactional business to be about  of our business as we enter a month so just to give you a rough idea when we enter a month we expect roughly  of our business is not booked yet and we expect that  to come in transactionally and when things are getting busy it goes up to  and even over  of our business in a solid up cycle lately it’s been less than  and occasionally down into the  types of levels and just to give you an idea april was a very difficult transactional business month it came in right about  of revenue we don’t have the final numbers april yet but i don’t like what i saw in april i like what i saw in order entry i don’t like what i saw in the shipping level again we’re seeing orders coming in for longerterm orders people reserving their place in the queue but we’re not seeing that stronger transactional that stronger transactional volume yet i’m seeing a lot of call reports though a lot of activity on special projects we’re booking some small projects right now as a matter of fact and we’re quoting some substantial ones as i mentioned to you especially in the chemical process area we’ll keep you posted on those as we move ahead when i look at the record run rate in an era when a decent quarter in igt is strengthening and other markets and – all with increasing backlogs and even that cpi it seems to have made a little bit of a bounce off the bottom although it’s an awfully low bottom i’m encouraged and i think i mentioned to you last time and i still feel this way i feel better about the business today than i did a year ago a year ago we were in the black and making money but i didn’t like where the order book was and i didn’t like what i was hearing from customers and it’s kind of the kind of the opposite now we’re kind of in that in between area where volumes are starting to come through and now we’ve got to clear out some of the lowerpriced items and get our pricing and our mix back to where we want it to be as we look forward i need to see that transactional business pick up and we need to see more of that project workflow from the designer or a prototype phase into actual application wins before i feel that we’re really entering in a solid up cycle with that donna let’s open up the call to questions questionandanswer session operator thank you before as now open for questions operator instructions our is our first question is coming from edward marshall of sidoti  company please go ahead edward marshall hey guys good morning how are you mark comerford good morning edward edward marshall so i want to talk about the weak transactional orders that you kind of just highlighted and wondering if i can get your sense as to maybe what might be causing that is there any industry capacity or underabsorption of the utilization out there is there additional stock in the channel i guess the bigger question is is there a potential it’s hard to talk about spot and transactional in this manner but any loss of market share in that particular environment mark comerford i’ll tell you what ed when i look at it just the first thing you do is you start with the data and you see the  million pound run rate in aerospace so – again it’s a record run rate and remember too our record year was  i don’t think any of our peers had their record rates in aerospace in  i think most people have to go back to  or  for record run rates and as i mentioned the mix wasn’t great so i think there’s even more aerospace out there for us once things stabilize you’re seeing – i think we’re starting to see the aerospace come back i heard some of the guys on the forging side talk about how busy they were which again that usually leads us a little bit so i’m real pleased and i think we’re real well positioned there moving to igt just to give you an idea and i’m sure you’ll look at the numbers in the q i think we saw close to a  sequential lift in the pounds shipped in igt a lot of it was heavier section materials so you saw the pricing not particularly great but for us to be able to respond to a  increase in the quarter was really really good work by a lot of people in the service centers and plants but more importantly it says to me there’s no share loss there we’re in good shape you know where i am on cpi cpi is constant skirmishes and the fact that we’re still below  million pounds in the quarter bothers me but i don’t hear anybody out there right now screaming from the rafters that their cpi business is fantastic i’m hearing guys talk about the oil and gas finally coming back and i love hearing that it says investment’s coming back and also where i get concerned is i think it also means the supply chain is refilling itself and i’d rather hear more about the pullthrough demand and remember we own our distribution system so our distribution system we kind of keep levelloaded that’s how we were able to respond to things like that  jump in igt so we don’t really get as much of a feel for when the distributors restock we’re our own distributors so we don’t get that extra bump all the time but cpi is where i am concerned the most our european operations on the cpi side i’d be lying to you if i didn’t tell you they were impacted by the stronger dollar but again it’s not like i’m seeing a ton of lost projects i mentioned one last quarter and there’s constant skirmishes but everybody i talk to every customer i meet with we’re still in great shape on cpi in fact i had some chemical people in last quarter right before the call and actually some of them are coming back in next week and we’re talking about some new applications in cpi i think we’re in good shape i think we’re just still seeing a chemical business that’s just way off from peak oil and gas the small business we do there and the other things that we call in our other markets are starting to rebound we’re starting to see some of those applications come back to life i don’t think fgd is ever going to be what it was  or  years ago that was a  million a year market for haynes back in those days and in the last  years it’s been a  million to  million market range i think that’s where it’s going to be but we’re picking up some new applications in that other market area especially oil and gas and some consumer applications as well as some medical applications that have really really helped us out and you know the story on the tolling the tolling really bounced nice for us in this most recent quarter second best in the company’s history and we’re still very busy on the tolling side of the business i hope that gives you a little bit of where i feel we are in market share edward marshall it does and when i think about   rates of  quarterly rates of transaction business in the quarter what specific market is generally stronger and leading that  to  as opposed to where you are right now mark comerford usually you’ll see that aerospace customer who used to take in about  pounds a month or something like that he’ll coming in for  or  that’s when we know they’re starting to really rebuild that supply chain i think the aerospace supply chain  good news is i think the aerospace supply chain is still pretty lean same thing with igt igt and cpi have been off at such low levels now for plus years that if we just start to see a little bit and i think i said to you ed and i’ve said on the call if i can get those markets to move up absolutely horrible to just bad boy we’d see a real nice volume and a real nice absorption pickup and probably more so than anything i know we’re capable of handling that volume edward marshall and you talked about prior that base volume recovery of the commodity materials into cpi is typically the beginning of a healthy recovery do you feel that way right now i know it’s  i know you’ve got to be brave to say it but mark comerford i think i’d feel great about anything in cpi when i’m still running  i think last quarter was andsome thousand pounds and this quarter was  i like that number over  million pounds and i’m just not – it’s funny we’re starting to see like we’ve – i mentioned that we’re working on some project work and that’s really what we need to see bust out for some of the baseline volume to come through and not just for us when we pick up pound project work that means some of the bigger mills are doing some of the lowerpriced highervolume alloys when we pick up  pounds or something like that the bigger mills are going to be picking up  or  pounds which is great you start to see everybody load up and we’re really in touch with all the projects that are out there right now and we’re quoting it’ll be whether or not we see those projects get let and if they get let i think we’re in good position to pick them up so i’m confident from the point of view ed that the quotation activity is great but i’d be lying to you if i told you i had a great order book on the cpi side edward marshall and then finally if i look at your volume for the quarter of  million you seem like you’re off about  from the peak volumes i just kind of wanted to get your feet on that is that optically it looks closer than what probably the results feel i know it was probably a weaker mix so you probably had maybe more billet in there but maybe kind of talk about what the potentiality of peak kind of volumes could be at this – at haynes relative to kind of where you are right now mark comerford what i’d like to tell people is when we’re in that million to million pound range we’re hovering around breakeven it depends on whether or not you run out of days in the quarter typically or if somebody asked you to hold an order back or something a lot of times when we get into the  million pounds we start making money and when we get up to  million pounds that’s when we start making hay again i think these markets are growing and i think they will grow i think you’ve got a situation in oil – i mean oil and gas at least the rig count is finally getting back to what i call normal i mean it’s still – if you ask me the rig count has what almost doubled from the low point it was down to  rigs and i think it’s up around the  or  rigs now and i’d like to call normal up around  and i think the last peak was up around  and i think that drives a lot of investment but we’re still at real low levels operating levels and i think most people would tell you in igt we’re still in low operating levels and in chemical i think we’re in very historic low operating levels and in chemical i think we’re in very historic low operating levels so i think there’s a lot of room left to run on the upside edward marshall got it thanks very much operator thanks our next question is coming from chris olin from longbow research please go ahead chris olin hi good morning mark comerford good morning chris dan maudlin good morning chris chris olin i just want to make sure i understand the mix issue within aerospace and exactly what created this unfavorable mix for january does this imply jet engine demand was weak that month or i’ve also heard that from some other companies that the mro business was unusually strong early in the year i guess what are your thoughts there and then also can you talk a little bit about what was going on in the tubing business and how that influences mix mark comerford i’ll tell you what let me start with the tubing business the tubing business for us typically in aerospace the bulk of ours is in the hydraulics systems and just to let you know we’re doing very very well there that business is up pretty dramatically over last year in fact i was just checking the numbers and the way i look at that is typically the key accounts that we saw and i was just looking at that those numbers as a matter of fact yesterday and i was very happy with the numbers i’m seeing in that area so that’s doing extremely well when you talk about what happened last quarter i think the best way for me to explain it chris is i tend to look at the alloys that we’re selling inside of – when i’m inside of a market so for instance if i’m seeing a lot of our proprietary materials or our patented materials going out i know i’m going to see a good mix and i’m going to see a great pricing now the other alloys what we call commodity are still very highpriced alloys but there are lowpriced alloys at haynes they’re highpriced alloys for some of our peers and as i looked at last quarter especially late in the quarter i saw a lot of sales of some of what i call our lowerend alloys more competitive alloys as opposed to the proprietary materials those lowerend alloys it’s good to see that volume coming through it’s great to see that volume coming through because a lot of those go into combusters or seals or rings for applications which means okay great we’re starting to see more of a demand more of a pullthrough on the engine building side whereas the proprietary alloys are typically for real hot sections very niche applications inside the engine where let’s face it people don’t want to buy those alloys unless they have an immediate order to get the product they’re manufacturing back out because they’re very expensive alloys but what it says to me is the demand for those alloys should be coming because again i don’t think people are buying these higher volume alloys just have parts sitting around i think they’re going to want to start assembling the whole thing and putting it through so i’m kind of giving you a stretch on that but the way i really look at it is the best way to think about it is a lot of the highervalue higherpriced materials that haynes would normally sell in an even mix type of aerospace quarter was really diluted by what we saw as far as a lot of i’ll say the highervolume lowerpriced alloys that go into aerospace chris olin does some of that highvolume alloy business is that what goes to the forging channel first mark comerford we don’t ship a lot into the forging channel so a lot of what we would manufacture goes to guys that are going to form products out of it so they might go somewhere and a guy will stamp it or laser cut it sometimes we laser cut it or waterjet cut it and then it gets welded and formed into a product as opposed to the – more of the alleghenys or carpenter or even special metals of the world would ship the large ingots that go to be it a wymangordon or someone like that to make the big shafts or somebody else for the blades and the forged types of products the rotating products chris olin helpful last question can you just give us a bit of a progress report on the introduction of haynes  alloy and where we’re at now mark comerford i think what i mentioned the last time we got together – it’s funny if you came to me a couple of years ago i would watch defense sales and that’s where we saw it i mean it was just everywhere in defense speced into the pratt  whitney  now so we’re seeing a lot of supply of that product going into that supply chain and i think you’re well aware there are some fits and starts in that supply chain so we might have a very heavy shipping quarter of it and then all of a sudden we back off a little bit i will tell you that the forecast for the product look very good we’re very much encouraged by interesting thing about haynes  and i mentioned it i think each of the last two quarters is it’s been about  of revenue in our igt business because it’s been very well accepted again for people that have either fabrication issues using highertemperature materials or just looking for material that has excellent strength at a higher operating temperature some of the other alloys actually have better strength at lower temperatures  haynes  has excellent highstrength capability at higher operating temperatures so we’ve actually won quite a few applications in the gas turbine side with  in addition to the aerospace so it’s doing quite well i want to say last year it was somewhere near double the year before i don’t think it will double again this year but i think it’s – a lot of it’s going to depend on the supply chain for the pratt  whitney  i think how it’ll do this year but it’s – we’re very pleased with what we’ve had from the alloy chris olin okay thank you mark comerford and by the way there’s another alloy out there chris too haynes  it’s a steel alloy which has excellent highstrength characteristics compared to  even higher temperature capabilities than  excellent coefficient of expansion capabilities and if you think of things like thermospan  and now  is out there so it’s another excellent alloy that we’ve got out in the market operator operator instructions our next question is coming from tyler kenyon of keybanc capital markets please go ahead tyler kenyon hey good morning mark and dan mark comerford good morning dan maudlin good morning tyler kenyon first question here i guess we’ve seen some interesting dynamics at play here more recently just on the side of raw materials alloy cost up pretty materially while nickel is weakening aggressively again here how does that mix interplay with the pricecost match as we move forward here dan maudlin well certainly this was a big issue that we wrestled with last year and that was a  million compression on gross margins across the whole fiscal year and then we’ve kind of started this fiscal year saying nickelneutral and for the most part that holds true but we were talking nickelneutral at nickel prices near  a pound of course they have floated down since then so that reduction and that floating down over the quarter that hurts the alignment as you might assume so that does have an unfavorable impact on us it’s not material but if it keeps floating down it can certainly become a headwind like it did last year i wouldn’t say we’re necessarily neutral right now but we’re near neutral mark comerford yes and on the other side of the collar as far as i think you know that we make adjustments to our price book essentially weekly so the spike you’ve been seeing in indiscernible and some of the other materials those are in the price book we talk it over with customers and we say we’re sorry we don’t own the mines so we have to make those adjustments so transactional business gets it immediately and then based on contracts price letters et cetera other adjustments are made either monthly quarterly some are made annually so as dan has often said we are kind of metal value long because of our supply chain so you can get hurt a little bit in the short run but again it gets back to like an area under the curve type of situation tyler kenyon okay got it and just with respect to some of the price increases you’ve announced on the transactional side i would imagine some of that has to do with just some of the moving pieces we just discussed but how much of your business would this apply to and would it have any impact on some of the existing ltas that you have out there mark comerford yes contracts come up and you renegotiate them you push through to get the increases but you’re right it goes right into the transactional business immediately and we talk about like i said transactional business right now is  or so and we’re in that situation right now right volumes are increasing dan gave you the backlog look and just to give you an idea i think it was march was the best order entry month we’ve had in over a year and april was just a hair below march but again i said on the shipping side i wasn’t happy with what i saw in april but order was excellent in april but we’re in that kind of inbetween area now where we’ve got to flush out some lower priced items get the mix back looking the way we want it to look and start to push some of these products through over the next quarter or  to kind of restore the profitability and get things going again so i think it’s going to be a little bit of a long slog as we go through it but hopefully in giving you a long answer to your question but the fact that we pushed through the pricing largely march  and then we saw great order entry in march and excellent order entry in april we’re very encouraged dan maudlin because that’s one of the key things when a market starts to recover if we don’t get pretty quick with the price increase we fill up our backlog with very low priced products and that will take us  or  quarters to flush all that out so we had to be very careful not to do that so when the market recovers it’s a decent pricing certainly volume is a good thing for us right now but pricing is not so we needed that to turn around quite quickly tyler kenyon and when you think about just some of the projectoriented business as a whole i mean i know you mentioned seeing some improvements just in the quoting but that’s for probably some longerterm business could you speak perhaps to any differences that you might be seeing just with respect to the dynamics you’re seeing in maybe the us projectoriented business versus what you might be seeing internationally mark comerford yes typically what we’ve been seeing has s projects are still continuing to flow through so there are some neat technologies that are coming through especially on the chemical side but the projects have been like for instance we had one that flowed through last quarter and quarter before i want to say it was probably close to  million project on essentially incineration type of application a really neat project but a smaller might be best way to put it excellent projects but those are the types of projects that we’ll get a couple of them here and there and they’re  million  million  million’s an excellent one where some of the international projects that we’ve seen and i’m going now over let’s say the last  years some of the international projects that we’ve been getting have just been monstrous we had one couple of years ago that was  million we had one a couple of years ago that ran into last year and part of this year that was over  million so the magnitude you see in some of the projects is quite different a lot of the domestic projects include a lot of materials not only our proprietary materials but we’ll also see a lot of activity for some of the lowerpriced highervolume materials that go along with it we’ll get the entire project might be the best way to put it and some of the international projects that we’ve been doing lately have had some – have largely been proprietary materials very very – real good pricing on those proprietary materials because of the complexity of the application dan maudlin okay thank you i’m jump back into you operator thank you at this time i’d like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comment mark comerford thanks very much for your time today really appreciate your support of haynes and your interest in haynes i did also want to mention for those of you who may not have known our cfo marcel martin who retired a few years back passed away during the quarter and god bless marcel we miss him horribly and he did some great things at haynes international so again thanks very much for your time today and we look forward to updating you next

name  required email  required phone  required question or comments submit wednesday october   trademarks and service marks a trademark or service mark is a word name logo symbol or design that identifies the source of a product or service distinguishing it from the competition while trademarks are used to identify products service marks are used to identify services both marks are afforded the same protections and subject to the same requirements to qualify for trademark protection the mark must be used in commerce and it must be distinctive trademark law is tied to the power of congress to regulate interstate commercetherefore to qualify for federal trademark protection a mark must be used in interstate commerce marks used in intrastate commerce are eligible for state trademark protection if a mark is not being used in commerce at the time a trademark application is filed the mark may still be registered if you can establish a good faith intent to use the trademark in commerce on a future date nevertheless trademark rights are awarded to the first individual or entity to actually use the mark in commerce the trademark must also be sufficiently distinctive to identify and distinguish the goods or services from those of other sources distinctiveness generally falls within one of four categories  arbitrary or fanciful  suggestive  descriptive and  generic a trademark categorized as arbitrary or fanciful or suggestive is automatically considered to be inherently distinctive and the exclusive right to use the mark is determined solely based on who was first to use the mark in commerce descriptive trademarks are only protected if the mark has acquired secondary meaning to members of the public  if the mark merely describes the type of product or service it will not stand out and leave an impression in the minds of consumers generic terms are ineligible for any trademark protection a trademark may be generic at the outset or it can become generic over time through common usage such as “aspirin” trademarks can be registered at either the federal or state level depending on whether the product or service will be sold across state lines or within one state only registration is not required for trademark protection but there are significant advantages to registration registration puts the public on notice that the mark is used to identify a particular good or service under federal law a registered trademark can achieve incontestable status following five years of continuous useunder state law in most jurisdictions even unregistered trademarks are protected under unfair competition laws trademarks that are registered at the federal level are permitted to use the ® designation absent registration with the us patent and trademark office trademark owners can use the letters “tm” or “sm” in conjunction with the mark to alert the public of the owner’s claim to the mark trademark owners are obligated to protect the mark by taking legal action against any infringers regardless of how insignificant the infringement may seem owners must be consistent in asserting and defending their rights to the mark failure to do so could result in a waiver of the right to enforce the mark   permalink subscribe via rss previous posts a primer on advance medical directivesthe difference between equal and equitable
