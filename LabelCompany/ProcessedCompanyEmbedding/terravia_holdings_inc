identified and initiated a platform for microalgaebased oil production the company then expanded focus on skin and personal care products solazyme continued development of the algal molecular biology platform in  key microalgae strains were identified to produce oil that could be easily converted into fuels and chemicals through this process solazyme coincidentally discovered an extract from algae that demonstrated an ability to increase cell regeneration and to reduce inflammation while protecting from uv light damage and thereby creating alguronic acid the company later expanded its focus to include nutrition solazyme soladiesel shown in the company laboratory in september  solazyme received a  million grant from the national institute of standards and technology signed a joint development agreement with chevron through its division chevron technology ventures began operating in commercially sized standard industrial fermentation equipment liter scale worked with a third party refiner to demonstrate the compatibility of the oil with standard refining equipment and produced over  liters of microalgaebased oils in january  solazyme was featured in fields of fuel which was played at the sundance film festival in park city utah at the event it presented a mercedes benz c fueled with its soladiesel brand of algal fuel also in january  the company announced a partnership with chevron technology ventures to explore the commercialization of algal fuel later that year the company stated that it had produced the worlds first jet fuel derived from an algal source in  solazyme was awarded approximately  million from the united states department of energy for the construction of an integrated biorefinery project it also formed a contract with the united

solazyme announced a joint venture with agribusiness company bunge limited to develop renewable oils in brazil using solazymes algaebased sugartooil technology in april  solazyme and bunge announced a plan to construct a shared commercialscale production facility in brazil as one of the worlds largest vegetable oil distributors bunge would supply the facility with sugarcane feedstock from its sugarcane processor in brazil for use in solazymes algae oil production process construction of the new facility began in june  and in may  the joint venture plant began oil production in late  solazyme and bunge announced an expansion of their joint venture which included an agreement to have bunge market the food oils produced through the joint venture the production of algaprime dha was announced in may  and is the first product under the joint venture of terravia and bunge algaprime dha is a new algaebased specialty feed ingredient designed to reduce the aquaculture industrys dependence on wild fish populations terraviaedit solazyme officially changed its name to terravia holdings inc in march  with a redefined focus on food nutrition and personal care as part of the change the company stated that its previous fuel and industrial oil products and workings would operate under solazyme industrials technologyedit terravia uses an innovative approach to grow microalgae which allows the production process to be extremely efficient in terms of cost scale time and sustainability in contrast to common open pond and photo bioreactor approaches terravia grows microalgae in the dark inside huge stainlesssteel containers these enclosed fermentation tanks offer control purity and consistency for the fermentation process as well as provide the opportunity for microalgae to be produced in a diversity of geographies and seasons the algae can be fed a wide variety of renewable plantbased sugars also known as feedstock flexible and the potential feedstocks include sugarcanebased sucrose cornbased dextrose sugar beets and green waste the algae then convert the sugar into oils lipids and proteins which can be used in a variety of applications such as food ingredients and cosmetics the majority of terravias products are produced at the joint venture facility with bunge in sao paulo brazil this facility utilizes bonsucro certified sugarcane as a feedstock which is grown onsite by bunge at the facility the sugarcane byproducts known as bagasse are used to generate power to run the entire plant excess power is sent to the local grid this makes the algae production process extremely efficient with very little energy going to waste products and brandsedit foodedit in  solazyme launched its first products the golden chlorella line of dietary supplements as part of a market development initiative products incorporating golden chlorella can be found at retailers including whole foods market and general nutrition centers alongside its efforts in the fuels and cosmetics industries solazyme began development of a food ingredient line known as algavia algavia was launched in  and received gras certification the same year with the company change in march  terravia acquired algavia as well as algawise another food ingredient brand the algavia brand provides food manufacturers with two whole algae powders that offer sustainable nonallergenic vegan protein and lipids as the name suggests the whole algae powders use the entire algae cell which is ground up into a fine powder algavias lipidrich whole algae powder is intended to add texture and reduce the need for dairy eggs and oils in recipes the proteinrich whole algae powder is intended to offer an allergen and glutenfree source of vegan protein the algawise brand sells algaebased food oils algawise features two different oils optimized for monounsaturated fat content or stability algawise ultra omega algae oil offers over  percent monounsaturated fat and less than  percent saturated fat terravia boasts that the oil has an extremely high smoke point and a neutral taste making it good for frying and searing algawise high stability algae oil is intended to resist oxidation and reduce the need for preservatives and extra stabilizing ingredients algavia and algawise supply algaebased ingredients to food manufacturers such as south coast baking company follow your heart and so delicious dairy free terravia is also responsible for the thrive algae oil brand thrive is marketed as the best oil for your heart due to its high levels of monounsaturated fats which are known to decrease bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke thrive has been praised by food industry professionals for its neutral taste versatility and high smoke point the gelsons grocery chain began supplying thrive to the los angeles area in  due to its success in this market terravia announced it would expand the distribution of thrive throughout the west coast in may  aquacultureedit as part of its joint venture with bunge limited terravia supplies aquaculture feed producer biomar with an algaebased feed ingredient known as algaprime dha algaprime dha is a source of dha omega fatty acid which is intended to reduce the aquaculture industrys dependence on wild fish as a source of dha algaprime dha therefore has the potential to boost the sustainability of aquaculture and allow the aquaculture industry to grow in spite of the worlds fixed supply of oceanbased dha personal careedit terravia currently manufactures the algenist brand for the luxury skin care market through marketing and distribution arrangements with sephora and qvc it is sold in canada france and the united kingdom the idea of using algae for a skincare line came

terravia holdings tvia kevin quon insider ownership smallcap longterm horizon dividend investinginvesting in the lives of otherssummaryterravia has suspended its supply of ingredients to the maker of soylentthe customer had not provided any evidence of a meaningful investigation to support throwing terravia under the bus for its latest troublesterravia has also successfully defended the intellectual property for these ingredients through an appeal process pursued by former joint venture partner roquette freres sato say that microalgae ingredients specialist terravia holdings tvia has seen its unfair share of roadblocks remains an understatement worthy of reflection many years from now yet for today the leading provider of algae ingredients and tailored algal oils has once again managed to defend its leading product platform from opponents on multiple sides as the company looks forward to ramp up the production of its many ingredients it has also taken the bold step of protecting its reputation by going on the offensive and dropping a troublesome customer at the same time the company has received a favorable ruling regarding the exclusive ownership of its intellectual property in the present terravia appears to be a struggling company that is worthy of longterm speculation but surrounded by nearterm uncertainties in the past few days terravia has released two press releases referring to two separate issues that the company has surely wished had never occurred in the first place these press releases can be found here and here while the court decision was a strong victory for terravia the loss of soylent as a partner was bittersweet by publicly shaming soylent terravia was effectively throwing down the gauntlet in an admirable maneuver to defend some of its key ingredients terravia needed to go on the offensive in order to clear its ingredients reputation after a poorly handled deflection by soylent soylent was publicly accusing algae flour to be the source of its problems by effectively blaming terravias flagship ingredient made by the only producer of that product soylent was also knowingly attacking terravia as such terravia has now responded by cutting its supply chain to soylent this also included cutting off ingredients that were not cited to be problematic ie algal oil and which are vital to some of soylents other products let us quickly recap on these current difficulties on the one hand terravias former joint venture partner roquette has continued to pursue legal action in an attempt to escape its guilty verdict for trying to steal terravias intellectual property used to create algae ingredients on the other hand one of terravias most attentiongrabbing customers was quick to publicly blame algae flour when significantly less than  of its customers began to assert that particular product caused adverse reactions therefore with a touch of irony while one of terravias opponents has aggressively attempted to grab the value found in terravias ingredients another has publicly suggested that these ingredients have no value in order to deflect its current woes over some unexplained nausea experienced by a fraction of its customers the soylent problem to understand why terravia felt it was necessary to suspend its supply of ingredients to rosa labs the producer of soylent its important to first understand some context as a brand soylent has thrived on the notoriety of its name which shares an iconic reference to a future food made from dead people it was in its success to convert that negative connotation into a sticky awareness for its brand as a novel food supplement that has made rosa labs the target it is today image source by branding its product the way it did popular media was only all too happy to share their doubts for the bold product and the majority of opinions provided skepticism waiting for that itoldyouso moment in which a misstep by soylent would spiral into its imminent failure as such soylent was derided when problems arose and its popularity grew regardless as public interest remained intrigued and expectations remained low as long as editorial opinions remained just opinions negative publicity actually grew the brand yet when rosa labs reacted to a perceived problem found in its new food bars and powder it directed a negative light on itself in a way that it was unable to spin away simply put the public began to believe that soylent as a brand was causing people to get sick more so the rapid response to pull down the food bars and powder in order to reformulate them heightened the fear that this was a real significant problem and that the company was unable to control it negative publicity was now affecting sales image source rosa labs has rapidly grown and its future success continues to rest on its ability to capitalize on its ongoing sales momentum the company only recently became profitable and its ability to grow and survive is determined by its ability to rapidly scale for example rosa labs posted on its blog how it was able to price soylents unit cost the way it has based on its sales projections therefore any extended disruption to the sales momentum could have a meaningful impact on the direction of the company overall and to the viability of its products it was in this context that the rosa labs needed to find something to blame as soon as possible in order to prevent lengthy disruptions only a few new ingredients were added into its new food bars so it would be believable that removing one or some of these ingredients would address the problem there is little doubt that the idea of algae as a food ingredient also shared some negative connotations of its own the ability to divert all of soylents negative attention onto algae may have seemed to be an easy course of action was algae really the issue while terravia has strongly protested that it has been wrongly accused for the adverse food reactions that caused some of soylents consumers to have gastrointestinal issues popular media had already begun to accept this theory as truth the damage it was now causing to the brand of terravias ingredients forced terravias hand to go on the offensive in its press release terravia quoted a food industry expert who clearly stated there simply was no evidence for rosa labs to single out a particular ingredient in light of its complex mixture the inability for rosa labs to provide data to support its accusations to terravia also provides some skepticism it also suggested that rosa labs had indeed failed to conduct a thorough investigation an even more intriguing look into the discussion board post that prompted this public spat also suggests that food sensitivities to one particular ingredient arent even the issue at all this is an argument that would go against what rosa labs is publicly accusing a compilation of the complaints can be found in the discussion board post found here of the  documented reports it is key to note that the majority of the claims have also reported having no problems eating the soylent food bars in prior experiences this stands as a rather stark red flag when one evaluates whether a particular food ingredient is the root cause of a food sensitivity or allergic reaction it makes little sense for a person that is sensitive to a particular food ingredient to go through numerous instances of a product without issues but later find one particular experience to suddenly be troubling this is more indicative of some form of contamination or a poor formulation of a particular batch some of these responses can be found in the graphic below image based on comments found here regardless of soylents logic to blame terravias ingredients investors of terravia now find themselves burdened by the hassle of a disrupted reputation it has even caused at least one contributor writer to predict that this fiasco could be the end of the company itself while this claim seems rather premature in my own opinion there is no denying that it has put terravia in a less than ideal position soylent was one of the fastest adopters of algae flour and undoubtedly served as one of its most highprofile clients revealed thus far while simple math based on volumes would suggest that the company wasnt a meaningful contributor of revenue to terravia the brand served as a first impression for those who may have never heard of algae ingredients before in the end the need for rosa labs to blame shift may have caused meaningful damage to the reputation of one or several of terravias flagship products the real question investors should now be asking is if this experience has severely disrupted the future products that more reputable companies have been in the process of developing as noted in this food navigator article found here larger companies put in far more development time than rosa labs did in order to prevent the very issues that arose in the companys food bars on average the development cycle takes two to three years with the majority of terravias partners now undergoing this development process to incorporate the companys food ingredients investors may simply never know how many have been set back because of these accusations by soylent the third times the charm concerning the issue revolving around roquette freres sa terravia has now undergone several years of litigation in order to protect its intellectual property from this former partner roquette has now argued before an arbitration panel and failed it had subsequently pursued a favorable lower court decision and failed roquette then subsequently filed an appeal and has now officially failed the opinion of the us court of appeals for the third circuit can be found here with roquettes legal options now dwindling investors in terravia should be much more assured that the company is on a solid foundation for protecting its monopoly over these unique algae ingredients in the outcome of this appeals process terravia will now strengthen its intellectual property the company is to gain all of the patent applications filed on behalf of solazyme roquette nutritionals it will also gain all of the knowhow developed by srn for high lipid algae flour and high protein algae protein in addition the company will receive all of roquettes patent applications filed since november  regarding microalgae food and food ingredients last of all the original arbitration panel judgment required that roquette pay terravia  million in legal costs and fees and this was upheld in the courts decision while the results of this case may seem miniscule at first the longerterm implications are much more important investors should bear in mind that terravia has developed a unique set of algae ingredients that are highly differentiated because of their favorable taste color functionality profile etc one of the primary reasons that microalgae has not been fully explored as a food ingredient has been because of these underlying barriers whereas traditional chlorella a type of common algae used in supplements would taste fishy and have a green color terravias production process allows a much greater degree of flexibility the company can grow algae in a fermentation process to increase the amount of fat or protein and it can mask some of the issues found in color and taste in doing so terravias process enables a more versatile and functional ingredient that can be incorporated without detection by the average consumer protected by its intellectual property shield the company has been able to control an effective monopoly as the sole supplier of these ingredients a loss to roquette would have led to an unnecessary duopoly this is important as algae is only now beginning to permeate throughout the shopping aisles of grocery stores it is widely believed that brands are just beginning to realize the favorable properties of microalgae as a new food ingredient a look at terravia now terravia now trades with a market capitalization of  million based on its last share price of  as of december  terravia has been in an extended decline as the company continues to accrue losses in light of limited production to date much of the companys revenue is still derived from research and development and its limited product revenue has actually declined from  million in q  to  million in q  terravias net loss has also declined in a more meaningful fashion this past year as the company sought to tighten its expenses this can be seen in the graphic above while losses are expected to continue for some time the company has been effective at extending the life of its cash reserves at the end of  terravia had  million in cash and marketable securities by the end of september  the company had  million in cash and marketable securities remaining the partial divestment of algenist over the past year has helped to limit the loss in cash while actual product sales have been slow to date due to manufacturing issues and lengthy development cycles sales are expected to increase over the coming year as the company advances several of its product lines at its joint venture plant in brazil investors should bear in mind that the majority of the companys sales at this primary facility will not likely revolve around the ingredients mentioned over the past two press releases based on the companys q  earnings call it appears that a greater emphasis will be placed upon larger campaigns prioritized by algapur and algaprime dha instead as such personal care oils and ingredients for animal nutrition will be the primary emphasis for the company in the near term ongoing introductions for algavia algae powders will continue to be a longerterm ambition as lengthy product development cycles and adoption cycles limit a nearterm contribution from this segment final thoughts despite the companys new found focus on food ingredients and specialty personal care ingredients the nearterm ramifications of a damaged reputation to algavia should have a limited impact on terravia for now investors should consider terravia to be a personal care ingredient provider and a supplier of animal nutrition products even the companys successful food oil brand of thrive is unlikely to make a significant difference in comparison to what algaprime and algapur are expected to accomplish through moema in the short term because the production facility in brazil maintains a manufacturing capacity nearly  times that of the companys smaller facility dedicated to food ingredients the corresponding economic impact for food ingredients is likely to remain relatively small for some time there is little doubt that shareholder interest in the company has significantly dwindled over the past year as marked by the declining share price the continued problems that arise have done little to remind investors of the unique position that terravia actually finds itself in despite being a monopolistic producer of unique and novel ingredients that can be utilized throughout many industries concerns over the companys ability to become profitable based on past performance have significantly affected the companys current share price all the same investors should remember that such judgment is being passed before the company has even begun to truly commercialize its primary products which it expects to do over the coming year as an investor in terravia i myself plan to continue holding my position for the extended longterm i am reminded that over a dozen years have been put into the development of the companys platform and the hurdles that management now face appear to be far from as challenging as those in the past as an investor i do not doubt that additional capital may be needed in the future which may dilute my position this is a risk that every investor should evaluate on the basis of their own tolerance the value in terravia remains in the longterm future of its current product portfolio the company has the ability to play a meaningful role in the progressive change to a food system that is looking to be healthier more natural and more sustainable what makes terravia stand out is that it has the solution to accomplish each of these without making the sacrifice to critical properties like favorable taste and functionality while the journey to the present has been difficult for investors to bear i find it easy to not lose sight of the future having tried and tasted the companys products

 about terravia holdings tvia kevin quon insider ownership smallcap longterm horizon dividend investinginvesting in the lives of otherssummaryterravia revealed an ongoing ramp of production at its joint venture facility in brazilthe company will see slowing reported revenue due to a heavy focus on its joint venture where revenue is experiencing tripledigit growthterravia expects to see positive ebitda at the joint venture in early animal nutrition and personal care ingredients remain the key target markets for the near futureterravia holdings tvia remains a longterm speculative investment but not one without nearterm uncertainty in the present the company continues to walk a fine line through the balancing act of scaling production at its joint venture facility in brazil and limiting its ongoing cash burn in the near future the company expects to profitably produce product at its owned joint venture facility in brazil through revenue expected to range from  to  million annually by yearend this plant is expected to produce  million up from  million in  at the same time the companys much smaller plant in illinois will continue to incubate the longterm ambitions of its promising pipeline found in food ingredients image source yet today with cash balances continuing to decline amidst losses that are slowly improving terravia is making difficult choices in its quest to make do with less at the core of the issue is how to balance the most profitable product lines in order to achieve the greatest scale efficiencies with the least amount of cash while market commercialization times for the companys new products continue to prove frustrating for investors practical scaling is ultimately proving it necessary for terravia to limit its focus onto two key product lines this remains ideal in order to maximize efficiencies in scale to lower costs and optimize production as a result investors should place their greatest attention on terravias first product lines of algapur and algaprime which will make up the largest volume coming out of the joint venture facility in the immediate future on wednesday terravia announced its earnings results for  shedding further light with an update on the progress now underway in brazil most positively it appears that the joint venture facility is well on its way to scaling commercial production higher after several years of stalled performance due to construction woes and preramp modifications the company reported that the sb oils joint venture tripled revenue to  million in  from a light base figure of  million in  the company is forecasting that revenue will maintain this rapid growth rate to a range of  million to  million in  image source yet with a simultaneous focus on fiscal discipline companyreported revenues outside of the joint venture will continue to shrink to  to  million in  from  million in  the sale of algenist along with the refocus away from industrial oils will continue to put companyreported sales in decline this has the less than ideal circumstance in which revenue is growing in one business area and declining in the other yet aware of its fiscal situation terravia remains focused on reducing operating expenses in the companyowned operations while also sustaining at a minimum a channel for developing its promising pipeline of food ingredients given the amount of attention that has been given to the companys whole algae ingredients culinary oil and algae butter its important for investors to remember that commercial production has been quite limited to date and will be for some time this is particularly the case considering that such production is coming out of the small facility in illinois nevertheless these products should continue to be viewed as playing a critical role for the company in the future as terravia further entrenches itself in a multibillion dollar market for healthy and sustainable food ingredients indeed recent developments prove that terravia is continuing to make enviable progress in its path towards market penetration for its pipeline in late january terravia announced progress with its culinary oil product selling under the brand of thrive the company announced that bon appetit management company would designate the product as its preferred oil thereby spurring on its adoption across the nation in its many highend locations bon appetit operates more than  cafes across  states and serves highquality meals in specialty venues including google university of pennsylvania and the getty center yet more importantly in this new relationship is the fact that bon appetit operates as a subsidiary of compass group cmpgy the worlds largest food service provider partnering with another wellentrenched industry titan terravia continues to slowly expand its reach to the highestvolume consumers of its target markets in one of the most promising developments that was simultaneously announced it was noted that terravia and compass group also entered into a supply agreement via foodbuy the specialty purchasing division of compass group as such the company is likely to begin selling increasing volumes of its product indeed thrive algae was elsewhere seen being distributed in large gallon containers which further supports the thesis that higher volumes are finally beginning to ship image source yet despite the excitement behind the companys food ingredient pipeline for human consumption by and large the real attention must inherently be given to the animal nutrition markets in the near future as noted by the company algaprime dha in particular is expected to be being heavily weighted in terms of production mix at the companys joint venture facility in brazil the product is expected to help drive the joint venture to profitability and market penetration remains key after all by no means is terravia alone in commercializing algaederived omega oils for the fish nutrition market however armed with the largest facilities capable of the highest economies of scale and equipped with a superior product capable of higher dha yields terravia is well positioned to make a meaningful impact in this developing market for algae oil the company recently released a promotional video for algaprime dha found here image source wednesdays announcement of an expanded partnership with biomar further reinforces the direction the company has taken towards addressing this market the relationship with the industry heavyweight continues to prove the increased demand for a new market that can effectively break a reliance on fishbased dha for terravia this budding market appears to hit the ideal sweet spot small fish used for the extraction of omega oils have long hit their supply ceiling and the rising demand for fish reliant on these small fish such as salmon has been steadily growing as aquaculture continues to expand image source terravia now trades with a market capitalization of  million based on the intraday share price of  as of march  as of december  the company had on its books total assets of  million of which total liabilities amounted to  million shareholders deficit increased from  million to  million over the past year cash cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased from  million in  to  million in  it is worth reminding that the company sold a majority stake in algenist this past year however which helped to increase the amount of cash available over  for terravia  will be an important year to further reduce operating expenses on the companyowned side while simultaneously allowing its joint venture to ramp up at its rapid pace it will be a tough challenge for ceo apu mody but one that shouldnt be viewed as improbable or impossible access to capital will be an important part of  however and the ability to divest off noncore assets will be something to watch over the coming year there is no denying that terravia has seen better days but at the same time it is also clear that the company sits on a large mound of untapped value the intellectual property of terravia alone makes the company an attractive buyout target should the situation further deteriorate while this would be a slap in the face to the most dedicated of longterm investors myself included this fact alone continues to warrant an ongoing investment in the company at these levels with multiple commercialized and latestage development products capable of penetrating multibillion dollar industries i personally find that the company should be able to fetch a valuation in excess of  million for those who have followed the companys dramatic saga over the past few years there are few companies that seemed to have had so much going for it and yet fallen so short after half a decade as a public company like watching a dark comedy filled with improbable circumstances terravia has had to endure much hardship a collapsing industry window for financing a partner who turned into a thief multiple shifts in market dynamics new construction failures and relentless activism filled with hypocrisy have all played their part in chipping away at the company once fortified with a strong cash war chest and a revolutionary technology platform the story remains to be told if terravia will be able to fully develop its promising pipeline in the manner in which it truly deserves yet for now growth that has eluded the company for years is finally beginning to take shape the joint venture is on pace for tripledigit revenue growth rates leading to ebitda profitability in early  however the focus of this year will surely be on shoring up the companys balance sheet as well i expect asset sales and a bridge loan in the near future while market skepticism continues to guide share prices lower i personally find myself willing to buy as long as the companys market capitalization remains under  million simply based on its longterm potential this is predicated on companys asset values the quality of the companys partnerships the promising pipeline and products now being commercialized and the over half billion dollars that has already been invested into the companys platform since its inception expectations of positive ebitda for sb oils in  remains the key target announced by management for investors to place their ambitions on longterm investors should also dwell on the idea that terravia owns multiple key ingredients now being commercialized or which exist in late stage development each of these products can individually address multibillion dollar markets on their own while production and market penetration remain current bottlenecks at present in light of falling cash reserves a longterm view on such speculation leaves me willing to stay invested ongoing debt reduction and a potential bridge loan would greatly aid the company in light of its currently restrained growth i expect that we will see some measure to address the issue of capital in the coming year naturally the speculative risk that i personally take is balanced according to my own portfolios stability at present terravia makes up  of my current portfolio designating it as my th largest holding it is a position i am willing to further accumulate in over time but not one that i would want to grow to over  of my portfolio until it proves capable of steady profitability disclosure i amwe are
