connection with ecommerce activity of a user in particular embodiments described herein include a system and method for responding to user ecommerce activity at a particular network site by enabling a client device to retrieve corresponding or relevant product information from a source that is remote to the network siteaccording to embodiments a client device is configured to operate independently of a site on which the ecommerce activity originates in one embodiment the client device is triggered by data contained in the webpage or resource provided from an ecommerce site to retrieve relevant product information from an independent information source more specifically the client device is configured to initiate the retrieval in response to for example the coding contained in a url andor the text that appears on a web pagein some embodiments the client may be provided by way of a plugin for a web browser or other webapplicationaccording to embodiments a browser or other client of the user terminal can be configured to be triggerable by certain types of information or data provided from an ecommerce site or alternatively any ecommerce site the browser or client can be triggered into in retrieving and presenting product information from a remote source of related product information additionally the remote source may be independent of or independently operated from the ecommerce site that triggered the browser or client to perform the retrievalthe data that triggers the client to perform the retrieval may be agnostic as to the presence of the client functionality specific examples of activity that can carry data to trigger the retrieval activity include for example i browsing activity by the user at a particular ecommerce site where the activity specifies by text or code eg product code a particular product ii a user selecting a particular product for additional information such as by viewing pictures are customer reviews of the product iii the user queuing the product in a shopping cart or otherwise initiating selection of the product for purchase andor iv the user providing final input to make purchase of the product eg the user checking out after placing item in shopping cartin connection with a users activity at a particular site some embodiments provide for retrieving and presenting product information to the user from a remote and independent source additionally some embodiments provide for presenting the retrieved product information concurrently with content generated from the ecommerce site in one implementation a mashup is generated to concurrently display the product information from the remote source along with content from the ecommerce site the mashup can be generated in response to the users activity at the ecommerce site eg user selecting a product for purchase by placing it in a shopping cart for example product information from the remote source may be displayed to the user as an overlay flyover or under popup or dynamically generated window or display area adjacent to content provided from the ecommerce sitesome embodiments provide for various types of product information to be presented to the user concurrently with the performance of certain triggering ecommerce activities for example a user may select a merchandise item for purchase by placing a virtual representation of the item in a shopping cart with such functionality the selection mechanism can further extend to when the user “checks out” by selecting to purchase or initiate the process to purchase the items listed in the shopping cart according to embodiments prior to the user completing the transaction a window is concurrently displayed to the user that displays product information relevant to the users purchase in particular embodiments may utilize an identifier or characteristic of the merchandise items selected by the user as a criteria for searching for relevant product information that is then displayed to the user in some fashionsome embodiments described herein may be implemented in the context of a user operating a computer and executing an application such as a browser or alternatively a webapp specific examples of online sources for commercial transactions include online merchant sites eg wwwamazoncom auction sites eg wwwebaycom online retailers and online classified advertisements eg

a clientside browser or web applicationin one embodiment online activity of a user is monitored to detect a users selection or interest in a merchandise item the product identifier of the product is determined and used to query a remote and independent network site to obtain information about the product of information the information about the product of interest is then displayed to the user concurrently eg as a mashup with the page or resource that displays the product of interestaccording to an embodiment a determination is made that a user is interested in a product the determination may be based on a users activity in connection with a first network site embodiments further provide for identifying the product of interest and then using an identifier of that product to generate a query that is communicated to a second network site from which product information is retrieved and presented in this way the query results in the generation of product information that is about or otherwise relevant to the product that is of interest to the userstill further in some embodiments a presentation is generated that concurrently displays i a content generated from an ecommerce site pertaining to the product of interest and ii content that includes product information originating from a second site remote to the ecommerce site that is relevant to the product of interest the presentation may be triggered in response to a particular user activity such as user selection of a merchandise item for purchase eg placement of merchandise item in shopping queue or ‘check out’ therefrom furthermore embodiments provide that product information is based on a product identifier andor characteristic of the selected productamong other benefits embodiments enable users to operate client terminals in connection with ecommerce activities in order to retrieve relevant product information from sites or sources that are independent of the ecommerce source in this way the user has the ability to procure additional information from an information source that has less bias andor provide alternative informationopinion for a product that the user is considering purchasing furthermore the information can be provided to the user automatically in a mashup that preserves the content from the ecommerce site so as to not interrupt or disturb the users ecommerce activityone

for presenting product information to users in connection with ecommerce transactions and activities according to embodiments a system such as described by fig  may be implemented on a usercomputing environment such as through a web browser executing on a user computing device eg desktop machine laptop tablet mobile computing device etc a webbased application or plugin for a browser or other application accordingly some embodiments provide that a system  may be implemented through functional elements that execute within an application such as by way of a plugin or programming resource that executes within a browser or web application of a user devicein an embodiment of fig  system  is implemented as a plugin  within a commercially available browser  eg mozilla the plugin  or programming resource may be downloaded from for example a site that is independent of the ecommerce sites where the user performs ecommerce activity to receive the functionality of the plugin according to at least some embodiments the plugin  may include functionality corresponding to a trigger logic  content analysis  product detector  product information retrieval  and content integration  in operation browser  executes to download webpages  from websites where products are offered for sale typically an ecommerce site offers merchandise items along with local content that includes product information such as manufacturer provided product information and customer reviews from customers of the site who previously purchased the product the manufacturer supplied information can include pictures specifications dimensions weight material technical specifications and other content the customer reviews may include ratings additionally some sites offer recommendations to other products based on for example a knowledge as to what other products viewers of one item have previously been interested inin one embodiment trigger logic  processes a designated data input  in order to respond to a triggering event or condition in which a product is deemed to be of interest to the user the designated data input  may correspond to for example the url for a web page metadata associated with or provided from a web page that is downloaded andor other data provided from a webpage eg key words still further the data input  is processed to detect a triggering condition detected by the trigger logic  in one embodiment the condition detected by the trigger logic  corresponds to the browser accessing the url  of i a particular domain such as a domain associated with a merchandise or commercial forum and ii the presence of a product code term or name in the url in variations the triggering condition may correspond to other domain markers in the url  the presence of a particular code or term in metadata associated with or provided from a web page or the presence of a keyword or other term provided in the content of a web page as an addition or alternative the triggering logic may respond to userinput to perform the product comparison automatically in response to a user selection input eg user selects icon appearing on screen still further the triggering condition may be satisfied by presence of multiple conditions such as the combination of the product identifier being present in the url of a particular domainwhen the triggering condition is satisfied the trigger logic  triggers product detector  resulting in the product detector  processing information provided in connection with the downloaded web page the product detector  processes the information to determine an identifier for a product that is rendered with the web page the product detector  processes information corresponding to one or more of i the characters that comprise the url ii the text or content eg images included in the webpage andor iii metadata associated with the webpage embodiments further recognize that certain ecommerce sites associate product identifiers in the url that is used to select the product for additional viewing andor purchase eg addition of product item to shopping cart andor selection of products for checkout for example the urls can include a product code that maps to a specific product identifier eg manufacturer andor model of product type of class product type or class eg highdefinition television or other markers eg manufacturer the product detector  may map the product identifier included in the url to a product identifier used by the remote source as an alternative or variation the product identifier may correspond to a keyword eg brand name or trade name or product identifier that can be recognized and processed by the remote sourcein response to the triggering condition an embodiment provides that product detector  includes logic to determine from the web page data a product identifier  the product information retrieval  uses the product identifier  to signal the remote source in order to retrieve relevant product information in one implementation the product identifier  is identified from a productspecific alphanumeric string that is integrated into the url for example an embodiment recognizes that websites such as those hosted via the domain of amazon typically included a product productspecific alphanumeric string in the url when the user selects to view a product or adds the product to its shopping cart the string may be used as a product identifier in order to retrieve supplemental contentas an alternative or addition the content provided on for example the web page or portion thereof may be analyzed for text andor metadata in order to identify product identifiers in one implementation content analysis  includes logic that locates or identifies identifiers eg text alphanumeric character strings or markers eg brand or trade name key words for a product from content provided on a webpage accordingly in response to a triggering condition the content analyzer tokenizes or otherwise parses the content  from the webpage of the site  to enable detection of product identifiers or markers in one implementation the content analysis  scans the relevant text of the webpage including characters or coding that can either identify the product or serve to locate an identifier of the product on the webpage as an example the content analysis  may execute to identify the presence of a designated character set such as “model number” “sku” or “asin” the designated character set may be specific to a domain or site and can serve as a marker for a product identifier eg typically adjacent to the character code in one implementation the content an content analysis  generates tokenized content  for product detector  content analysis  and product detector  can execute to identify markers that are indicative of the product name or identifier eg manufacturer and model number the product name or descriptor may be characterized by for example markers such as the largest font text appearing centrally at the top of the product information portion of the webpage or text that appears in the title portion of an online classified advertisement the product detector  may also execute to identify product markers such as “sku” or “asin” or “model number” such product markers can be programmatically identified from the text content of a webpage from metadata provided with a webpage or from characters included or associated with a urlaccordingly embodiments provide that the product detector  executes to extract from the webpage the product identifiers  from sources that include one or more of i url ii content provided on a webpage eg text content andor iii metadata provided with the web page the product identifiers  can be in the form of text or characters which identifies a manufacturer model number andor product class eg “d television” or “high performance laptop” alternatively the product identifiers can be in the form of a code that can map to a product identifier eg domain specific code additionally the product identifier can include identifiers such as sku asin or model number the product identifiers  are supplied to the product information retrieval component in one embodiment the product information retrieval  includes logic to communicate with a remote source the remote source can correspond to a third party service that provides enhanced product information and user generated content for products including products that correspond to the category or kind that are displayed on the webpage  in one embodiment the product information retrieval component  is configured to communicate with a service site  using for example an application program interface  provided by the service sitein one embodiment product information retrieval component  generates a product query  which specifies at least one of the product identifiers  in one implementation query  is handled by the service site interface  the service site interface  may communicate with the product information engine  in order to obtain additional product information about the particular product for example site interface  may access user generated content  such as expert reviews that specify information about the product identified by the product query  the product information engine  may further access product content  in order to generate enhanced product information  the site interface  is configured to compile the user generated content  and the product information  into a query result  that is communicated back to the plugin in one implementation query result  is handled by content integration  which includes operations to filter sort format or arrange content provided in the query result  in particular content integration  is configured to format the content to supplement existing content rendered through a browser presentation component  for example one implementation provides that the content integration  generates a popup  that displays the product information provided to the query result  as an independent panel or window to that of the existing content of the webpage  in another implementation content integration  is configured to generate a mashup  that displays the product information from the query result  in some integrated fashion with the existing content of the webpage  the mash up popup  may generated from the content integration component  utilizing portions of the webpage content rendered to the browsers presentation  for example a checkout box for a product the user has selected to purchase may include a flyover window that displays product information from the query result  the popup  andor mash up  may be integrated into the browser presentation  so that the user is able to view content from multiple sources when considering a product purchasevarious kinds of product information may be extracted and presented from the courier result  in one embodiment the site service  corresponds to a highly knowledgeable site where products are reviewed by experts described by manufacturer or expert subjected to user reviews and feedback rated provided comparative shopping or pricing results and associated with governmental information such as recalls energy conservation rankings or safety recalls the content integration component  may use any of the kinds of information provided in the query result  to supplement the webpage content  where the product is presentedin one embodiment the browser plugin  executes the trigger component  to detect a triggering condition from which processes for product detection eg content parsing url analysis takes place in one implementation the trigger  detects a triggering condition corresponding to the user selecting an item for purchase for example on an ecommerce site a user can typically perform several types of activities including searching for merchandise items viewing or researching merchandise items and selecting merchandise items for a shopping cart or purchase at some point the user may select to purchase the product by clicking on a feature where the item is added to some form of a queue such as a shopping cart the trigger logic  may operate to identify triggering conditions that correspond to for example webpages of a particular domain a product page a shopping cart andor a purchasing pagein response to detecting such a page the product detector  parses the url andor text content on the web page to determine a product identifier such as a product name product class or other product identifier eg sku model number and manufacturer the product identifier may then be used to search and retrieve supplemental content about or relevant to the product eg expert reviews independent reports about the product information about other products of the same class information about the manufacturer product comparison information or governmental information eg safety recalls environmental information the supplemental content can be provided at the same time as the content from the ecommerce site giving the user a chance to affirm or reconsider his purchase by viewing information from the remote siteas example the input trigger  may be generated in response to the user viewing a product page on an ecommerce site reviewing user comments about a product or selecting a particular category of products still further in other variations the triggering logic  may respond to input in the form of a triggering condition that corresponds to the user navigating to any predetermined ecommerce site where products can potentially be purchasedas still another variation the triggering component  may be responsive to user input for example a user may select to execute the processes provided by the browser plugin  when for example the user is viewing any given webpage containing a product for example the user may scan online classifieds for used products identify product on a particular classified ad and provide the input via the triggering component  to initiate the processes described for the browser plugin methodologyfig  illustrates a computerimplemented method for presenting product information to facilitate online transactions according to embodiments a method such as described by an embodiment of fig  may be implemented using for example components described with an embodiment of fig  accordingly reference is made to elements of fig  for purpose of illustrating a suitable element or component for performing a step or substep being described a method such as described with an embodiment of fig  may be performed on for example a user terminal eg operating a browser or application in some embodiments functionality such as described below may be provided through a programmatic resource eg browser plugin that executes on the user terminal and which originates from a source that is independent of the ecommerce site where the relevant ecommerce activity takes place eg where triggering event takes placein an embodiment a product of interest is detected from the users activity at an ecommerce site  the detection process may be performed by software or logic executing a computing device during for example users web browsing session the detection process may detect user activity that corresponds to for example one or more of the following i the user searching for a particular product at a site  ii the user performing an action such as specifying selection input for a product in order to receive additional information about that product  or iii the user selecting a product for purchase  these and other product detection activities may be further performed in response to triggering events the triggering event may correspond to the user performing a corresponding activity eg searching selecting attempting to purchase or providing triggering input to initiate the product detection processonce the product of interest is detected one or more identifiers for the product of interest are determined  various techniques may be used to determine the product identifier from the webpage data in one implementation the product identifiers are determined from analyzing the characters embedded in the url of a webpage  the url of a product page purchasing page or shopping site can be scanned or parsed for codes that are identifiers of productsin another implementation the product identifiers are identified from analyzing content  such as text content eg expert reviews usergenerated content etc in one implementation the text analysis includes scraping the content which can be analyzed for placement prominence keyword matching andor various other characteristics furthermore such text analysis can serve to determine the subject of the content eg product that is displayed on the merchandise webpage in addition to keyword identification which can match to product product type classifications etc the text analysis can be used to identify numeric or character coded identifies for product such character identifiers include for example the sku asin andor item model numberaccording to some embodiments the plugin or system performing the steps described queries a remote or external site where enhance product information is accessible in one implementation the remote or external site is operated independently of the website where the product information is provided in variations however the remote or external site include functional components that can form part of the system for providing the additional and enhance product information in one embodiment the external site includes an api for responding to queries that specify product identifiers the query that is generated may specify one or more of the product identifiers  the query may be structured or formatted to accommodate the remote site the formatting may include specifying product identifiers in a predetermined format in use by the remote site in addition the product identifier may be altered or converted with logic to specify an alternative meaningful product identifier for the remote site for example if the product identifier detected on a particular page is for a specific model and manufacturer of a product the query may specify a product class as an alternative or addition to the model number and manufacturerthe query to the remote or external site generates a query result from which information and content can be extracted and displayed  the query result may be generated in connection with content from the website that generates the webpage of the merchandise object  in one embodiment the query results includes text and or image content that includes information such as expert reviews manufacturer supplied information reseller provided information user reviews and feedback rankings from users andor experts comparative shopping or pricing analysis and results andor governmental information such as energy conservation information or safety recallsthe information of the query result can be selected based on user preference are predetermined priority scheme andor formatted resized font changed picture deletion etc then presented in connection with the webpage on which the merchandise object is provided various presentation formats can be utilized and presenting the information from the quarry result in connection with the webpage of the merchandise object a supplemental presentation may be generated in the form of an overlay  one or more concurrent panels  andor one or more separate tabs in one implementation the supplemental content is integrated in the form of a mashup with the webpage content in this form of supplemental content is presented to in a manner that is highly integrated and concurrent eg overlay with the content of the webpage furthermore the supplemental content itself may carry content from the webpage for example a flyover or overlay may include extracted portions of the content from the webpage such as image of the product as provided on the webpage as well content from the remote sourcein displaying the content from the remote source the content may be formatted and edited programmatically onthefly for display in a concurrent form eg in a mashup for example the query to the remote source may generate content that can be resized stripped of advertisement and images or extraneous information resized and edited eg portions of the content selected over other portions the result is that the content from the remote source can be displayed in a relatively small panel or portion of a webpage so as to be supplemental to the content that is existing from the ecommerce sitepresentationfig  illustrates a presentation that can be generated in accordance with one or more embodiments according to some embodiments a presentation  may be generated to include content from separate or disparate sources regarding merchandise object on a source webpage in one embodiment a webpage  is rendered onto the users browser or webbased application in response to a user navigating to for example an ecommerce site the webpage  may include product information or description  pictures  andor usergenerated content  the usergenerated content  can include for example feedback from users who purchase the product and submitted comments about the product through the site that hosts the webpageadditionally the presentation  may include commerce functionality for enabling the user to initiate a transaction to purchase the product specific examples of commerce functionality include a shopping cart  which lists items the user has selected for purchase shopping carts  often include functionality to enable the user to add or remove products as well as to increase the quantity of the items being purchased in addition to the shopping cart  the commerce functionality includes a purchasing page  which can be presented as a page that lists the product and purchase price including tax and shipping along with an interface that enables the user to enter a confirmation input to complete the transaction for purchase of the itemin one embodiment supplemental content  is generated to include product information  that originates from a remote source that is independent of the website that hosts the webpage  for example the remote source may include a service accessible from a website where enhanced product information is provided eg cnet such a remote source may supply the product information  of the supplemental content  furthermore the remote source may be operated independently of the ecommerce site for example the response from the ecommerce site may be transmitted without awareness of the functionality executing on the user terminalas an alternative or variation multiple remote or external sites may be used to aggregate and present product information in a supplemental formthe product information may include for example expert reviews manufacturer supplied information reseller provided information user reviews and feedback rankings from users andor experts comparative shopping or pricing analysis and results andor governmental information such as energy conservation information or safety recalls as a specific example the product reviews may be conducted by an expert who ranks the product eg scale of one through five and further highlights the positive and negative aspects of the product eg “the good” “the bad” and “the ugly”in one embodiment the product information  is displayed in the form of an overlay which can be at least partially transparent in variations the product information  can be provided as a flyover separate tab or other dynamic so that the product information of the supplemental content is display concurrently with the webpage and its product information such a display may alternatively
