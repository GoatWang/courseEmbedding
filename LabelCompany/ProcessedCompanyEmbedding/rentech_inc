related to the commerce city site technology maintenance and personnel are expected to be at an annualized run rate of  million by the end of  any ongoing costs would be to protect patents covering rentech’s alternative energy technologies to maintain the commerce city site if efforts to sell the site are unsuccessful or to continue lowcost efforts to seek partners who would provide funding to deploy its technologies technology accomplishments over the course of operating the pdu rentech has obtained sufficient data on its alternative energy technologies which can be used for commercial application and the company has created a portfolio of intellectual property rights to protect its technological advancements the company’s technologies include the rentechclearfuels and rentechsilvagas biomass gasification technologies as well as the rentech fischertropsch process all of which have been successfully demonstrated to produce synthetic and renewable fuels and renewable power the company has operated its fischertropsch technology successfully for more than  hours and produced certified synthetic jet and diesel fuel this month rentech concluded the ibr project at its pdu and obtained the necessary data that would support the scaleup and the deployment of the rentechclearfuels and rentech fischertropsch technologies the company operated its rentechclearfuels gasification technology at the pdu for over  hours and it operated the integrated biomasstofuels ibr project for more than  hours the rentechsilvagas biomass gasification technology was previously demonstrated at commercial scale focus on profitable growth opportunities the company’s focus on nearerterm profitable growth opportunities is a direct result of the high cost to develop new technologies relative to current energy prices and lack of government incentives and regulations supporting alternative energy particularly within the united states which have made it difficult for the company and other alternative energy companies to commercialize their technologies while rentech believes that its technologies have commercial value in the future as well as in different geographies it believes that company resources are better directed at opportunities that will produce more immediate returns as it does not expect the market opportunity for alternative energy to improve materially in the united states within the next several years as previously disclosed rentech intends to focus on new businesses that meet the following criteria unlevered aftertax returns in the midteens or higher certainty of revenue with longterm contracts for offtake providing stability of cash flows reliance upon demonstrated technologies and leverage rentech’s expertise rentech expects to make an announcement setting forth its next steps within the coming months today’s actions are the most recent in a series of steps rentech has taken to rationalize its capital structure reduce operating expenses and deliver value including a special distribution of approximately  million to shareholders in december  of which approximately  was a return of capital the redemption of

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

city co and to eliminate all related rd activities the companys strategy is focused on more immediate growth opportunities within the energy industry that do not rely on new technologieswe are grateful to our employees for their dedication and tremendous effort to successfully develop innovative and workable technologies for alternative energy production said d hunt ramsbottom president and ceo of rentech while our elimination of these positions is a difficult decision todays actions will further position rentech to drive value for shareholders by cutting rd spending and focusing on businesses that generate strong returns with ready markets and certainty of revenue the investments we are considering have either immediate or nearterm profitability and will meet our disciplined investment criteria our success in growing rentech nitrogen and generating attractive returns from that business is the best example to date of the disciplined investment approach that we will follow as we consider additional investmentsexpected cost savingsas a result of these changes rentech will eliminate  employee and contractor positions in the companys alternative energy segment during the first half of  in addition rentech will attempt to sell the pdu as well as approximately  acres of land in natchez ms it acquired for the development of an alternative energy facility rentech expects to incur a onetime noncash impairment charge to intangible assets related to its technology of approximately  million in its financial statements for the period ended december  due to the pdu closing rentech expects expenses related to its research activities and facilities and its technologies to decline from approximately  million in  to approximately  million in  which is consistent with the companys previous guidance the  expenses will be for final rd activities including completion of the us department of energy integrated biorefinery ibr project grant requirements winding down and decommissioning the pdu employee severance site maintenance insurance preservation of patents and a small group of remaining employeesapproximately  million of these  expenses are anticipated to be classified as selling general and administrative sga expenses beginning in the second quarter as the company cuts its rd activities the company has no plans to incur rd expenses in  sga expenses related to the commerce city site technology maintenance and personnel are expected to be at an annualized run rate of  million by the end of  any ongoing costs would be to protect patents covering rentechs alternative energy technologies to maintain the commerce city site if efforts to sell the site are unsuccessful or to continue lowcost efforts to seek partners who would provide funding to

application and the company has created a portfolio of intellectual property rights to protect its technological advancements the companys technologies include the rentechclearfuels and rentechsilvagas biomass gasification technologies as well as the rentech fischertropsch process all of which have been successfully demonstrated to produce synthetic and renewable fuels and renewable

gasification technology at the pdu for over  hours and it operated the integrated biomasstofuels ibr project for more than  hours the rentechsilvagas biomass gasification technology was previously demonstrated at commercial scalefocus on profitable growth opportunitiesthe companys focus on nearerterm profitable growth opportunities is a direct result of the high cost to develop new technologies relative to current energy prices and lack of government incentives and regulations supporting alternative energy particularly within the united states which have made it difficult for the company and other alternative energy companies to commercialize their technologies while rentech believes that its technologies have commercial value in the future as well as in different geographies it believes that company resources are better directed at opportunities that will produce more immediate returns as it does not expect the market opportunity for alternative energy to improve materially in the united states within the next several yearsas previously disclosed rentech intends to focus on new businesses that meet the following criteria unlevered aftertax returns in the midteens or higher certainty of revenue with longterm contracts for offtake providing stability of cash flows reliance upon demonstrated technologies and leverage rentechs expertise rentech expects to make an
