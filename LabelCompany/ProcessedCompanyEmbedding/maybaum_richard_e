defendantrespondent    argued january    decided march   before judges axelrad payne and sabatino on appeal from the superior court of new jersey law division morris county l richard e brennan argued the cause for appellant drinker biddle  reath attorneys mr brennan on the brief robert a smith argued the cause for respondent smith  doran attorneys mr smith on the brief per curiam plaintiff allied management inc appeals from a judgment in favor of defendant scott maybaum on its claim of diversion of a corporate opportunity following a bench trial during the trial it was established that allied a property management company was  owned and controlled by kenneth friedman allied and its affiliated singlepurpose companies owned and operated directly and indirectly several franchises in north jersey including bottle king liquor stores and dunkin donuts in  upon graduation from college and marriage to friedmans daughter lauren maybaum became employed by friedman and was given the title of vice president of allied maybaum performed bookkeeping and office work for allied and was provided with a company car a gas card and an american express card maybaum worked mostly out of allieds office where he had a desk next to friedmans and through  he and his fatherinlaw had a very close personal and business relationship during that time maybaums responsibilities grew and friedman eventually allowed him to operate two liquor stores and assist him in locating suitable investment and retail properties for acquisition in mid to late  maybaum and his wife began having marital problems which impacted on his business relationship with his fatherinlaw by march  the relationship had reached the point where friedman had made it clear that maybaum was no longer welcome at allied friedman told the employees and suppliers to no longer report to maybaum stripped him of all job duties severely cut his salary cancelled his company credit card changed the locks at some of the business premises disconnected his computer and assigned someone else to work at his desk in a letter dated may   maybaum recounted these facts to friedman and for all intents and purposes maybaum tendered his resignation from allied maybaums college friend jeremy isaacs was a real estate broker for schuckman realty which dealt mainly with commercial properties on long island around the time maybaum wrote his formal letter of resignation he contacted isaacs seeking retail space on long island for a potential liquor store lease the court found that maybaum met with isaacs and first viewed a petsmart building on hempstead turnpike in levittown long island new york on may   maybaum and isaacs planned to purchase the building as partners with maybaum operating a liquor store in approximately  square feet and isaacs leasing out the remaining  square feet on that date isaacs made an offer to the seller norman weinstein on behalf of himself and scott maybaum of allied management which was accepted a contract of sale was executed between weinstein and lt purchase llc the entity formed by maybaum and isaacs around october   the contract made no mention of allied and no financial documents of allied were requested or relied upon by weinstein in negotiating the deal following closing in november  isaacs placed a for lease sign in the window of the building prompting a leasepurchase offer for the entire premises to be made by the adjacent ford dealership which the partnership accepted thus the partnership was able to flip the property and maybaum and isaacs each received a profit of  cash and  a month in rental payments friedman became aware of maybaums financial gain from the long island property in connection with laurens divorce action friedman filed this action asserting that as vicepresident of allied maybaum had diverted a business opportunity to which it was entitled and sought as damages the profits maybaum had received from the sale of the long island property following trial the court articulated its findings of fact and credibility assessments analyzed in the context of the corporate opportunity doctrine set forth in valle v north jersey auto club  nj super  app div  valle requires a plaintiff to prove each of the following elements  that there is presented to a corporate officer a business opportunity  that the corporation is financially able to undertake that opportunity  that the opportunity is by its nature in the line of the corporations business and is of practical advantage to it  that the opportunity is one in which the corporation has an interest or a reasonable expectancy and  that by embracing the opportunity the selfinterests of the officer will be brought into conflict with the interests of the corporation id at  having found plaintiff satisfied only the second element ie financial ability to avail itself of the opportunity the court concluded that maybaum did not breach a fiduciary duty to allied accordingly the court entered judgment on maybaums behalf on appeal plaintiff contends the trial court committed reversible error in erroneously overreading the requirements that a plaintiff must establish in a corporate opportunity case more particularly plaintiff claims the trial court erred by  finding maybaum was not a corporate officer of allied  holding the diverted opportunity must be essential to the complaining corporations business and  accepting isaacs explanation that his reference to maybaum as being of allied management was a clerical error and concluding it was not important to weinstein in the sale of the long island property plaintiff further contends the trial court erred in concluding that maybaum had the right to do what he did to further his own career path we are satisfied there is ample support in the record for the trial courts factual findings and credibility assessments and we discern no misapplication of the law warranting reversal of the judgment rova farms resort inc v investors ins co  nj    an appellate court should not second guess the factual findings and legal conclusions of the trial judge unless they are so manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with the competent relevant and reasonably credible evidence so as to offend the interests of justice we affirm substantially for the reasons articulated by judge deanne wilson on the record following the bench trial we add the following comments as to the first prong of the corporate usurpation doctrine although maybaum was given the title of vicepresident by his fatherinlaw the court analogized his position in the banking context to a manager of the tellers the court found that maybaum had virtually no decisionmaking capacity as friedman admittedly reserved all important management decisions of allied for himself and maybaums job responsibilities were more in the nature of an employee than of a corporate officer even if maybaum had some degree of corporate responsibility during his tenure at allied by may   the date the court found maybaum and isaacs first looked at the long island property maybaum was not functioning as a vicepresident of allied or in any other capacity recognized by that company maybaum may have retained his corporate title as a formality and received a nominal salary from allied through may   but he had no authority within the allied organization as a practical matter by the time of his resignation maybaum was not even viewed as an employee of allied he had no daytoday responsibilities and did not even have an office to report to or a desk from which he could work this finding is not inconsistent with the offer for the long island property being conveyed to weinstein on behalf of isaacs and scott maybaum of allied management isaacs explained how he had inadvertently linked the names maybaum and allied in the offer document according to isaacs several years prior his assistant had inputted one of maybaums business cards into isaacs rolodex computer program when isaacs asked his assistant to generate a letter to weinstein offering to purchase the property on behalf of maybaum and himself the information from maybaums business card automatically came up and was inserted in the letter isaacs testified it was a mistake he knew maybaum was no longer with allied and he had no intention whatsoever of misleading anyone the court credited isaacs explanation noting it was familiar with the rolodex program and concluded that the initial reference to allied in the offer was not done in bad faith the court then analyzed weinsteins testimony and concluded that although the seller may have initially placed some reliance upon the use of allieds name its creditworthiness played no role in the ultimate sale weinstein conducted no investigation of allied other than to find out it was a familyowned business with a number of locations in new jersey and used the bottle king name the court further noted that the october l contract made no mention of allied weinstein had no conversations with anyone from allied and there were no financial documents of allied submitted or requested by weinstein moreover more than a month before the closing weinstein had the application to assume the existing mortgage which had been signed by maybaum and isaacs on behalf of their partnership and knew allied was not involved in the financing or the purchase of the property maybaum and isaacs testified they each had to come up with  in cash and each borrow  to fulfill their obligations to purchase the property this record clearly supports the courts conclusion that maybaum did not use the good name and creditworthiness of allied in order to secure an advantage in the long island purchase transaction nor did he exploit a corporate opportunity by utilization of any of allieds funds as to the third prong the court found that a liquor store in the state of new york was simply not by its nature in the line of allieds business it was undisputed that all of the enterprises managed or operated by allied and its affiliates were located in northern new jersey and allied had no established practice of investing outside of this state although friedman had made some preliminary inquiries in westchester as of l allied had never purchased property in new york and had no businesses or employees there nor did it have any liquor licenses or own operate or manage any liquor establishments in new york in fact allieds total absence from the state of new york was a primary reason maybaum decided to look to long island for a business opportunity upon the breakup of his marriage and the termination of his relationship with friedman and allied accordingly the business venture that maybaum and isaacs sought to pursue in long island was not within the established geographic scope of allieds business in connection with this prong the trial judge merely noted in passing as something that courts consider that the opportunity offered to maybaum to own a commercial piece of property and operate a liquor store in long island was not essential to the running of allieds business both parties discuss at length whether a business opportunity must be essential to qualify under the usurpation doctrine we need not address this issue however as it was not pertinent to the courts determination because the long island opportunity was so outside of the mainstream of allieds business that no liability could attach regardless of whether essentiality was required as a matter of law   affirmed in litigation before judge zuckerzarett maybaum sued allied for compensation from may l through may l and was awarded  though the order states to may l all parties agree this was a
