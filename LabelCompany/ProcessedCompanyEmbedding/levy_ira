retirement income use discretion in determining if retirement income should be levied for more information on prelevy consideration see irm prelevy considerations see irm  delegation order  rev which outlines the authority to levy on property in the hands of a third party not to include levy form b levy a notice of levy is continuous for wages and salary other levies only reach property a third party is holding when the levy is received reminder references to property include rights to property as long as the taxpayer has a fixed and determinable right to property a levy attaches that right therefore a levy on retirement income can reach payments in the future whether or not the taxpayer has begun receiving payments when the levy is served this often means that a levy on retirement income reaches future payments because this type of levy may begin attaching payments long after the levy is served followup when the taxpayer is expected to become eligible to receive payments also see irm  systemic monitoring of continuous levy payments regarding input of transaction code tc  action code ac  and irm  fplp and paper levy form aw for discussion regarding the federal payment levy program fplp and paper levies consider setting a mandatory followup for bal due accounts reported currently not collectible if the taxpayer has the right to receive future payment but has not opted to do so the levy attaches that right a levy served while the taxpayer is receiving periodic payments reaches payments due then as well as payments as they become due later as long as there is already a fixed and determinable right to the future payments a levy on a fixed and determinable right to receive future payment eg retirement or pension income social security benefits made within the statutory period for collection remains enforceable to the extent of the value of the property levied even if the property itself is not turned over within the statutory period for collection in other words a levy prior to the expiration of the statutory period for collection on a fixed and determinable right to receive future payment is still enforceable after the expiration of the statutory

if this happens ssa will notify the office that issued the levy not to expect more payments however ssa is not allowed to explain why because privacy laws restrict to whom ssa can disclose benefit information example the taxpayer may get full benefits when the levy is served later the person starts working this may reduce the benefits to less than the exempt amount so there will be no levy proceeds if the person stops working and gets full benefits again ssa will not automatically start sending levy payments a new levy must be served note rsdi or oasdi payments are alternatively levied

employer and selfsponsored retirement vehicles that are not exempt from levy these plans include for example qualified pension profit sharing and stock bonus plans under erisa iras retirement plans for the selfemployed such as sepiras and keogh plans because these retirement vehicles provide for the taxpayers future welfare levy on the assets in a retirement account as contrasted with income from the account only after following the procedures set forth below if the taxpayer provides a written request to the service to levy the assets in the retirement account we should consider the taxpayers request to levy the account as part of the ability to pay determination prior to levying pursuant to the taxpayer’s request follow step  as described in paragraph  consider alternatives to levy on retirement assets and step  as described in paragraph  determine whether the taxpayer needs the retirement assets for necessary living expenses document the case history and levy approval memo that the taxpayer requested the irs to issue the levy do not make the flagrant conduct determination in step  as described in paragraphs  and  below follow guidance in irm retirement or profit sharing plans note if the taxpayer requests the levy and you decide that the service should levy after following steps  and  in paragraphs  and  respectively before issuing the levy verify that the taxpayer has received cdp rights if the taxpayer has not received cdp rights then follow the procedures in irm  satisfying the notice requirements note an imminent collection statute expiration date csed alone does not justify levying on retirement assets levying on assets in retirement accounts requires application of the procedures set forth below the first step in deciding whether to levy on a retirement account is to determine what property retirement assets and nonretirement assets is available to collect the liability if there is property other than retirement assets that can be used to collect the liability or if a payment agreement can be reached consider these alternatives before issuing a levy on retirement accounts also consider the expense of pursuing other assets as well as the amount to be collected levy determinations are made on a casebycase basis and revenue officers must exercise good judgment in making the determination to levy see irm  prelevy considerations document the case history with the determinations made in steps  through  below additionally levying on assets in retirement accounts requires application of the following procedures the second step in deciding whether to levy on a retirement account is to determine whether the taxpayers conduct has been flagrant if the taxpayer has not engaged in flagrant conduct do not levy on retirement accounts deciding whether the taxpayer has engaged in flagrant conduct must be done on a casebycase basis keep in mind however extenuating circumstances may exist that mitigate the taxpayers flagrant conduct see irm b example extenuating circumstances are at times situations beyond the control of taxpayers examples of extenuating circumstances to consider include illness loss of employment a personal loss family or loved one identity theftreturn preparer misconductembezzlement or natural acts of nature etc the following are some examples of flagrant conduct example a taxpayers whose failure to pay is based on frivolous arguments which are listed in notice – irb – cb  or subsequent updates see irb – at httpwwwirsgovirbirbarhtml example b taxpayers who voluntarily contributed to retirement accounts during the time period the taxpayer knew unpaid taxes were accruing see irm  retirement or profit sharing plans caution when the taxpayer verifies they have been automatically enrolled to have a limited percentage of their basic pay deducted and deposited into a retirement account do not consider this flagrant conduct example c taxpayers who continue to make voluntary contributions to retirement accounts while asserting an inability to pay an amount that is owed while irs determined voluntary contributions not necessary living expenses and disallowed them for the purpose of determining taxpayers’ ability to pay see irm  retirement or profit sharing plans caution where a tax liability has been discharged in bankruptcy the irs may continue to have a valid tax lien on certain retirement assets that existed prior to the bankruptcy see irm  voluntary contributions made to such retirement assets after the bankruptcy petition was filed are not considered flagrant caution when the taxpayer verifies they have been automatically enrolled to have a limited percentage of their basic pay deducted and deposited into a retirement account do not consider this flagrant conduct example d taxpayers convicted of tax evasion for the tax debt example e taxpayers assessed with a fraud penalty for the tax debt example f taxpayers assisting others in evading tax example g taxpayers with liabilities based on illegal income example h taxpayers who are in business pyramiding unpaid trust fund taxes and fail to provide a complete cis does not comply with the results of the services financial analysis or fail to timely make ftds example i individual taxpayers who are accumulating unpaid income taxes over multiple tax periods and will not adjust their withholding or make timely and adequate estimated tax payments to prevent future delinquencies see irm e example j trust fund recovery penalty modules has been assessed at different times or against more than one business entity example k taxpayers who have demonstrated a pattern of uncooperative or unresponsive behavior that delays the collection of the tax due eg failing to meet established deadlines failing to attend scheduled appointments documented broken promises to pay failing to respond to irs employee’s attempts to contact in such cases determining alternatives and the taxpayers dependence on the money in the retirement accounts final step may not be possible so a levy may need to be served without making those determinations example l taxpayers who have placed other assets beyond the reach of the government eg sending them outside the country concealing them dissipating them or transferring them to other people example m taxpayers with jeopardy or termination assessments subject to collection the final step in deciding whether to levy on retirement assets is to determine whether the taxpayer depends on the money in the retirement account or will in the near future for necessary living expenses if the taxpayer is dependent on the funds in the retirement account or will be in the near future do not levy the retirement account in determining whether the taxpayer depends on the money or will in the near future use the standards in irm  financial analysis to establish necessary living expenses use the life expectancy tables in pub b distribution from individual retirement arrangements iras to estimate how much can be withdrawn annually to deplete the retirement account in the taxpayers remaining life also consider any special circumstances in the taxpayers specific situation such as extraordinary expenses or additional sources of income that will be available to pay expenses during retirement the taxpayer may be able to withdraw money in a lump sum from a retirement plan if the taxpayer is eligible to receive such a withdrawal then a levy can reach that right however remember that a levy only reaches the taxpayers present rights under the plan this means that a current levy can reach a taxpayer’s vested present rights under a plan but a levy does not accelerate payment and it is only enforceable when the taxpayer is eligible to receive the benefits the terms of the plan may need to be reviewed to determine a taxpayer’s present rights example the taxpayer is fully vested in his retirement plan account balance of  pursuant to the terms of the plan the taxpayer is not yet in payout status or entitled to a lump sum withdrawal until a future date a levy may attach to the taxpayer’s present right to the  but no money can be collected until the taxpayer has a right to withdraw those funds at the future date at such future date the taxpayer’s account may have grown to  without a new levy however only  can be collected because this was the taxpayer’s present right at the time of levy example the taxpayer has an accrued benefit in a retirement plan but the terms of the plan do not allow for any lump sum withdrawal the plan provides a right in the future to receive monthly payments but the taxpayer has not yet participated in the plan long enough to qualify for any future payments that is the taxpayer is currently  vested in the accrued benefit derived from employer contributions the taxpayer has no present property rights in the employer derived accrued benefit to which a notice of levy can attach a notice of levy may attach to any contributions made by the taxpayer as the taxpayer is always  vested in those contributions but collection will depend on whether the taxpayer has a right under the terms of the plan to withdraw those funds the notice of levy form says it does not attach money in pension or retirement plans when levying on these funds sign the notice of levy in the block to the left of total amount due  have the sbse director collection area approve the notice of levy by signing the form as the service representative or see irm  managerial approval for methods to secure managerial approval consider discussing the case with the employee plans group before issuing the levy their advice as well as advice from ai  advisory and associate area counsel may be needed to determine the present right to property often a levy is served before the taxpayers precise rights are determined try to get a copy of the plan instruments as soon as possible to determine the taxpayers interests in the plan when available review a copy of the plan prior to issuing the levy to identify the correct custodian unless any documents or other pieces of evidence reflect that pension or retirement account has more than one custodian no additional parties beyond the pension or retirement custodian need be served with the levy when money is withdrawn from a retirement account the taxpayer may be liable for income tax on the withdrawal if the taxpayer is less than  years old a  percent additional tax on early distributions may be assessed however the taxpayer is not liable for the  percent additional tax on early distributions if the money was withdrawn because of a notice of levy served on the retirement account see irc ta vii there may however still be income tax owed for the amount withdrawn send letter  do with the notice of levy and letter  do with the taxpayers copy of the notice of levy these letters state the withdrawal is not subject to the  percent additional tax on early distributions even if the taxpayer is under  years old these letters are available as templates on the integrated collection system retirement accounts that are exempted from the bankruptcy estate are still subject to being levied to collect taxes that are discharged in bankruptcy where a notice of federal tax lien was filed before bankruptcy for retirement accounts that are excluded from the bankruptcy estate the service may still levy on those accounts to collect taxes that are discharged in bankruptcy even when no notice of federal tax lien has been filed it is only necessary that the discharged taxes were assessed that notice and demand was given and that the statutory lien arose before the bankruptcy was filed consider a levy on the retirement accounts if there is no other property that survived the bankruptcy see irm  exempt abandoned or excluded property eaep and irm  collection from exempt abandoned or excluded property eaep for guidance in determining whether collection action should be taken note in this situation the federal tax lien attaches to only the taxpayerdebtors property or rights to property held as of the bankruptcy petition date however the lien is not limited to the value of the property as of the petition date its attachment relates to any appreciation or diminution of such assets the federal tax lien does not attach to retirement account contributions made on or after the bankruptcy petition date care must be taken to limit collection to only the bankruptcy prepetition account value consult with aiinsolvency or counsel prior to issuing levies on exempted or excluded retirement accounts for assistance in determining the account value the levy attaches note retirement accounts that are exempt from the bankruptcy estate are

taxpayers wages or salary is being levied although a levy on a nonliable spouses wages or salary is not continuous the exempt amount can still be claimed however because the levy might attach only part of the nonliable spouses income the portion that is not attached can be treated like an income source that is not being levied when the exempt amount is figured see irm  taxpayers with more than one source of income example a nonliable spouses weekly take home pay is  assume this person is in a state where a levy attaches half of a nonliable spouses wages and this is the only source of income that is levied this means  is not attached by the levy if this levy is served in  and the person is filing jointly with two exemptions  is exempt from levy since the exempt amount is less than the amount that is not levied no exempt amount is subtracted from the  that the levy attaches the employer should send a weekly check of  the  exempt amount has been accounted for by the other  that is not attached example take the same facts as the prior example but the person claims four exemptions so the weekly exempt amount is  because this is more than the  that is not attached the person needs to be allowed an additional exempt amount from the  that is attached this is figured      exempt from levy     − not attached by the levy       additional exempt amount to be allowed the employer then figures      attached by the levy     −  additional exempt amount      weekly levy proceeds as a practical matter in this example a simpler explanation may be to tell the employer to send half of the persons take home pay if the exempt amount is less than half of that but follow the instructions on the levy form if the exempt amount is more than half of the take home pay this will lead to the same amount of levy proceeds      take home pay    − exempt amount      weekly levy proceeds   notice to the nonliable spouse when a taxpayers community property interest in a nonliable spouses property or

merchant accounts a merchant account is a contract between a merchant and a bank or processor the merchant account contract allows the bank or processor to process andor receive cardbased payments credit or debit payment for goods andor services on the merchant’s behalf this contract allows the merchant to accept card based payments in this situation the parties are as follows the merchant is the taxpayer a merchant service provider is the organization responsible for directly maintaining the relationship with the merchant taxpayer the merchant service provider is normally an independent sales organization or merchant service provider isomsp few banks are currently isomsps example a taxpayer owns a restaurant and wants to accept customer credit or debit card payments the taxpayer enters into a contract with an isomsp to process cardbased payments the isomsp provides a merchant account for the taxpayer to account for the funds received at the end of the payment process an acquiring bank also known as an acquirer is the bank or processor that acquires the funds received on behalf of the merchant taxpayer at the end of the cardbased payment process the issuing bank is the bank of the cardholder customer that purchases goods or service from the merchant taxpayer per the terms of the merchant account contract the acquiring bank or processor exchanges funds with issuing banks on behalf of the merchant taxpayer and pays the merchant for the net balance of their daily payment card activity gross sales minus reversals interchange fees and acquiring bank or processor fees the acquiring bank or processor normally transfers a batch of payments to the merchant taxpayer daily note some debit card transactions are settled directly to the merchants taxpayers operating bank account normally checking account nearly instantaneously and therefore are not transferred with the daily batch the isomsp sells the merchant taxpayer the service of processing the credit card payments from the point of sale to the funds transfer to the acquiring bank the point of sale pos is when the cardholder customer purchases a good or service from the merchant taxpayer the service sold to the merchant usually includes the equipment used at the pos the service of a processor and the merchant account contract note although card payment processing methods vary by industry typically taxpayers get their cardbased payment processing services from an isomsp few banks actually sell processing or function as processors a bank business customer who wants to take creditdebit cards is usually sent to the bank’s subsidiary corporation which processes credit card transactions or an isomsp who works with the bank a card network or interchange is the network that acts as an intermediary between an acquiring bank and an issuing bank visa and mastercard are card networks the process of authorization capture and transfer of cardbased payments goes through a card network or interchange a processor provides the service of processing the cardbased payments through the card network the processor may be the isomsp acquiring bank or a financial institution that specializes in cardpayment processing regardless of the nature of the processor the merchant account contract is between the merchant taxpayer and the acquiring bank or processor example for visamastercard the merchant taxpayer may establish a merchant account contract directly with an isomsp or a processor to accomplish the cardpayment processing however for the visamastercard network the acquiring bank must be a bank or a processor owned by a bank the acquiring bank or processor provides the merchant taxpayer with a monthly merchant account statement the merchant account statement is similar to a bank statement and tells the merchant taxpayer about daily credit card transactions fees paid and money amounts transferred to the merchants taxpayer’s bank account   determining the location of the merchant account to determine the location of the merchant account contract determine the acquiring bank or processor that holds the merchant account contract during initial contact determine if the taxpayer accepts card payments if the taxpayer accepts card payments then secure the name and address of the merchant service provider merchant account number this is not a routing transaction number rtn the name and address of the acquiring bank bank or processor that holds the merchant account contract copy of the merchant agreement a copy of three months of merchant account statements in the event of a nonresponsive taxpayer secure the information through the taxpayer’s bank holding the operating bank account normally a checking account the acquiring bank’s rtn and the merchant account number may appear on the taxpayer’s operating bank account statements if unable to otherwise secure it secure the merchant account number by a summons to the processor or acquiring bank specifically requesting the merchant account number   property the merchant account levy attaches irc b provides that a levy shall extend only to property possessed or obligations existing at the time of the levy under the terms of a merchant account the acquiring bank or processor is obligated to pay the taxpayer for all credit card sales made this obligation arises at the time of the sale not when the funds are later forwarded to the acquiring bank based upon the manner in which the processor or acquiring bank processes cardbased payment sales the acquiring bank or processor may have difficulty determining exactly which processing fees will be paid during the cardbased payment process at the moment the levy is issued the acquiring bank or processor cannot use this fact to refuse to honor the service’s levy since the acquiring bank or processor does not make payments to the taxpayer instantaneously the acquiring bank or processor clearly owes the taxpayer funds at least daily the funds held by the processors and acquiring bank are not deposits within the meaning of irc c and the  day holding period does not apply to these funds therefore the credit card processor makes the payment when they otherwise make payments according to the merchant contract example the taxpayers restaurant runs batches and transmits their credit card receipts daily with their processor according to the merchant account contract the processor agrees to deposit the funds into the restaurants bank account three days after the credit card receipts are run when complying with a notice of levy the processor would remit the funds to the irs three days after the receipt of the notice of levy according to the merchant account contract the levy funds remitted will not include the restaurant’s receipts after the day the levy was served   issuing a merchant account levy serve levies on the acquiring bank or processor holding the merchant account contract the contract for some processors provides that processor will process the transaction and transmit to the issuing bank notification that the amount due should be sent to the acquiring bank for this type of contract the processor will

only valid to the extent that it has parted with money or moneys worth the processor may hold a superpriority under irc b the super priority may not apply to all processors as irc b only applies to a bank or similar institutions additionally the processor bank must have parted with money or moneys worth as of the date that the processor bank is served with the levy and learns of the federal tax lien see irm  bank account if the service levy has priority over the funds in the charge back account the processing company will not have to turn over those funds to the service until the time period specified in the merchant agreement has expired the service does not have the right to unilaterally cancel the merchant agreement and force the funds in the charge back account to be paid over

may leave patients at risk if there is no other facility in the area these facilities are generally referred to as skilled nursing facilities snfs in the medicare program and as nursing facilities nfs in the medicaid program because these types of cases involve patient welfare the determination to levy should consider whether the ltc facility is noncompliant uncooperative pyramiding and unable to pay discuss the potential sensitive case issues with the manager when enforcement may be necessary and document the case with alternative methods of collection considered prior to levy document this discussion and managers concurrence with plan of action in the ics history many ltc facilities receive medicare medicaid or other governmentfunded subsidies through the state health services agency levy of the primary income source may have an adverse financial impact compelling the owners to close the business levies may leave patients at risk if there is no other facility in the area to determine if alternate facilities are available notify the appropriate state agency in advance of potential enforcement action when contacting the state prior to levy guard against disclosure violations and only share general information about the levy process regardless if a notice of federal tax lien has been filed ask the contact if there are other facilities in the area to relocate the patients note generally each state has a patient relocation plan in effect if a care facility closes the irs is not responsible for relocating the patients in many cases the state will assist with patient relocation furthermore section  of the “patient protection and affordable care act” under section i h mandates specific procedures in the event of a snf or nf closure these procedures help protect the resident the resident’s family and visitors because they require the facility administrator to provide an organized plan to the state that allows the resident to make the necessary adjustments within a reasonable time frame the plan must be submitted and approved by the state agency at least  days prior to the impending closure an additional source for ltc facilities can be found on cms web page titled nursing home compare that has detailed information about every medicare and medicaidcertified nursing home in the country the web page address is

and government funding review of ltc bank deposit items will help determine the identity of any residents for whom rent is paid by a family member directly to the snf operator entity a levy may be issued to those family members to attach those funds which are generally due on a monthly basis follow the procedure in irm  when determining whether to issue a levy to a family member because most patients who require ltc become insolvent at some point due to the cost most occupy medicaid authorized beds the snf operator is reimbursed on a per diem basis from the medicaid program for care of the patient in each medicaid authorized bed that is occupied on a particular day these per diem funds are the primary source of income for most snfs in order to levy effectively and capture all of the funds being paid by medicaid to the operator levies need to be sent daily it is highly recommended that arrangements be made in advance to fax the levies directly to the accounts payable department for your state’s administering agency and to confirm receipt on the same day the snf operator bills medicare for any medical services provided whether for doctors on staff rehab services medication or other type of medical service provided to the patient claims for these services are paid by medicare administrative contractors referred to as macs once a claim has been approved for payment there is a minimum  day aging period during which the funds must be held by cms before the payment can be released to the medical provider  days for claims submitted electronically and  days for claims submitted via paper in order to capture all payments aging in the system andor due to be released at any given time to medical provider a new levy should be issued to the appropriate mac every  days the cms maintains a web page that contains locations for macs jurisdictions their definitions and who holds the contract currently the web page address is
