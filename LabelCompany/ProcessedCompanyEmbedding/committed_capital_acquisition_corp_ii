total      all the proceeds from this offering will be held in trust and all the offering expenses have been or will be funded from loans made to us by bcm bcm has agreed to make loans to us from time to time as these expenses are incurred these loans will be repaid upon the consummation of our initial business transaction all these loans will be due and payable upon the completion of our initial business transaction and will be on terms that waive any and all rights to the funds in the trust account  after this offering and prior to our initial business transaction all expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target business negotiating an acquisition agreement and consummating such acquisition and our other working capital requirements will be funded by loans provided to us from bcm and interest earned on the funds in the trust account bcm has agreed to loan us funds from time to time of up to  all of these loans will be due and payable upon the completion of our initial business transaction and will be on terms that waive any and all rights to the funds in the trust account we anticipate that approximately  including taxes owed on such interest income will be available to us from interest income to be earned on the funds held in the trust account the estimated interest earned on funds held in the trust account is based on what believe to be a conservative interest rate of  per annum following this offering generated from the funds in the trust account during the six month period ended january   us treasury bills with six month maturities were yielding approximately  per annum the  assumed interest rate has been applied for the purpose of the above calculation because we believe it represents a conservative estimate calculated based on the above described yields while we cannot assure you the balance of the trust account will be invested to yield these rates we believe such rates are representative of those we may receive on the balance of the trust account for purposes of presentation the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately following the offering the amounts set forth above are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses all the proceeds from this offering of  or  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full will be deposited into the trust account at jp morgan chase bank na maintained by continental stock transfer  trust company as trustee all of the expenses associated with this offering estimated at  have been or will be funded to us by bcm through noninterest bearing loans following the consummation of this offering and prior to the consummation of our initial business transaction in order to fund all expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target business negotiating an acquisition agreement and consummating such acquisition and our other working capital requirements bcm has agreed to loan us funds from time to time of up to  all these loans will be due and payable upon the completion of our initial business transaction and will be on terms that waive any and all rights to the funds in the trust account none of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account other than any interest earned on the funds in the trust account that we need to pay our income or other tax obligations any remaining interest that we need for our working capital requirements until the earlier of i the consummation of a business transaction ii our redemption of the public shares sold in this offering if we are unable to consummate a business transaction within  months from the date of effectiveness of the registration statement or iii our liquidation if no redemption occurs the proceeds held in the trust account net of taxes and amounts released to us for working capital purposes may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business transaction or if there are insufficient funds to pay other expenses relating to such transaction such as reimbursement to insiders for outofpocket expenses third party due diligence expenses or potential finders’ fees in each case only upon the consummation of a business transaction in the event there are funds remaining in the trust account after satisfaction of all of such obligations such funds may be used to finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions as determined by our board of directors at that time all amounts held in the trust account will be released to us on the closing of our initial business transaction we intend to use proceeds from loans provided to us from bcm and interest earned on the funds in the trust account which we are permitted to withdraw for working capital purposes for due diligence legal accounting fees and expenses of the acquisition including investment banking fees and other expenses including structuring and negotiating a business transaction as well as a possible down payment reverse break up fees a provision which requires a payment to the target company if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained lockup or “noshop” provision a provision designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses if necessary while we do not have any current intention to use these funds as a down payment or to fund a “noshop” provision with respect to a particular proposed business transaction if we were to enter into such an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “noshop” provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business transaction and the amount of our available funds at the time in addition to the use of funds described above we could also use a portion of these funds to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business we may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in connection with a business transaction either because the consideration for our business transaction is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or the issuance of our debt securities in such event the proceeds not expended will be used to finance our operations which may include the target businesses that we acquire in our business transaction to effect other acquisitions or for expenses as determined by our board of directors at that time we may use these funds among other things for director and officer compensation changeincontrol payments or payments to affiliates to finance the operations of the target business to make other acquisitions and to pursue our growth strategy to the extent that our capital stock or the issuance of our debt securities are used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business transaction or in the event that indebtedness from third parties is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business transaction the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business transaction will be disbursed to the combined company and will along with any other interest earned on the funds held in the trust account not expended be used to finance our operations in the event that third party indebtedness is used as consideration our officers and directors will not be personally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness on february   and march   we entered into loan payable agreements for approximately  each with bcm the loans are payable upon the consummation of our initial business transaction bear no interest and contain a waiver of any and all rights to the funds in the trust account resulting from the consummation of this offering accordingly the loans will become worthless and will not be repaid unless and until the consummation of our initial business transaction in addition we expect to enter into further loans with bcm to fund our expenses described in this prospectus all of the expenses associated with this offering estimated at  have been or will be funded to us by bcm through noninterest bearing loans following the consummation of this offering and prior to the consummation of our initial business transaction in order to fund all expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target business negotiating an acquisition agreement and consummating such acquisition and our other working capital requirements bcm has agreed to loan us funds of up to  all these loans will be due and payable upon the completion of our initial business transaction and will be on terms that waive any and all rights to the funds in the trust account the proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trust account agent only in us “government securities” within the meaning of section a of the investment company act with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a of the investment company act by restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the investment company act in no event will any of our initial stockholders officers or directors or any of our or their respective affiliates be paid any finder’s fee consulting fee or any other form of compensation prior to or for any services they render in connection with the consummation of a business transaction however upon the closing of our initial business transaction our board of directors will have the sole discretion to determine the number of initial shares to be forfeit by each of our initial stockholders based on the degree of participation of our initial stockholders in activities relating to the initial business transaction as a result certain of our initial stockholders may forfeit a lesser number of their initial shares than other initial stockholders if our board of directors determines that such individuals played a more prominent role in identifying evaluating and closing a business transaction however our initial stockholders officers or directors will receive reimbursement subject to board approval for any outofpocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business transactions reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of related party loans and interest earned on the trust account and currently allocated in the above table to “legal and accounting expenses attendant to the due diligence investigations structuring and negotiations of a business transaction” “due diligence excluding accounting and legal due diligence of prospective targets” “legal and accounting fees relating to sec reporting obligations” and “other miscellaneous expenses” there is no limit on the amount of outofpocket expenses reimbursable by us except that reimbursement may not be made using funds in the trust account unless and until a business transaction is consummated since the role of present management after a business transaction is uncertain we have no ability to determine what remuneration if any will be paid to those persons after a business transaction our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i our redemption of our public shares for a per share pro rata portion of the trust account including interest but net of any taxes amounts released to us for working capital purposes subject to applicable law or ii our liquidation if redemption does not occur in no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business transaction we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business transactions directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business transaction company description we are a blank check company formed for the purpose of acquiring through a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet identified to date we have not conducted any active operations since inception we have not conducted any search activities and we do not have any specific initial business transaction under consideration or discussion as of the date of this prospectus furthermore we do not intend to commence any activities relating to our initial business transaction until committed capital acquisition corporation a company affiliated with our officers and directors and certain of our initial stockholders completes its initial business transaction or alternatively until committed capital acquisition corporation is liquidated or its public shares are redeemed except as discussed below we are not limited to a particular industry geographic region or minimum transaction value for purposes of consummating our initial business transaction although we intend to initially focus on operating businesses within the united states having a fair market value less than  at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business transaction simultaneous with our formation our initial stockholders formed ccac a blank check company that will initially focus on operating businesses within the united states having a fair market value greater than  at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with its initial business transaction it is anticipated that the initial public offering of ccac will coincide with this offering and our officers and directors will be the officers and directors of ccac until ccac signs a definitive agreement in respect of its initial business transaction we will only seek a target business that has a fair market value less than  at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business transaction however even during such time period we will be able to pursue an initial business transaction with a target company having a fair market value greater than  if such transaction is rejected by the board of directors of ccac furthermore although it is not our intent we are not prohibited from partnering with ccac to submit a joint bid for an initial business transaction we will seek to capitalize on more than  years of combined transaction and investing experience of our management team michael rapp our cofounder chief executive officer and chairman and philip wagenheim our cofounder president secretary and director our management team has been involved in more than  transactions ranging from financing activities to advisory engagements including experience in managing committed capital acquisition corporation in addition messrs rapp and wagenheim are the founders of bcm a boutique investment bank and brokerdealer which has arranged financings provided advisory services for invested in and has held interests in a diverse portfolio of highgrowth companies bcm has led numerous initial public offerings and private placements and has also specialized in providing its clients solutions with regard to accessing the capital markets through nontraditional methods such as spacs and reverse mergers prior to forming bcm messrs rapp and wagenheim were managing directors and founders of oscar gruss  son incorporateds private client group our initial stockholders also include pp  llc michael serruya silkroad equity llc delavaco capital inc and committed capital holdings ii llc as of the date of this prospectus i each of pp  llc michael serruya silk road equity llc and delavaco capital inc will beneficially own  initial shares and ii committed capital holdings ii llc will own  initial shares all such initial shares will be subject to forfeiture as described in this prospectus these initial stockholders do not have a contractual or fiduciary obligation to assist in the identification of potential candidates for our initial business transaction or present business opportunities to us mr rapp is the managing member of committed capital holdings ii llc while we intend to utilize the criteria listed below in evaluating business transaction opportunities we expect that no individual criterion will entirely determine a decision to pursue a particular opportunity further any particular business transaction opportunity which we ultimately determine to pursue may not meet one or more of these criteria  fair market value of less than  million we intend to initially focus on target businesses that have a fair market value less than  at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business transaction  domestic us business we will seek to acquire a business that is focused primarily on doing business in and is headquartered in the united states however we will consider acquiring businesses domiciled overseas or with significant operations overseas if those businesses meet a significant portion of our other investment criteria  established companies with proven track records we will seek to acquire established companies with sound historical financial performance we intend to focus our search for acquisition targets on companies with a history of strong operating and financial results we do not intend to acquire startup companies with a limited history of operations  companies with strong free cash flow characteristics we will seek to acquire companies that have a history of strong stable free cash flow generation ie companies that typically generate cash in excess of that required to maintain or expand the business’s asset base  strong industry position we will seek to acquire businesses that operate within industries that have strong fundamentals the factors we will consider include growth prospects competitive dynamics level of consolidation need for capital investment and barriers to entry  competitive barriers we will seek to acquire businesses that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors which may help to protect their market position and profitability and deliver strong free cash flow factors that we will consider include the strengths and weaknesses of target businesses relative to their competitors with regard to product quality customer loyalty cost impediments associated with customers switching to competitors patent protection and brand positioning  experienced management team we will seek to acquire businesses that have strong experienced management teams we will focus on management teams with a proven track record of driving revenue growth enhancing profitability and generating strong free cash flow we believe that the operating expertise of our officers and directors will complement not replace the target’s management team  diversified customer and supplier base we will seek to acquire businesses that have a diversified customer and supplier base companies with a diversified customer and supplier base are generally better able to endure economic downturns industry consolidation changing business preferences and other factors that may negatively impact their customers suppliers and competitors these criteria are not intended to be exhaustive any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business transaction may be based to the extent relevant on these general guidelines as well as other considerations factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant  our executive offices are located at  fifth avenue nd floor new york ny  and our telephone number at that location is   full

significantly longer there is a nominal cost associated with the abovereferenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the dwac system the transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker  and the broker would determine whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder it is the companys understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent the company does not have any control over this process or over the brokers or dtc and it may take longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate such stockholders will have less time to make their investment decision than those stockholders that do not elect to exercise their redemption rights stockholders who request physical stock certificates and wish to redeem may be unable to meet the deadline for tendering their shares before exercising their redemption rights and thus will be unable to redeem their shares certificates andor shares that have not been tendered in accordance with these procedures by august   will not be redeemed for cash in the event that a public stockholder requests redemption and decides prior to the close of the redemption period that it does not want to redeem its shares the stockholder may withdraw the request if you delivered your shares for redemption to our transfer agent and decide prior to august   not to redeem your shares you may request that our transfer agent return the shares physically or electronically you may make such request by contacting our transfer agent at address listed above the company anticipates that a public stockholder who tenders shares for redemption in connection with the july redemption would receive payment of the redemption price for such shares soon after august   the company will hold the certificates of public stockholders that request redemption and deliver prior to august   until such shares are redeemed for cash or returned to such stockholders if properly demanded the company will redeem each public share for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account as of july   this would amount to approximately  per share if you exercise your redemption rights you will be exchanging your shares of the companys public shares for cash and will no longer own the shares
