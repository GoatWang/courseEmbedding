after about two dozen years in congress representative billy tauzin of louisiana was after bigger game — the giant pound whitetail deer that run through the area of south texas that hunters call the golden triangleso in  mr tauzin then chairman of the powerful energy and commerce committee made a deal though still on a modest congressional salary he paid more than  million for a acre ranch there and he invited a dozen friends — mostly executives and lobbyists with interests before his committee — to cover its mortgage by paying him dues as members of a new hunting club it did business as cajun creek llc based in the baton rouge office of a lobbyist who was a membernow seven years later mr tauzin’s friends say it is to his texas ranch that mr tauzin  will retreat to contemplate the apparent collapse of the grandest in a career of fearless deals — a pact to trade the drug industry’s political support for favorable terms under president obama’s proposed health care overhaulmr tauzin is leaving his  millionayear job as the top lobbyist for the drug industry amid complaints from drug makers that he bargained away their profits too cheaply spent too much in his  million advertising campaign to sell the overhaul and miscalculated in his assessment that the passage of the legislation was all but inevitable advertisement continue reading the main story other drug industry lobbyists speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly said his departure raised questions about whether the drug makers would continue to support the proposed overhaul which has stalled in congress continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story several of the lobbyists said mr tauzin was undermined by a rival lobbying powerhouse —thomas j donohue president of the united states chamber of commerce who had fought the health care proposals from the start and complained to the drug makers that mr tauzin had gone along too easily a spokesman for mr donohue declined to comment on mr donohue’s behalf and later released a statement from mr donohue praising mr tauzin as “a great friend” photo billy tauzin a former representative from louisiana is leaving his job as a drug industry lobbyist amid complaints from drug makers credit mike wintroathassociated press the agreement that mr tauzin struck on health care — capping the drug industry’s costs at  billion over  years and turning a perennial foe into a democratic ally — was in some ways a fitting climax to a career of such capers“i don’t know anybody else who could have made a deal like that and could have made it stick” said wallace henderson mr tauzin’s former chief of staff and one of the lobbyists in his hunting club “he was one of the best political and legislative strategists i have ever seen and i guess this sums it up he is the only member of congress who has ever served in the leadership of both parties”mr tauzin’s supporters in the drug industry trade group the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america known as phrma say that he was essentially undefeated in his five years representing the industry on capitol hill — beating back a phalanx of proposals to cut drug costs including allowing foreign imports or government price negotiationsbut in private drug company executives have long rolled their eyes at the “cajun in the capitol” routine that mr tauzin an aspiring actor in his youth had honed during his years in politicswilbert joseph tauzin ii the son of a poor electrician from of chackbay a small town in southern louisiana often joked that his alma mater nicholls state university was “the harvard of the bayou” he liked to open even the most solemn meetings with a joke about the antics of boudreau and thibodeau a dimwitted pair of bayou folk characters and for  years he has been a ringleader of the annual mardi gras celebration in washington when thousands of revelers take over a giant hilton hotel for a threeday party hosted by the louisiana congressional delegation and paid for by corporate sponsors and lobbyistsmr tauzin was elected to the house in  as a democrat but after the  republican takeover of congress cost him a committee chairmanship he complained that president bill clinton had failed to live up to a private deal to kill a certain energy tax from a bill mr tauzin had voted for in a housesenate conference photo thomas j donohue credit luke sharrettthe new york times citing that betrayal and mr clinton’s health care proposals mr tauzin switched parties and in the process he bargained with republican leaders to retain his seniority so that he soon became chairman of the new house energy and commerce committee that gave have him vast power over telecommunications media drugs and other industries advertisement continue reading the main story he set up his first hunting club — which included lobbyists as duespaying members — in the early s on a property about a hundred miles from the capitol on the eastern shore of maryland where he liked to shoot ducks when the congressional publication roll call first reported mr tauzin’s milliondollar purchase of the texas ranch in  his spokesman said that the house ethics committee had approved of the clubs and that mr tauzin himself paid the same dues as other membersnews of the purchase also fueled rumors around washington that mr tauzin still presiding over major pieces of legislation was seeking more lucrative work in  the motion picture association of america reportedly offered him a salary of about  million to become its top lobbyist then phrma lured him away from congress with its  millionayear offer newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a

favorable legislation for his lucrative job the house speaker nancy pelosi democrat of california said at the time “if you want to know the price of selling seniors down the river it’s approximately about  million a year if you want to hire the manager of the bill on the floor of the house of representatives”mr tauzin’s spokesman called the criticism sour grapes from opponents of the billdrug industry officials said friday that phrma’s board had grown increasingly wary of mr tauzin in recent monthshis party switch had alienated house democrats his jump to a lobbying job had embarrassed house republicans and his public threats to make the white house abide by his understanding of the industry deal on health care had irked the obama administrationone industry official pointed to a statement mr tauzin made in early august “who is ever going to go into a deal with the white house again if they don’t keep their word” mr tauzin said then “you are just going to duke it out instead”
