inc faces tough competition from both public and private ecommerce companiesrevenues are increasing year over year but at a decreasing ratenew products and services will enable the company to continue to grow market shareetsy can be considered as a potential growth investment with acceptable risk at or below  per sharethesis the intent of this article is to  review the etsy nasdaqetsy business model fundamental indicators technical indicators and competition  determine if etsy is a buy sell or hold data source tables table calculations  charts unless otherwise specified all financial data in this article was accessed from etradecom all tables table calculations and charts were created by the author company business model etsy inc operates a marketplace to connect people around the both online and offline for making selling and buying goods the companys geographical segments include united states and international the companys community includes etsy sellers etsy buyers wholesale partners manufacturers and etsy employees the companys platform includes a marketplace a seller services platform and technology and community both online and offline the company offers a range of services to help etsy sellers build their personal brands engage customers and complete transactions the company has over three seller services promoted listings direct checkout and shipping labels its promoted listings offering enables an etsy seller to pay a costperclickbased fee to feature and promote her goods in search results generated by etsy buyers on its platform its direct checkout offering allows etsy sellers to accept various forms of payment such as credit cards debit cards paypal and etsy gift cards source etsycom on march   etsy announced that it had filed for a  million ipo etsy now generates transactions around  billion on its platform which has  million members the lynch investment philosophy peter lynch took over the fidelity magellan fund in  at the time the fund assets were about m under his leadership the fund outperformed the market by a whopping  per year annualized lynch believed individual investors had an advantage over large institutions because large firms are unable or unwilling to invest in small caps that were not getting the attention of the analysts or mutual funds lynch authored several books on investing but his three basic investment rules are as follows  only buy what you understand  always do your homework  invest for the long run when it comes to understanding the etsy business model my wife is the expert she is a loyal etsy customer because of many pleasant purchase experiences she told me that with etsy she was able to work directly with a seller to make the perfect dog collar just for our puppy analysts price targets etrades price target of  is based on  ranked analyst estimates thomson reuters price target is  based on  ranked analyst estimates also on  march  blake harper of loop capital maintained his buy rating and a  price target on etsy despite the recent drop in share price following a below consensus revenue outlook annual revenue etsy is indeed growing however when you look at the percent change in revenue year over year the revenue growth is happening at a decreasing rate the table and chart below is a summary of annual revenue since  and also includes analysts estimates for years  yellow bars the red line in the bar chart shows the revenue growth trend growth is expensive what levers can etsy pull to reduce costs etsys primary operating expenses are cost of revenue sellinggenadmin expenses labor  related expenses and rd expenses the company has labor expenses under control with an average  of revenue cost of revenue is not likely to decrease much leaving sellinggenadmin and rd for potential cost reduction opportunities moving forward source company  k i would like to see the company reduce its sellinggenadmin expenses by  in  a savings that could go directly to its bottom line technical analysis after months of basing around the  support level the stock finally broke to the downside and is now selling for around  per share the recent  drop  attributed to a below consensus revenue outlook the stock price is well below both its  and day moving average the slow stochastics technical indicator is approaching the oversold  line the money flow technical indicator has been basing around  slightly above the oversold condition my opinion is that the stock is oversold below  per share and may represent an investment opportunity yearly chart with weekly candle stick bars stochastics  money flow index source etrade earnings per share there is nothing good about negative earnings however for a new company that went ipo in  the negative earnings are trending up towards greener pastures analysts are giving etsy the green light in  and beyond cash is king as of december  etsy had m on hand down from m cash flow per share is on the rise however free cash flow per share ie cash available after a company pays all its bills has been hovering around  since  going back to what i said above even a modest  reduction in sellinggenadmin expenses would raise the free cash flow per share line above zero debt as of december  total company debt was m the company has a revolving credit facility but no amounts have been drawn the company has very low debt ratios debtassets ratio   debtequity ratio   source company k analysts buysellhold recommendations based on etrade thomson reuters and zacks etsy is a hold recent etrade smart consensus peer ratings show  buys  holds and  sells data sources etrade thomson reuters zackscom competition publicly traded companies a fundamental data summary of publicly traded handmade companies the following table is a summary of fundamental data for etsy and the other public companies offering similar services for handmade buyers and sellers the tables above are sorted by market cap the definition of handmade first we need to define handmade well as it turns out it depends on who you ask both etsy and amazon nasdaq amzn have different definitions and rules amazon defines handmade as anything that is made entirely by hand handaltered or hand assembled by companies with less than  employees or collectives with less than  employees etsy defines handmade as anything made or designed by the seller if the seller uses outside help it must be approved by etsy most ecommerce businesses these days compete for customers with publicly traded companies such as amazon and ebay nasdaqebay so that is a given other publicly traded companies that etsy competes with include but may not be limited to alibaba nyse baba shopify nyseshop and leaf group nyselfgr amazon amazon launched handmade in october  to compete with etsys handmade business a typical  handmade dog collar search result from amazon is shown below… alibaba launched in  alibaba is chinese ecommerce company that provides consumertoconsumer businesstoconsumer and businesstobusiness sales services via web portals the company offers millions of products in over  different major categories including consumer electronics machinery and apparel the company does business in  countries and regions a typical  handmade dog collar search result from alibaba is shown below… i noticed in some cases like the one above that you have to buy in bulk which would not work for most individual buyers unless the intent was to resell making etsy the better or maybe easier choice for the typical handmade buyer ebay ebay like amazon sells everything my wife sells a lot of stuff on ebay however she does not buy handmade from ebay or amazon anytime she is looking to buy that special oneofakind item she uses etsy a typical  handmade dog collar search result from ebay is shown below… shopify and leaf group are ecommerce platform solutions for sellers although buyers would not typically buy from these websites i mention them here because they compete directly with etsy seller platforms competition privately owned companies the list of privately owned ecommerce companies in direct competition with etsy is a long one here are a few of the more popular ones… graphic  data toughnickelcom note etsy was included in the table above for comparison buyers and sellers both buyers and sellers are growing but at a decreasing rate so the future may appear cloudy but if there is a silver lining in the cloud cover it is buyers are increasing at a faster rate than sellers the red line in the charts below show the decreasing rate of buyers and sellers year over year data source etsy inc k new products and services spur growth and thus will improve flat buyer and seller growth new products  services no doubt etsy is facing some major headwinds ecommerce competition is as tough as it gets growing revenue at a decreasing rate can only be sustained for so long the only way to survive is to keep coming up with new and innovative products and services i think etsy is doing just that  completed projects launched pattern by etsy a fourth paid seller service expanded direct checkout into  new countries added expedited united states postal service shipping labels partnered with google to launch google shopping tool added search and machine learning capabilities with the acquisition of blackbird technologies and launched a global brand campaign called difference makes us to highlight etsy as a goto shopping destination for buyers around the world  launched shop manager shop manager can track seller orders manage inventory view metrics and statistics and have conversations with buyers for all of their etsy channels in one place its a centralized operating hub for sellers to manage all aspects of their etsy businesses  etsy studio and multishop the company announced plans to launch a market dedicated to craft supplies etsy studio will enable craft supplies sellers to tap into a larger audience of crafters makers and diy enthusiasts around the world the market will offer millions of listings along with content such as tutorials and craft ideas so buyers will be able to find both materials and inspiration for their next projects launching a multishop checkout system that will enable buyers to complete purchases from multiple sellers with direct checkout in one simple transaction and guest checkout will allow buyers to make purchases from sellers without creating or signing into an etsy account source etsy inc website conclusion etsy is a young and growing company facing tough competition from both public and private ecommerce companies etsy customers are loyal and keep coming back revenues are increasing year over year but at a decreasing rate and general  admin expenses are on the rise not a good combination for sustaining growth both buyers and sellers are increasing but at a decreasing rate however buyers are increasing at a faster rate than sellers etsy has positioned itself well in a niche market and i think is ahead of its competition in terms of new products and services that will enable the company to continue to grow i believe etsy will continue to grow its market share and should be considered

quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march   first quarter  operational highlights during the first quarter we laid the groundwork for key initiatives and launches that will enhance etsys capabilities and offerings for sellers and buyers strengthen the brand and help position etsy for longterm growth continued chad etsy is actively investing in machine learning search and marketing to attract new buyers and drive purchase frequency additionally we just completed the successful launch of etsy studio although a challenging february contributed to lower than anticipated first quarter results i am confident that the fundamental strength of etsys business and its unique competitive position will drive longterm growth for all stakeholders gms was  million up  compared with the first quarter of  on a currencyneutral basis excluding the direct impact of currency translation on gms from goods that are not listed in us dollars gms growth in the first quarter of  would have been  growth in gms was supported by  yearoveryear growth in active sellers and  yearoveryear growth in active buyers continuing the trend weve seen for multiple quarters mobile visits once again grew faster than desktop visits percent mobile visits was approximately  compared with approximately  in the first quarter of  and approximately  in the fourth quarter of  percent mobile gms was approximately  compared with  in the first quarter of  and  in the fourth quarter of  during the first quarter of  mobile gms was more than  of overall gms for the first time specifically mobile web was the largest contributor to both overall visits as well as mobile gms yearoveryear aggregate conversion rate increased despite the growing contribution of mobile web which carries the lowest conversion rate of any device in addition conversion rate on every device  desktop mobile web and mobile app  increased for the sixth consecutive quarter during the first quarter the yearoveryear growth in mobile conversion rates led to a slight narrowing of the gap between mobile visits and mobile gms mobile app and mobile web gms each continued to grow significantly faster than desktop gms during the first quarter percent international gms was  in the first quarter of  up from  in the first quarter of  and up sequentially from  in the fourth quarter of  notably international gms growth accelerated yearoveryear for the fourth consecutive quarter during the first quarter of  percent international gms was largely driven by continued robust gms growth between us buyers and international sellers and gms growth between buyers and sellers outside of the us both in the same country and crossborder gms growth between international buyers and sellers in the same country remained the fastest growing category of international gms growing  yearoveryear during the first quarter we believe the robust growth in this category demonstrates the progress we are making in building and deepening local etsy communities around the world gms between us sellers and international buyers declined  yearoveryear in the first quarter an improvement from the trends we experienced in  and  expense reductions and resource realignment late last year etsy realigned its teams to better support the evolving needs of our business this has resulted in strengthened crossfunctional collaboration increased accountability and faster execution building on this foundation early in the second quarter of  we also looked for opportunities to increase efficiency and streamline our cost structure as a result of this process we have identified savings that will be realized through a combination of headcount reductions and a reduction in internal program expenses in total we expect to eliminate approximately  positions which is approximately  of the total workforce chad commented today we announced an expense reduction and realignment initiative to help position etsy for growth etsys business has evolved significantly over the past  years and while decisions like these are never easy the board is confident that this initiative will give the company greater focus and agility in the near term while allowing the company to continue expanding in key growth areas i wish everyone who was affected the absolute best in whatever they choose to do next recent operational highlights our product roadmap is focused on supporting sellers as they start manage and scale their businesses and enhancing the buyer experience recent highlights include etsy studio launch last week we launched etsy studio etsy studio is the first new market that weve built since  and will disrupt the global craft buying and selling experience by offering a differentiated and category specific buyer experience we believe etsy studio will allow us to gain share in the large addressable craft supplies market on etsy studio at the time of launch our global craft sellers offered nearly eight million items to buyers around the world product launches we are using machine learning to make categoryspecific suggestions to improve the listing process and collect more accurate data our efforts around structured data will enable us to collect more attributes and information from sellers during the listing process so we can offer more advanced and relevant search filters and deliver more personalized recommendations this will allow buyers to more quickly find the exact items for which they are searching we recently updated our direct checkout payment service and rebranded it as etsy payments our ultimate goal with etsy payments is to offer all etsy sellers and buyers one unified payments platform for sellers etsy payments offers a more flexible and easy way to manage how and when they receive payments and deposits buyers have access to  different payment options including android pay for mobile app launched in march additionally our recent launches of multishop checkout and guest checkout enable buyers to seamlessly purchase from multiple sellers in one transaction and check out without being signed into an etsy account respectively we believe these collective enhancements can drive conversion and gms growth by reducing friction in the checkout process creating a unified business management offering for sellers since our february launch of shop manager a centralized hub for sellers to manage all aspects of their etsy business we have received positive feedback from a number of sellers using the new platform we believe this was an important step towards building a unified business management offering to help our sellers start manage and scale their businesses shop manager showcases the breadth and depth of our services and tools in one

prepare and approve our annual budget develop short and longterm operating plans determine incentive compensation and assess the health of our business as our adjusted ebitda increases we are able to invest more in our platform we believe that adjusted ebitda can provide a useful measure for periodtoperiod comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain noncash items and certain variable charges adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of stockbased compensation expense adjusted ebitda does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of foreign exchange gain adjusted ebitda does not reflect other nonoperating expenses net of other nonoperating income including net interest expense and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including net income loss and our other gaap

to his perspective on etsy dickerson described the website as a platform that provides meaning to people and an opportunity to validate their art their craft and after spending time with etsy users dickerson learned that all commerce is about real human interaction dickerson also provided a summation of etsy that is a further reflection of the companys relationship and meaningbased ethos at the end of every transaction you get something real from a real person there is an existential satisfaction to that competitorsedit as of march  etsys top three competitors according to hoovers online are amazon handmade craigslist and ebay etsy has been compared to a crafty cross between amazon and ebay and to your grandmas basement etsy also has a number of direct competitors dawanda based in germany

united states and focuses on clothing and fashion zibbet and made it which are based in australia icraft is based in canada artfire is based in the united states and hello pretty is an online craft marketplace targeted at south africans tindie is based in portland oregon and focuses on technology and electronics asked about competitors etsys european ceo said as far as i am concerned the more people highlighting the value of supporting microproducers and buying handmade and vintage directly from them the better seller issuesedit privacyedit in an effort to add social networking features to etsy the company implemented features in  that allowed users to search other users buying histories and to trace their purchasing transactions etsy thought that this feature would allow etsy users to connect to individuals with similar buying andor selling histories and an automatic optin was applied to all users without the attainment of prior permission users of the service raised concerns over the features violation of privacy rights but an official response was not released by the company ecologica malibuedit in april  some etsy users began requesting the removal of ecologica malibu from the website due to the shops use of a wholesale manufacturer users complained that ecologica malibus practice was contradictory to the antibig business values of etsy ceo chad dickerson responded in an etsy blog post much of the information we learn from investigations can’t be shared with the larger community out of respect for the privacy of the seller being investigated so there is a natural divergence between what the community sees when they report a seller and what we see as we go deeper on the case … there are times when available public evidence suggests that a violation of our policy is clear and our investigations find that it’s actually not the case many users are still not content with dickersons response production outsourcingedit on oct   etsy changed its policy to allow sellers to outsource production to third parties and factories and to use shipping or fulfillment services the new rules allow products to be labeled handmade as long as the original idea for that item — or its authorship as ceo dickerson says — comes from its respective seller further the policy changes allow etsy businesses to hire as many employees as they deem necessary including workers in different locations and allow sellers to ship orders via thirdparty couriers rather than the post office the move has prompted at least one etsy competitor to distinguish itself by committing never to sell manufactured items in september  etsy made further changes to its manufacturing policy with the launch of etsy manufacturing a marketplace allowing sellers to connect with outside manufacturers to fabricate their products manufacturers must be reviewed and approved by etsy to ensure they adhere to certain criteria although etsy will not conduct visits or inperson inspections sellers must apply and be approved to work with any partners listed on etsy manufacturing and are required to disclose their use of outside manufacturers on their pages see alsoedit tech

the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their

and help position etsy for longterm growth continued chad etsy is actively investing in machine learning search and marketing to attract new buyers and drive purchase frequency additionally we just completed the successful launch of etsy studio although a challenging february contributed to lower than anticipated first quarter results i am confident that the fundamental strength of etsys

impact of currency translation on gms from goods that are not listed in us dollars gms growth in the first quarter of  would have been  growth in gms was supported by  yearoveryear growth in active

yearoveryear aggregate conversion rate increased despite the growing contribution of mobile web which carries the lowest conversion rate of any device in addition conversion rate on every device  desktop mobile web and mobile app  increased for the sixth consecutive quarter during the first quarter the yearoveryear growth in mobile conversion rates led to a slight narrowing of the gap between

the same country and crossborder gms growth between international buyers and sellers in the same country remained the fastest growing category of international gms growing  yearoveryear during the first quarter we believe the robust growth in this category demonstrates the progress we are making in building and deepening local etsy communities around the world gms between us sellers and international buyers declined  yearoveryear in the first quarter an improvement from the trends we experienced in  and  expense reductions and resource realignmentlate last year etsy realigned its teams to better support the evolving needs of our business this has resulted in strengthened crossfunctional collaboration increased accountability and faster execution building on this foundation early in the second quarter of  we also looked for opportunities to increase efficiency and streamline our cost structure as a result of this process we have identified savings that will be realized through a combination of headcount reductions and a reduction in internal program expenses in total we expect to eliminate approximately  positions which is approximately  of the total workforcechad commented today we announced an expense reduction and realignment initiative to help position etsy for growth etsys business has evolved significantly over the past  years and while decisions like these are never easy the board is confident that this initiative will give the company greater focus and agility in the near term while allowing the company to continue expanding in key growth areas i

their businesses and enhancing the buyer experience recent highlights includeetsy studio launchlast week we launched etsy studio etsy studio is the first new market that weve built since  and will disrupt the global craft buying and selling experience by offering a differentiated and category specific buyer experience we believe etsy studio will allow us to gain share in the large addressable craft supplies market on etsy studio at the time of launch our global craft sellers offered nearly eight million items to buyers around the worldproduct launcheswe are using machine learning to make categoryspecific suggestions to improve the listing process and collect more accurate data our efforts around structured data will enable us to collect more attributes and information from sellers during the listing process so we can offer more advanced and relevant search filters and deliver more personalized recommendations this will allow buyers to more quickly find the exact items for which they are searching we recently updated our direct checkout payment service and rebranded it as etsy payments our ultimate goal with etsy payments is to offer all etsy sellers and buyers one unified payments platform for sellers etsy payments offers a more flexible and easy way to manage how and when they receive payments and deposits buyers have access to  different payment options including android pay for mobile app launched in march additionally our recent launches of multishop checkout and guest checkout enable buyers to seamlessly purchase from multiple sellers in one transaction and

direct impact of currency translation on gms from goods that are not listed in us dollars gms growth in the fourth quarter of  would have been  gms growth was driven by  yearoveryear growth in active

flat compared with the third quarter of  yearoveryear conversion rates increased across desktop mobile web and mobile app for the fifth consecutive quarter during the fourth quarter the yearoveryear growth in mobile gms together with the strength in overall mobile conversion rates resulted in a slight narrowing of the gap between mobile visits and mobile gms mobile app and mobile web gms each continued to grow significantly faster than desktop gms during the fourth quarter percent international gms was  in the fourth quarter of  up from  in the fourth quarter of  and flat compared with the third quarter of  during the fourth quarter of  percent international gms was largely driven by continued robust gms growth between us buyers and international sellers and gms growth between buyers and sellers outside of the us both in the same country and crossborder gms growth between international buyers and sellers in the same country remained the fastest growing category of international gms gms between international buyers and sellers in the same country grew  yearoveryear during the fourth quarter and has grown from our smallest gms category to be more similar in size to gms between international buyers and sellers in different countries both of these gms categories are now larger than gms between us sellers and international buyers we believe the robust growth in gms between international buyers and sellers in the same country demonstrates the progress we are making on our strategy to build and deepen local etsy communities around the world gms between us sellers and international buyers declined  in the fourth quarter while we continue to believe that the decline in this gms category is indicative of the indirect impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on international buyer behavior given this gms categorys size relative to other gms categories the indirect impact of fluctuating currency has become less of a headwind to our gms growth recent operational highlights throughout  we launched products and services to complement our markets and services platform to help our sellers around the world turn their creative passion into a business

drive an increase in product development expenses as a percent of revenue in  we will recognize additional product development expenses of approximately  million in the first quarter of  and approximately  million per quarter over the next three years this amount will consist of contingent consideration in the form of both stock and cash compensation expense of approximately  million and amortization expense related to the acquired intangible asset of approximately  million we expect ga expense as a percent of revenue to decline in  based on these factors we expect  adjusted ebitda margin to range between  and  excluding our brand marketing investment  adjusted ebitda margin would be approximately flat compared with  etsy is not able at this time to provide gaap targets for net income margin for the full year  and  because of the unreasonable effort of estimating certain noncash items that are excluded from nongaap adjusted ebitda margin including provision for income taxes
