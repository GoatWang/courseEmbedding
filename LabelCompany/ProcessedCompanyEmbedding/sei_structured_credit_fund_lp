significant accounting policies continued   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the funds financial statements are reasonable and prudent however actual results could differ from these estimates and it is reasonably possible that differences could be material valuation of investments cdos and other structured credit investments are priced based upon valuations provided by independent third party pricing agents using their proprietary valuation methodology the thirdparty pricing agents may value structured credit investments at an evaluated bid price by employing methodologies that utilize actual market transactions brokersupplied valuations or other methodologies designed to identify the market value for such securities such methodologies generally consider such factors as security prices yields maturities call features ratings and developments relating to specific securities in arriving at valuations if a price for a cdo or other structured credit investment cannot be obtained from an independent thirdparty pricing agent the fund shall seek to obtain a bid price from at least one dealer who is independent of the fund in such cases the independent dealer providing the price on the cdo or structured credit investment may also be a market maker and in many cases the only market maker with respect to that security as of december   all assetbacked securities are valued by an independent dealer who is also a market maker a dealers valuation reflects its judgment of the price of an asset assuming an arms length transaction at the valuation date between knowledgeable willing market participants and sufficient time in advance of the valuation date to market the instrument it generally assumes a round lot institutional transaction without consideration for whether the client is long or short the instrument and without adjustment for the size of the clients position the valuation pertains to an assumed transaction does not necessarily reflect actual quoted or other prices and does not indicate that an active market exists for the financial instrument    table of contents sei structured credit fund lp notes to financial statements continued december      significant accounting policies continued   valuation of investments continued a dealers valuation may be formulated using inputs such as a combination of observable market transactions of the exact security or a similar security and internal models bidswantedin competition or bwics are widely distributed auctions of securities whose results are the primary input used by dealers to establish valuations for structured credit securities dealers supplement bwic results with private transactions and modeldriven valuations modeldriven valuations require assumptions regarding default recovery and prepayment rates that are consistent with current market conditions in situations where market inputs are not available or do not provide a sufficient basis under current market conditions for pricing the instrument the valuation may reflect the dealers view of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument since market participants may have materially different views as to future supply demand credit quality and other factors relevant to pricing financial instruments as well as bid and ask prices valuations may differ materially among dealers the actual level at which these instruments trade if trades occur could be materially different from the dealers valuation debt obligations with remaining maturities of sixty days or less may be valued at their amortized cost which approximates fair value investments in openended investment companies are valued based on reported nav of the investment company securities for which market prices are not readily available or may be unreliable are valued in accordance with fair value procedures established by the board the funds fair value procedures are implemented through a fair value committee the committee designated by the board when a security is valued in accordance with the fair value procedures the committee will determine the value after taking into consideration relevant information reasonably available to the committee examples of factors the committee may consider are the last trade price the performance of the market or of the issuers industry the liquidity of the security the size of the holding in the fund or any other appropriate information the determination of a securitys fair value price often involves the consideration of a number of subjective factors and is therefore subject to the unavoidable risk that the value assigned to a security may be higher or lower than the securitys value would be if a reliable market quotation for the security was readily available at december   there were no securities that were fair valued by the committee    table of contents sei structured credit fund lp notes to financial statements continued december      significant accounting policies continued   valuation of investments concluded certain structured credit investments may be structured as private investment partnerships traditionally a trading market for holdings of this type does not exist the fair value of the funds interest in such a private investment fund will represent the amount that the fund could reasonably expect to receive from the private investment fund if the funds interest were sold at the time of valuation determined based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the fund believes to be reliable unless determined otherwise in accordance with the funds fair value procedures the fair value of the funds interest in a private investment fund will usually be the value attributed to such interest as of that time of valuation as reported to the fund by the private investment funds manager administrator or other designed agent as a practical matter the adviser and the board have little or no means of independently verifying the valuations provided by such private investment funds in the unlikely event that a private investment fund does not report a value to the fund on a timely basis and such fund is not priced by independent pricing agents of the fund the fund committee would determine the fair value of the private investment fund based on the most recent value reported by the private investment fund as well as any other relevant information available at the time the fund values its portfolio as of december   there were no securities fair valued in accordance with the funds fair value procedures the board will periodically review the funds valuation policies and will update them as necessary to reflect changes in the types of securities in which the fund invests fair value of financial instruments in accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosure under gaap the fund discloses the fair value of its investments in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure the fair value the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price    table of contents sei structured credit fund lp notes to financial statements continued december      significant accounting policies continued   fair value of financial instruments continued accordingly the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities that the fund has the ability to access at the measurement date level   observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data which includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions including time value yield curve volatility factors prepayment speeds default rates loss severity current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as other relevant economic measures substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace level   unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data supported by little or no market activity which is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies utilizing significant inputs that are generally less readily observable investments are classified within the level of the lowest significant input considered in determining fair value investments classified within level  whose fair value measurement considers several inputs may include level  or level  inputs as components of the overall fair value measurement for the year ended december   there have been no significant changes to the funds fair valuation methodologies    table of

transactions are recorded on the trade date for financial reporting purposes costs used in determining net realized capital gains and losses on the sale of securities are on the basis of specific identification dividend income is recognized on the exdividend date and interest income is recognized using the accrual basis of accounting except for certain heavily subordinated collateralized loan obligations clos for which the fund cannot reasonably estimate performance amortization and accretion is calculated using the scientific interest method which approximates the effective interest method over the estimated life of the security amortization of premiums and discounts are included in interest income collateralized debt obligations the fund invests in cdos which include clos and other similarly structured securities clos are a type of assetbacked security a clo is a trust typically collateralized by a pool of loans which may include among others domestic and foreign senior secured loans senior unsecured loans and subordinate corporate loans including loans that may be rated below investment grade or equivalent unrated loans cdos may charge management fees and administrative expenses for cdos the cashflows from the trust are split into two or more portions called tranches varying in risk and yield the riskiest portion is the equity tranche which bears the bulk of defaults from the bonds or loans in the trust and serves to protect the other more senior tranches from default in all but the most severe circumstances since it is partially protected from defaults a senior tranche from a cdo trust typically has a higher rating and lower yield than their underlying securities and can be rated investment grade despite the protection from the equity tranche cdo tranches can experience substantial losses due to actual defaults increased sensitivity to defaults due to collateral default and disappearance of protecting tranches market anticipation of defaults as well as aversion to cdo securities as a class the risks of an investment in a cdo depend largely on the type of the collateral securities and the class of the cdo in which the fund invests normally clos and other cdos are privately offered and sold and thus are not registered under the securities laws as a result investments in cdos may be characterized by the fund as illiquid securities however an active dealer market may exist for cdos allowing a cdo to qualify for rule a transactions    table of contents sei structured credit fund lp notes to financial statements continued december      significant accounting policies continued   collateralized debt obligations continued in addition to the normal risks associated with fixed income securities eg interest rate risk and default risk cdos carry additional risks including but not limited to i the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments ii the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default iii the fund may invest in cdos that are subordinate to other classes and iv the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results federal taxes the fund intends to be treated as a partnership for federal state and local income tax purposes the limited partners are responsible for the tax liability or benefit relating to its distributive share of taxable income or loss accordingly no provision for federal state or local income taxes is reflected in the accompanying financial statements for the period ended december   in accordance with the accounting guidance provided in the aicpa audit and accounting guide audits of investment companies the fund reclassified  and  from accumulated net investment income and accumulated net realized gain respectively to net limited partners capital the reclassification was to reflect as an adjustment to net limited partners capital the amount of taxable income that has been allocated to the limited partners and has no effect on net assets the fund evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the funds tax returns to determine whether it is morelikelythannot ie greater than percent that each tax position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position tax positions not deemed to meet the morelikelythannot threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense

performance risk the funds market risk management strategy is driven by the funds investment objective the adviser oversees each of the risks in accordance with policies and procedures i price risk price risk is the risk the value of the instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment its issuer or any factor affecting financial instruments traded in the market as all of the funds financial instruments are carried at fair value with fair value changes recognized in the statement of operations all changes in market conditions directly affect net assets ii interest rate risk the fair value of the funds investments will change in response to interest rate changes and other factors during periods of falling interest rates the values of fixed income securities generally rise conversely during periods of rising interest rates the values of such securities generally decline changes by recognized rating agencies in the ratings of any fixed income security and in the ability of an issuer to make payments of interest and principal may also affect the value of these investments iii prepayment risk prepayment risk is the risk associated with the early unscheduled return of principal on a fixedincome security some fixedincome securities such as cdos have embedded call options which may be exercised by the issuer or in the case of a cdo the borrower the yieldtomaturity of such securities cannot be known for certain at the time of purchase since the cash flows are not known when principal is returned early future interest payments will not be paid on that part of the principal if the security was purchased at a premium a price greater than  the securitys yield will be less than what was estimated at the time of purchase iv collateral performance risk collateral performance risk is the risk that defaults or underperformance of the cdos underlying collateral negatively

shareholders typically have the right to vote on various corporate issues clients typically delegate to simc the authority to vote proxies for shares they own under the advisers act simc has a duty of care and loyalty with respect to all services undertaken for clients including proxy voting rule  under the advisers act requires that simc must vote proxies in a manner consistent with clients best interest and must not place its interests above those of its clients when doing so it requires simc to i adopt and implement written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that simc votes proxies in the best interest of its clients and ii to disclose to the clients how they may obtain information on how simc voted proxies in addition rule  requires simc to keep records of proxy voting and client requests for information as a registered investment adviser simc has an obligation to vote proxies with respect to securities held in its client portfolios in the best economic interests of the clients for which it has proxy voting authority procedures simc has adopted the following procedures to implement the firms policy and to monitor compliance with the firms policy  third party proxy voting servicesimc has elected to retain a third party proxy voting service the service to vote proxies with respect to those clients the service shall vote proxies in accordance with guidelines approved by simcs proxy voting committee the guidelines the guidelines set forth the manner in which simc shall vote or the manner in which simc shall determine how to vote with respect to various matters that may come up for shareholder vote so long as the service votes proxies in accordance with the guidelines simc believes that there is an appropriate presumption that the manner in table of contents which simc voted was not influenced by and did not result from a conflict of interest simc compliance shall conduct periodic reviews of the service to ensure compliance with simcs proxy voting guidelines and the appropriateness of the service  establishment of proxy voting committeesimc shall establish a proxy voting committee the committee comprised of representatives of simcs investment management unit and legal andor compliance personnel currently the members of the committee are as follows brad mook greg mcintire aimei zhong noreen procaccini stephanie cavanagh tom williams the membership of the committee may be changed at any time upon approval of the existing members of the committee or by the president of simc the committee shall meet as necessary to perform any of the activities set forth below any action requiring approval of the committee shall be deemed approved upon an affirmative vote by a majority of the committee present or represented the submission of votes electronically ie via email by the committee members shall be considered acceptable the committee shall consult with counsel or other experts as it deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities  approval of proxy voting guidelinesthe committee shall approve guidelines that set forth the manner in which simc shall vote or the manner in which simc shall determine how to vote with respect to various matters that may come up for shareholder vote with respect to securities held in client accounts and for which simc has proxy voting responsibility in the event that any employee of simc recommends a change to simcs guidelines the committee shall meet to consider the proposed change and consider all relevant factors if approved by the committee the change shall be accepted and the guidelines revised accordingly  certain proxy votes may not be castin some cases the committee may determine that it is in the best interests of simcs clients to abstain from voting certain proxies simc will abstain from voting in the event any of the following conditions  are met with regard to a proxy proposal        neither the proxy voting guidelines nor specific client instructions cover an issue        the service does not make a recommendation on the issue        in circumstances where in simcs judgment the costs of voting the proxy exceed the expected benefits to clients or        the committee cannot convene on the proxy proposal at issue to make a determination as to what would be in the clients best interest this could happen for example if the committee found that there was a material conflict or if despite all best efforts the committee is unable to meet the requirements necessary to make a determination in addition it is simcs policy not to vote proxies for accounts that engage in securities lending simc believes that the additional income derived by clients from such activities generally outweighs the potential economic benefit of recalling securities for the purpose of voting therefore simc generally will not recall securities on loan for the sole purpose of voting proxies further in accordance with local law or business practices many foreign companies prevent the sales of shares that have been voted for a certain period beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and ending on the day following the meeting share blocking depending on the country in which a company is domiciled the blocking period may begin a stated number of days prior to the meeting eg one three or five days or on a date established by the company while practices vary in many countries the block period can be continued for a longer period if the shareholder meeting is adjourned and postponed to a later date similarly practices vary widely as to the ability of a shareholder to have the block restriction lifted early eg in some countries shares generally can be unblocked up to two days prior to the meeting whereas in other countries the removal of the block appears to be discretionary with the issuers transfer agent simc believes that the disadvantage table of contents of being unable to sell the stock regardless of changing conditions generally outweighs the advantages of voting at the shareholder meeting for routine items accordingly simc generally will not vote those proxies subject to share blocking  proxies of investment companieswith respect to proxies of an affiliated investment company or series thereof such as the sei funds the committee will vote such proxies in the same proportion as the vote of all other shareholders of the investment company or series thereof ie echo vote or mirror vote when required by law the committee will also echo vote proxies of an unaffiliated investment company when not required to echo vote the committee will delegate to the service responsibility for voting proxies of an unaffiliated investment company in accordance with guidelines approved by the committee provided that if such proxy presents a material conflict of interest for simc such proxy shall be voted in accordance with section  below  conflicts of interestthe service makes available to simc prior to voting on a proxy its recommendation on how to vote with respect to such proxy in light of simcs guidelines simc retains the authority to overrule the services recommendation and instruct the service to vote in a manner at variance with the services recommendation the exercise of such right could implicate a conflict of interest as a result simc may not overrule the services recommendation with respect to a proxy unless the following steps are taken     a the committee shall meet to consider the proposal to overrule the services recommendation     b the committee must determine whether simc has a conflict of interest with respect to the issuer that is the subject of the proxy the committee will use the following standards to identify issuers with which it may have a conflict of interest      significant business relationships  the committee will determine whether simc or its affiliates may have a significant business relationship with the issuer such as for example where simc or an affiliate manages a pension plan administers employee benefit plans or provide brokerage underwriting insurance or banking services to the issuer for this purpose a significant business relationship is one that  represents  or  of simcs or an affiliates revenues for the most recent fiscal year whichever is less or is reasonably expected to represent this amount for the current fiscal year or  may not directly involve revenue to simc or its affiliates but is otherwise determined by the committee to be significant to simc or its affiliates such as for example the following        simc or its affiliates lease significant office space from the company or have some other real estaterelated relationship with the issuer        simc or an affiliate otherwise has a significant relationship with the company such that it might create an incentive for simc to vote in favor of management      significant personalfamily relationships  the committee will determine whether any employees who are involved in the proxy voting process may have a significant personalfamily relationship with the issuer for this purpose a significant personalfamily relationship is one that would be reasonably likely to influence how simc votes proxies to identify any such relationships the committee shall obtain information about any significant personalfamily relationship between any employee of simc who is involved in the proxy voting process eg imu analysts members of the committee senior management as applicable and senior employees of issuers for which simc may vote proxies      duties of the proxy committeethe committee has a duty to make reasonable investigation of information relating to conflicts of interest for purposes of table of contents   identifying conflicts the committee shall rely on publicly available information about simc and its affiliates information about simc and its affiliates that is generally known by employees of simc and other information actually known by a member of the committee absent actual knowledge the committee is not required to investigate possible conflicts involving simc where the information is i nonpublic ii subject to information blocking procedures or iii otherwise not readily available to the committee in connection with the consideration of any proxy voting matters under this policy each member of the committee has a duty to disclose to the committee any material conflicts of interest of which the member has actual knowledge but which have not been identified by the committee pursuant to these procedures and if appropriate recuse himselfherself from the matter at issue     c if simc determines that it has a conflict of interest the committee shall determine whether the conflict is material to any specific proposal included within the proxy if not then simc can vote the proxy as determined by the committee the committee shall determine whether a proposal is material as follows      routine proxy proposals  proxy proposals that are routine shall be presumed not to involve a material conflict of interest for simc unless the committee has actual knowledge that a routine proposal should be treated as material for this purpose routine proposals would typically include matters such as the selection of an accountant uncontested election of directors meeting formalities and approval of an annual reportfinancial statements       nonroutine proxy proposals  proxy proposals that are nonroutine shall be presumed to involve a material conflict of interest for simc unless the committee determines that simcs conflict is unrelated to the proposal in question see  below for this purpose nonroutine proposals would typically include any contested matter including a contested election of directors a merger or sale of substantial assets a change in the articles of incorporation that materially affects the rights of shareholders and compensation matters for management eg stock option plans retirement plans profit sharing or other special remuneration plans      determining that a nonroutine proposal is not material  as discussed above although nonroutine proposals are presumed to involve a material conflict of interest the committee may determine on a casebycase basis that particular nonroutine proposals do not involve a material conflict of interest to make this determination the committee must conclude that a proposal is not directly related to simcs conflict with the issuer or that it otherwise would not be considered important by a reasonable investor the committee shall record in writing the basis for any such determination     d for any proposal where the committee determines that simc has a material conflict of interest simc may vote a proxy regarding that proposal in any of the following manners      obtain client consent or direction  if the committee approves the proposal to overrule the recommendation of the service simc shall fully disclose to each client holding the security at issue the nature of the conflict and obtain the clients consent     the procedures provide that the committee should be aware of information about simc or its affiliates that is generally known by employees of simc but it does not extend this knowledge to information about simcs affiliates that is generally known by employees of simcs affiliates unless such information also is generally known by simcs employees   for guidance on defining routine and nonroutine matters simc shall use the standards set forth in nyse rule  and special instruction bviii of form f table of contents to how simc will vote on the proposal or otherwise obtain instructions from the client as to how the proxy on the proposal should be voted      use recommendation of the service  vote in accordance with the services recommendation     e for any proposal where the committee determines that simc does not have a material conflict of interest the committee may overrule the services recommendation if the committee reasonably determines that doing so is in the best interests of simcs clients if the committee decides to overrule the services recommendation the committee shall maintain a written record setting forth the basis of the committees decision     f this section  does not apply to voting proxies of an investment company except as specifically stated in section  above   item  portfolio managers of closedend management investment

interests each portfolio managers management of other accounts may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in connection with his management of the funds investments on the one table of contents hand and the investments of the other accounts on the other the other accounts include portions of two us registered high yield mutual funds and an irish registered high yield fund collectively the other accounts the other accounts might have similar investment objectives as the fund or hold purchase or sell securities that are eligible to be held purchased or sold by the fund while the portfolio managers management of the other accounts may give rise to the following potential conflicts of interest the adviser does not believe that the conflicts if any are material or to the extent any such conflicts are material the adviser believes that it has designed policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage those conflicts in an appropriate way knowledge of the timing and size of fund trades a potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers daytoday management of the fund because of their position with the fund the portfolio managers know the size timing and possible market impact of fund trades it is theoretically possible that the portfolio managers could use this information to the advantage of the other accounts and to the possible detriment of the fund however the adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time investment opportunities a potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers management of the fund and the other accounts which in theory may allow them to allocate investment opportunities in a way that favors the other accounts over the fund this conflict of interest may be exacerbated to the extent that the adviser or the portfolio managers receive or expect to receive greater compensation from their management of the other accounts than the fund notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest it is the advisers policy to manage each account based on its investment objectives and related restrictions and as discussed above the adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time and in a manner consistent with each accounts investment objectives and related restrictions for example while the portfolio managers may buy for an other account securities that differ in identity or quantity from securities bought for the fund such an approach might not be suitable for the fund given its investment objectives and related restrictions the adviser may enter into incentive fee arrangements with one or more investors in the sei structured credit segregated portfolio the offshore feeder fund a segregated portfolio of sei offshore advanced strategies series spc a segregated portfolio company established in the cayman islands that acts as a feeder fund for the fund whereby a portion of the increase in the net asset value of such investors investment in the offshore feeder fund over a given period shall be payable to the adviser this arrangement may create an incentive for the adviser to make investments for the fund that are riskier or more speculative than if the adviser had no such interest because the adviser will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation in the value of the offshore feeder funds assets if the value of its investment in the fund declines notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest it is the advisers policy to manage each account based on its investment objectives and related restrictions and the adviser believes that it has designed policies and procedures that are designed to manage such conflict in an appropriate way   item  purchases of equity securities by closedend

interested persons as defined in the  act with respect to the fund  sei structured credit fund lp notes to financial statements continued december    significant accounting policies continued the following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the fund use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the funds financial statements are reasonable and prudent however actual results could differ from these estimates valuation of investments cdos and other structured credit investments are priced based upon valuations provided by independent thirdparty pricing agents if available such values generally reflect the last reported sales price if the security is actively traded the thirdparty pricing agents may also value structured credit investments at an evaluated bid price by employing methodologies that utilize actual market transactions brokersupplied valuations or other methodologies designed to identify the market value for such securities such methodologies generally consider such factors as security prices yields maturities call features ratings and developments relating to specific securities in arriving at valuations if a price for a cdo or other structured credit investment cannot be obtained from an independent thirdparty pricing agent the fund shall seek to obtain a bid price from at least one independent broker in such cases it is possible that the independent broker providing the price on the cdo or structured credit investment is also a market maker and in many cases the only market maker with respect to that security securities listed on a securities exchange market or automated quotation system for which quotations are readily available except for securities traded on nasdaq are valued at the last quoted sale price on the primary exchange or market foreign or domestic on which they are traded or if there is no such reported sale at the most recent quoted bid price for securities traded on nasdaq the nasdaq official closing price will be used the prices of foreign securities are reported in local currency and converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates debt obligations with remaining maturities of sixty days or less may be valued at their amortized cost which approximates market value  sei structured credit fund lp notes to financial statements continued december    significant accounting policies continued valuation of investments continued securities for which market prices are not readily available or may be unreliable are valued in accordance with fair value procedures established by the board the funds fair value procedures are implemented through a fair value committee the committee designated by the board when a security is valued in accordance with the fair value procedures the committee will determine the value after taking into consideration relevant information reasonably available to the committee examples of factors the committee may consider are the facts giving rise to the need to fair value the last trade price the performance of the market or of the issuers industry the liquidity of the security the size of the holding in the fund or any other appropriate information the determination of a securitys fair value price often involves the consideration of a number of subjective factors and is therefore subject to the unavoidable risk that the value assigned to a security may be higher or lower than the securitys value would be if a reliable market quotation for the security was readily available certain structured credit investments may be structured as private investment partnerships traditionally a trading market for holdings of this type does not exist as a general matter the fair value of the funds interest in such a private investment fund will represent the amount that the fund could reasonable expect to receive from the private investment fund if the funds interest were redeemed at the time of valuation determined based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the fund believes to be reliable unless determined otherwise in accordance with the funds procedures the fair value of the funds interest in a private investment fund shall be the value attributed to such interest as of that time of valuation as reported to the fund by the private investment funds manager administrator or other designed agent such a valuation may be a preliminary valuation and therefore may be later revised or adjusted by the private investment fund such adjustment or revision will have no affect on the funds net asset value as of any prior valuation time as a practical matter the adviser and the board have little or no means of independently verifying the valuations provided by such private investment funds as a result information available to the fund concerning the value of such investments may not reflect market prices or quotations for the underlying assets in the unlikely event that a private investment fund does not report a value to the fund on a timely basis and such fund is not priced by independent pricing agents of the fund the fund would determine the fair value of the private investment fund based on the most recent value reported by the private  sei structured credit fund lp notes to financial statements continued december    significant accounting policies continued valuation of investments continued investment fund as well as any other relevant information available at the time the fund values its portfolio the board will periodically review the funds valuation policies and will update them as necessary to reflect changes in the types of securities in which the fund invests fair value of financial instruments the fair value of the funds assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under statement of financial accounting standards no  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts presented on the statement of assets and liabilities management of the partnership deems these estimates reasonable income recognition and security transactions security transactions are recorded on the trade date costs used in determining net realized capital gains and losses on the sale of securities are on the basis of specific identification dividend income is recognized on the exdividend date and interest income is recognized using the accrual basis of accounting amortization and accretion is calculated using the scientific interest method which approximates the effective interest method over the holding period of the security amortization of premiums and discounts is included in interest income collateralized debt obligations the fund invests in cdos which include collateralized loan obligations clos and other similarly structured securities clos are a type of assetbacked securities a clo is a trust typically collateralized by a pool of loans which may include among others domestic and foreign senior secured loans senior unsecured loans and subordinate corporate loans including loans that may be rated below investment grade or equivalent  sei structured credit fund lp notes to financial statements continued december    significant accounting policies continued collateralized debt obligations continued unrated loans cdos may charge management fees and administrative expenses for cdos the cashflows from the trust are split into two or more portions called tranches varying in risk and yield the riskiest portion is the equity tranche which bears the bulk of defaults from the bonds or loans in the trust and serves to protect the other more senior tranches from default in all but the most severe circumstances since it is partially protected from defaults a senior tranche from a cdo trust typically has a higher rating and lower yield than their underlying securities and can be rated investment grade despite the protection from the equity tranche cdo tranches can experience substantial losses due to actual defaults increased sensitivity to defaults due to collateral default and disappearance of protecting tranches market anticipation of defaults as well as aversion to cdo securities as a class the risks of an investment in a cdo depend largely on the type of the collateral securities and the class of the cdo in which the fund invests normally clos and other cdos are privately offered and sold and thus are not registered under the securities laws as a result investments in cdos may be characterized by the fund as illiquid securities however an active dealer market may exist for cdos allowing a cdo to qualify for rule a transactions in addition to the normal risks associated with fixed income securities eg interest rate risk and default risk cdos carry additional risks including but are not limited to i the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments ii the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default iii the funds may invest in cdos that are subordinate to other classes and iv the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results federal taxes the funds taxable income or loss is reported by the limited partners individually the liability for payment of federal and state income tax on the funds earnings is the responsibility of its partners rather than that of the fund accordingly no provision on liability for us federal income taxes has been recorded in the financial statements  sei structured credit fund lp notes to financial

provided by simc to the fund and the resources of simc and its affiliates dedicated to the fund supported approval of the advisory agreement fund performance the board of directors considered the investment performance of other funds managed by simc in a style similar to that which had been proposed for the fund under the advisory agreement the other simc funds and how the performance of the

directors considered whether the varied levels of compensation and profitability under the advisory agreement and other service agreements were reasonable and justified in light of the quality of all services to be rendered to the fund by simc and its affiliates when considering the expected profitability of simc the board took into account the fact that the simc is compensated by the fund investors and not by the fund directly and such compensation with respect to simc reflects an armslength negotiation between the simc and the fund investors based on this evaluation the board concluded that within the context of its full deliberations the profitability of simc would be reasonable and supported approval of the advisory agreement economies of scale the directors considered the existence of any economies of scale and whether those would be passed along to the funds shareholders through a graduated investment advisory fee schedule or other means including any fee waivers

in an appropriate way knowledge of the timing and size of fund trades a potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers daytoday management of the fund because of their position with the fund the portfolio managers know the size timing and possible market impact of fund trades it is theoretically possible that the portfolio managers could use this information to the advantage of the other accounts and to the possible detriment of the fund however the adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time investment opportunities a potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers management of the fund and the other accounts which in theory may allow them to allocate investment opportunities in a way that favors the other accounts over the fund this conflict of interest may be exacerbated to the extent that the adviser or the portfolio managers receive or expect to receive greater compensation from their management of the other accounts than the fund notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest it is the advisers policy to manage each account based on its investment objectives and related restrictions and as discussed above the adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time and in a manner consistent with each accounts investment objectives and related restrictions for example while the portfolio managers may buy for an other account securities that differ in identity or quantity from securities bought for the fund such an approach might not be suitable for the fund given its investment objectives and related restrictions the adviser may enter into incentive fee arrangements with one or more investors in the sei structured credit segregated portfolio the offshore feeder fund a segregated portfolio of sei offshore advanced strategies series spc a segregated portfolio company established in the cayman islands that acts as a feeder fund for the fund whereby a portion of the increase in the net asset value of such investors investment in the offshore feeder fund over a given period shall be payable to the adviser this arrangement may create an incentive for the adviser to make investments for the fund that are riskier or more speculative than if the adviser had no such interest because the adviser will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation in the value of the offshore feeder funds assets if the value of its investment in the fund declines notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest it is the advisers policy to manage each account based on its investment objectives and

for the fund’s current fiscal year and include professional fees and other expenses including without limitation offering costs administration fees and custody fees   the adviser has voluntarily

of the registrant the fund a delaware limited partnership is registered under the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” as a closedend nondiversified management investment company  the fund was organized under delaware law on june    common units of limited partnership interest “shares” of the fund are being issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any “public offering” within the meaning of section  of andor regulation d under the securities act of  as amended the “securities act”  investments in the fund may be made only by “accredited investors” as defined in regulation d under the securities act and “qualified clients” as defined in rule  under the investment advisers act of  as amended the “advisers act”  this registration statement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any “security” within the meaning of the securities act  the fund may also from time to time issue a class of an unlimited number of preferred shares of the fund no par value   item  investment objective and policies the fund’s objective is to seek to generate high total returns  there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its objective except as expressly noted otherwise herein the fund’s investment objective policies and strategies may be changed without investor approval the fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a portfolio comprised of collateralized debt obligations “cdos” and other structured credit investments cdos involve special purpose investment vehicles formed to acquire and manage a pool of loans bonds andor other fixed income assets of various types the cdo funds its investments by issuing several classes of securities the repayment of which is linked to the performance of the underlying assets which serve as collateral for certain securities issued by the cdo  in addition to cdos the fund’s investments may include fixed income securities loan participations creditlinked notes medium term notes registered and unregistered investment companies or pooled investment vehicles and derivative instruments such as credit default swaps and total return swaps collectively with cdos “structured credit investments”  structured credit investments that are  themselves pooled investment vehicles are managed by third party managers “structured credit managers”  issuers of structured credit investments may by both domestic and foreign the fund offers investors the following potential advantages ·                  diversification through the spreading of risk across a number of structured credit investments collateral types underlying the structured credit investments and structured credit managers ·                  professional selection and evaluation of structured credit investments and the structured credit managers ·                  economies of scale in the form of optimal price execution and investment sourcing since structured credit investments generally require a minimum investment size that is higher than most individual investors would be willing or able to commit ·                  limited liability and ·                  administrative convenience the fund primarily invests in equity and mezzanine debt securities of cdos which may be rated as investment grade or below investment grade “high yield”  the securities issued by a cdo are tranched into rated and unrated classes the rating of each class is determined by among other things the priority of the claim on the cash flows generated by the underlying collateral of the cdo the senior notes issued by a cdo are typically rated “aaa” to “aa” and have the highest priority claim on cash flows  the mezzanine debt classes issued by a cdo are typically rated “a” to “b” and have a claim on the cash flows subordinate to that of the senior notes  since most of a cdo’s debt is highly rated it can raise the majority of its capital at a low cost in the debt markets relative to the yield earned on the underlying collateral purchased  the most junior tranche of a cdo called cdo equity is generally unrated  cdo equity investors receive payment from any residual interest proceeds or principal proceeds generated by the underlying collateral after payments of expenses and debt service with respect to the more senior tranches in the cdo’s structure  cdo equity can be considered a levered investment in the underlying collateral because the amount of the investment is significantly below the principal value of the cdo equity’s pro rata portion of the underlying collateral  however due to its subordinated nature cdo equity is the first tranche to absorb trading losses and defaults in the underlying collateral  therefore while the levered nature of cdo equity increases the cash flow that may be available for distribution it also increases the exposure to trading losses and defaults and accordingly causes returns to be more volatile  payments on cdo equity may be deferred or eliminated depending on the amount of cash flow generated by the collateral cdos may focus on different types of underlying collateral depending upon among other things market conditions and the relative attractiveness of the opportunities they present for arbitrage ie the difference between the yield on the collateral owned by a cdo and the funding cost of the debt issued by that cdo to help fund the purchase of the underlying collateral at any point in time  collateral held by a cdo may include loans to us or foreigndomiciled companies high yield bonds investment grade bonds mezzanine securities cdo debt hedge funds assetbacked securities commercial real estate trust preferred securities synthetic securities distressed debt convertible debt emerging markets securities or other fixed income assets except as otherwise stated in this prospectus or in the partnership agreement the investment objectives policies and restrictions of the fund are not fundamental and may be changed by the fund’s board of directors the “board”  the fund generally intends to provide prompt notice to investors of any material change to the investment objectives policies and restrictions of the fund  however the fund reserves the right not to do so where the board determines that doing so would not be in the best interests of the fund for instance due to  unusual or rapidly changing market conditions  in any event it is possible that investors will not be able to exit the fund before changes take effect the fund is an appropriate investment only for those investors who can tolerate a high degree of risk and do not require a liquid investment investment process a description of certain aspects of the current investment process can be found below however the investment process is flexible and will evolve on an ongoing basis and may diverge from this description in the future the investment process can be divided into five parts investment sourcing manager selection deal analysis portfolio construction and monitoring investment sourcing structured credit investments are sourced from both sellside underwriters and the structured credit managers or other parties associated with structured credit investments  the adviser has wellestablished relationships with the largest underwriters of structured finance securities who either verbally or electronically provide the adviser with a pipeline of upcoming offerings  underwriters are useful for introducing the adviser to firsttime or less well known structured credit managers  the adviser also has established relationships with a broad universe of structured credit managers either through past investments in structured finance investments or through the adviser’s other asset management activities  these managers have in the past notified the adviser of upcoming offerings prior to the offering appearing on the underwriter’s pipelines  a number of the more established managers will only allow access to their offerings to a select group of investors and these offerings therefore are not broadly offered to most investors  the fund’s investments will be sourced through both underwriters and structured credit managers to ensure access to the widest opportunity set of available investments structured credit manager selection the adviser believes that a key factor in analyzing most structured credit investments is an analysis of the structured credit manager  the skills required to manage or select a portfolio of collateral within a structured framework are critical to the performance of an investment  structured credit managers must understand and be able to evaluate opportunities in the underlying collateral  in addition the manager must be able to understand monitor and manage within the constraints imposed by the structure  the following are examples of the types of factors the adviser may consider in assessing structured credit managers ·                   a proven track record of managing or selecting the underlying collateral asset classes ·                   an understanding of managing assets within the constraints and limitations of a structured credit investment ·                   proven ability to receive favorable collateral allocations in the new issue market ·                   coinvestment by the structured credit manager in the structured credit investment when appropriate ·                   a strong culture of disciplined fundamental credit analysis ·                   investment professionals with broad depth and experience ·                   low turnover of key investment personnel ·                   experienced workout personnel ·                   robust administrative and support staff and systems  ·                   a direct relationship between the compensation of the portfolio management team and the performance of the structured credit investment the adviser will perform due diligence on all structured credit managers considered for inclusion in the portfolio and will use its network of industry contacts to perform additional reference checks on the management teams of each manager structural analysis there are significant structural nuances in structured credit investments that need to be understood and evaluated  these nuances can have a significant impact on the return performance of the various tranches  in evaluating a proposed portfolio investment the adviser will ·                   analyze the performance of the investment across a wide variety of scenarios ·                   analyze the structure of the cash flows ·                   understand all of the uses of cash structuring and placement fees legal fees rating agency fees at the time of deal closing ·                   evaluate rating agency requirements and credit rating methodologies ·                   analyze the collateral in terms of position level concentration credit quality distribution industry diversification and purchase price ·                   gain an understanding of the legal and tax implications of the transaction ·                   compare various collateral limitations minimum overcollateralization levels minimum interest coverage levels and reinvestment criteria with market conventions ·                   make recommendations concerning transaction structure to the underwriter in order to optimize the risk and return profile of each investment portfolio construction the portfolio construction process is designed to structure the fund’s portfolio in an attempt to meet its investment objective while staying in compliance with the fund’s investment limitations  the fund’s portfolio managers will assess market opportunities and conditions to form projections of expected risk and return for each available strategy  these projections are used to set target allocations  the efficiency at which target allocations are satisfied is a function of the availability of new investments in the primary market as well as liquidity in the secondary market monitoring portfolio monitoring occurs on an ongoing basis and includes routine contact with structured credit managers and portfoliolevel and securitylevel risk analysis  calls and visits to existing structured credit managers occur on a frequent basis to review their investment strategies their implementation of the investment strategies and their valuation methodologies   item  risk factors the purchase of shares in the fund involves a number of significant risks relating to investments in structured credit investments generally and to the structure and investment objective of the fund in particular  the value of an investment in the fund will change with the values of the fund’s investments  many factors can affect those values  in addition to the risk factors described below which are the  principal risk factors relating to the fund prospective investors should also consider the risks described elsewhere in this registration statement and the fund’s limited partnership agreement “partnership agreement” general considerations lack of operating history the fund has no operating history upon which investors can evaluate its past performance  there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective  although the adviser and its affiliates have managed other funds and are experienced in selecting structured credit investments and structured credit managers the past performance of other investment funds managed by the adviser or its affiliates should not be construed as an indication of the future performance of an investment in the fund no market for shares illiquidity pursuant to the partnership agreement shares are not transferable without the prior written consent of the board which the board may withhold in its sole discretion  the fund does not intend to list shares for trading on any national securities exchange  there is no secondary market for shares and none is expected to develop by subscribing for shares an investor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the fund the board the administrator as defined herein the adviser and each other investor or any director officer partner member employee agent representative or affiliate of any of the foregoing from and against any and all loss damage or liability due to or arising out of a transfer made by the investor of such investor’s shares in violation of the partnership agreement or a misrepresentation made by such investor in connection with any such transfer no investor will have the right to require the fund to redeem the shares or to exchange the investor’s shares for interests in any other fund  liquidity will be provided only through repurchase offers made from time to time by the fund in the complete discretion of the board  the first such repurchase offer is not expected to take place until at least two years after the fund commences operation  further investors whose initial investment in the fund was made less than two years prior to a repurchase offer must agree not to respond to such offer  even after the initial two year period it is possible that there will be extended periods during which illiquidity in the underlying investments held by the fund or other factors will cause the board to elect not to conduct repurchase offers  such periods may coincide with periods of negative performance  in addition even in the event of a repurchase offer it is possible that there will be an oversubscription to the repurchase offer in which case an investor may not be able to redeem the full amount that the investor wishes to redeem  an investment in the fund is therefore suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with the very limited liquidity of shares and should be viewed as a longterm investment limited right to vote and no right to participate in management of the fund investors will have no right or power to take part in the management or control of the fund and will have extremely limited rights to vote on matters in respect of the fund  investors will not receive the detailed financial information that is available to the adviser  accordingly no person should purchase shares in the fund unless such person is willing to entrust all aspects of the fund’s management to the board and the adviser  reliance on management the fund invests substantially all of its assets in a broad universe of structured credit investments  investment decisions will be made for the fund by the adviser under the supervision of the board  the success of the fund will depend on the ability of the adviser to identify suitable investments  there can be no assurance that the current personnel of the adviser will continue to be associated with the adviser for any length of time  the loss of the services of one or more employees of the adviser could have an adverse impact on the fund’s ability to realize its investment objective changes to investment objectives policies and restrictions the investment objectives of the fund are nonfundamental and may be changed by the board  except as otherwise stated in this registration statement or in the partnership agreement the investment policies and restrictions of the fund are not fundamental and may be changed by the board  the fund generally intends to provide prompt notice to investors of any material change to the investment objectives policies and restrictions of the fund  however the fund reserves the right not to do so where the board determines that doing so would not be in the best interests of the fund for instance due to unusual or rapidly changing market conditions  in any event it is possible that investors will not be able to exit the fund before changes take effect borrowings the fund may borrow on a shortterm basis to facilitate cash management or to cover operating expenses  if the fund borrows to finance repurchases of its shares interest on that borrowing will negatively affect investors who do not have all of their shares repurchased by the fund by increasing the fund’s expenses and reducing any net investment income  in addition to the extent that the fund borrows funds the rates at which it can borrow may affect the operating results of the fund the fund may leverage its investments in structured credit investments  although leverage presents opportunities for increasing total investment return it has the effect of potentially increasing losses as well  any event that adversely affects the value of the fund’s investments either directly or indirectly would be magnified to the extent that leverage is employed  the cumulative effect of the use of leverage directly or indirectly in a market that moves adversely to the investments of the entity employing the leverage would result in a loss that would be greater than if leverage were not employed borrowings by the fund are subject to a  asset coverage requirement under the  act  borrowings by certain structured credit investments will not be subject to this requirement  see “risk factors—investment risks—special investment instruments and techniques—leverage interest rates margin” investment risks failure to achieve investment objective there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective  the adviser’s assessment of the shortterm or longterm prospects of various structured credit investments may not prove accurate  no assurance can be given that any investment or trading strategy implemented by those structured credit investments in which the fund invests will be successful  furthermore because of the speculative nature of the investments and trading strategies of certain of the structured credit investments there is a risk that the fund may suffer a significant or complete loss of its invested capital in one or more  structured credit investments and that consequently investors may suffer a significant or complete loss of their invested capital in the fund general economic and market conditions the success of the fund’s investment program may be affected by general economic and market conditions such as interest rates availability of credit inflation rates economic uncertainty changes in laws and national and international political circumstances  these factors may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity of investments held by the fund and the structured credit investments  unexpected volatility or illiquidity could impair the fund’s profitability or result in losses highly volatile markets the prices of derivative instruments including swaps futures and options can be highly volatile  price movements of swaps forward futures and other derivative contracts in which the fund’s assets may be invested are influenced by among other things interest rates changing supply and demand relationships trade fiscal monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments and national and international political and economic events and policies  in addition governments from time to time intervene directly and by regulation in certain markets particularly those in currencies financial instruments futures and options  such intervention often is intended directly to influence prices and may together with other factors cause all of such markets to move rapidly in the same direction because of among other things interest rate fluctuations  securities or commodities exchanges typically have the right to suspend or limit trading in any instrument traded on the exchanges  a suspension could render it impossible for the adviser or the structured credit manager to liquidate positions and could thereby expose the fund to losses strategy risk the fund is subject to strategy risk  strategy risk is associated with the failure or deterioration of an entire strategy such that most or all structured credit managers in the strategy suffer significant losses  strategy specific losses can result from excessive concentration by structured credit managers in the same investment or broad events that adversely affect particular strategies eg illiquidity within a given market  many of the strategies employed by the structured credit managers are speculative and involve substantial risk of loss risks of securities activities all securities investing and trading activities involve the risk of loss of capital  while the adviser will attempt to manage these risks there can be no assurance that the fund’s investment activities will be successful or that investors will not suffer losses  the following discussion sets forth some of the more significant risks associated with the styles of investing of the fund and the underlying structured credit investments investments in collateralized debt obligations  the cdo investments purchased by the fund will generally represent the most junior part and in some cases may also represent one or more higher ranking tranches of the capital structure of the cdo and will not be rated by any rating agency or if rated will be rated below investment grade consequently the cdo investments will be subject to the greatest risk of loss will be the first part of the capital structure of the cdo to incur losses and will be directly affected by any losses or delays in payment on the related collateral the fund will invest in cdos that are managed by various managers and in some cdos with underlying collateral consisting of static pools selected by the related manager the  performance of any particular cdo will depend among other things on the level of defaults experienced on the related collateral as well as the timing of such defaults and the timing and amount of any recoveries on such defaulted collateral and except in the case of static pool cdos the impact of any trading of the related collateral  there can be no assurances that any level of investment return will be achieved by investors  it is possible that the fund’s investments in the cdos will result in a loss on an aggregate basis even if some investments do not suffer a loss and therefore investors could incur a loss on their investment  because the payments on the fund’s cdo investments are subordinated to payments on the senior obligations of the respective cdo the investments represent subordinated leveraged investments in the underlying collateral  therefore changes in the value of the fund’s cdo investments are anticipated to be greater than the change in the market value of the underlying collateral which themselves are subject to among other things credit liquidity and interest rate risk  moreover the fund’s cdo investments will have different degrees of leverage based on the capital structure of the cdo investors should consider with particular care the risks of the leverage present in fund’s investments because although the use of leverage by a cdo creates an opportunity for substantial returns on the related investment the subordination of such investment to the senior debt securities issued by that cdo increases substantially the likelihood that the fund could lose its entire investment in such investment if the underlying collateral is adversely affected by among other things the occurrence of defaults illiquid investments  the fund and structured credit managers may invest in securities that are subject to legal or other restrictions on transfer or for which no liquid market exists  the market prices if any for such securities tend to be volatile and the fund and collateral managers may not be able to sell them when it desires to do so or to realize what it perceives to be their fair value in the event of a sale  the sale of restricted and illiquid securities often requires more time and results in higher brokerage charges or dealer discounts and other selling expenses than does the sale of securities eligible for trading on national securities exchanges or in the overthecounter markets  restricted securities may sell at prices that are lower than similar securities that are not subject to restrictions on resale loan participations and assignments  the fund and structured credit managers may purchase loan participations and assignments loan participations are interests in loans to corporations or governments which are administered by the lending bank or agent for a syndicate of lending banks and sold by the lending bank financial institution or syndicate member “intermediary bank”  in a loan participation the borrower will be deemed to be the issuer of the participation interest except to the extent the fund or the structured credit investment derives its rights from the intermediary bank  because the intermediary bank does not guarantee a loan participation in any way a loan participation is subject to the credit risks generally associated with the underlying borrower  in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the borrower a loan participation may be subject to certain defenses that can be asserted by such borrower as a result of improper conduct by the intermediary bank  in addition in the event the underlying borrower fails to pay principal and interest when due the fund or the structured credit investment may be subject to delays expenses and risks that are greater than those that would have been involved if the fund or the structured credit investment had purchased a direct obligation of such borrower  under the terms of a loan participation the fund and the structured credit investment may be regarded as a creditor of the intermediary bank rather than of the underlying borrower so that the fund and the structured credit investment may also be subject to the risk that the intermediary bank may become insolvent loan assignments are investments in assignments of all or a portion of certain loans from third parties  when the fund or the structured credit investment purchases assignments from lenders  it will acquire direct rights against the borrower on the loan  since assignments are arranged through private negotiations between potential assignees and assignors however the rights and obligations acquired by the fund and the structured credit investment may differ from and be more limited than those held by the assigning lender  loan participations and assignments may be illiquid investments which are subject to the risk described above fixedincome securities  the fund and structured credit managers may invest in fixedincome securities which are obligations of the issuer to make payments of principal andor interest on future dates and include among other securities  bonds notes and debentures issued by corporations debt securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities or by a foreign government municipal securities and mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities  these securities may pay fixed variable or floating rates of interest and may include zero coupon obligations  fixedincome securities are subject to the risk of the issuer’s inability to meet principal and interest payments on its obligations ie credit risk and are subject to price volatility due to such factors as interest rate sensitivity market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity ie market risk the fund and structured credit managers may invest in both investment grade and noninvestment grade debt securities  investment grade debt securities are securities that have received a rating from at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization “nrsro” in one of the four highest rating categories or if not rated by any nrsro have been determined to be of comparable quality  noninvestment grade debt securities commonly referred to as “junk bonds” are securities that have received a rating from a nrsro of below investment grade or have been given no rating and are considered by the nrsro to be predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal  noninvestment grade debt securities in the lowest rating categories may involve a substantial risk of default or may be in default  noninvestment grade debt securities generally offer a higher yield than available from investment grade issues but involve greater risk  the returns of noninvestment grade debt securities are also subject to  i adverse changes in general economic conditions ii changes in the financial condition of their issuers iii changes in interest rates and iv changes in market liquidity  during periods of economic downturns or rising interest rates issuers of securities rated below investment grade or comparable unrated securities may experience financial stress that could adversely affect their ability to make payments of principal and interest and increase the possibility of default  in addition the market for lower grade debt securities may be thinner and less active than for higher grade debt securities  noninvestment grade debt securities have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities nonus investments  it is expected that the fund and the structured credit investments may invest in securities of nonus companies and foreign countries  investing in these securities involves certain considerations not usually associated with investing in securities of us companies or the us government including political and economic considerations such as greater risks of expropriation and nationalization confiscatory taxation the potential difficulty of repatriating funds general social political and economic instability and adverse diplomatic developments the possibility of imposition of withholding or other taxes on dividends interest capital gain or other income see item  the small size of the securities markets in such countries and the low volume of trading resulting in potential lack of liquidity and in price volatility fluctuations in the rate of exchange between currencies and costs associated with currency conversion and certain government policies that may restrict the fund’s and the structured credit investments’ investment opportunities  in addition accounting and financial reporting standards that prevail in foreign countries generally are not equivalent to united states  standards and consequently less information is available to investors in companies located in such countries than is available to investors in companies located in the united states  moreover an issuer of securities may be domiciled or may operate in a country other than the country in whose currency the instrument is denominated thereby increasing the possibility of an adverse impact from currency changes  the values and relative yields of investments in the securities markets of different countries and their associated risks are expected to change independently of each other  there is also less regulation generally of the securities markets in foreign countries than there is in the united states  in addition unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect the us dollar values of securities denominated in foreign currencies or traded in nonus markets  the adviser and the structured credit investment collateral managers may but are not required to hedge against such risk and there is no assurance that any attempted hedge will be successful special investment instruments and techniques the fund and the structured credit investments may utilize a variety of special investment instruments and techniques to hedge the portfolios of the fund and the structured credit investments against various risks such as changes in interest rates or other factors that affect security values or for nonhedging purposes to pursue the fund’s and the structured credit investments’ respective investment objective  certain of the special investment instruments and techniques that the fund and the structured credit investments may use are speculative and involve a high degree of risk particularly in the context of nonhedging transactions  consistent with cftc regulations the fund has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” under the commodity exchange act and therefore is not subject to registration or regulation as a pool operator under the commodity exchange act derivatives  derivatives are securities and other instruments the value or return of which is based on the performance of an underlying asset index interest rate or other investment  derivatives may be volatile and involve various risks depending upon the derivative and its function in a portfolio  special risks may apply to instruments that are invested in by the fund and the structured credit investments in the future that cannot be determined at this time or until such instruments are developed or invested in by the fund and the structured credit investments  certain swaps options and other derivative instruments may be subject to various types of risks including market risk the risk of lack of correlation liquidity risk the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty including risks relating to the financial soundness and creditworthiness of the counterparty legal risk and operations risk hedging transactions  the adviser and structured credit managers may but are not obligated to utilize a variety of financial instruments such as derivatives options credit default swaps interest rate swaps caps and floors futures and forward contracts to seek to hedge against declines in the values of their portfolio positions as a result of changes in currency exchange rates certain changes in the relevant markets and market interest rates and other events  hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of the hedged portfolio positions should increase  it may not be possible for the adviser and structured credit managers to hedge against a change or event at a price sufficient to protect the fund’s or a structured credit investment’s assets from the decline in value of the portfolio positions anticipated as a result of such change  in addition it may not be possible to hedge against certain changes or events at all  while the adviser and structured credit managers may enter into such transactions to seek to reduce particular risks unintended or unexpected events may result in a poorer overall performance for the fund than if the adviser or the structured credit managers had not engaged in any such hedging transaction  in addition the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio position being  hedged may vary  moreover for a variety of reasons the adviser and the structured credit managers may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged  such imperfect correlation may prevent the adviser and the structured credit managers from achieving the intended hedge or expose the fund or the structured credit investments to additional risk of loss  although the adviser and the structured credit managers may have the flexibility to engage in these transactions they may choose not to do so options and futures  the fund or a structured credit manager may utilize options contracts futures contracts and options on futures contracts  it also may use socalled “synthetic” options or other derivative instruments written by brokerdealers or other financial intermediaries  options transactions may be effected on securities exchanges or in the overthecounter market  when options are purchased overthecounter the fund’s or structured credit investment’s portfolio bears the risk that the counterparty that wrote the option will be unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the option contract  such options may also be illiquid and in such cases the fund or structured credit investment may have difficulty closing out its position  overthecounter options purchased and sold by the fund or structured credit investments also may include options on baskets of specific securities the fund or a structured credit investment may purchase call and put options on specific securities and may write and sell covered or uncovered call and put options for hedging purposes and nonhedging purposes to pursue its investment objective  a put option gives the purchaser of the option the right to sell and obligates the writer to buy the underlying security at a stated exercise price at any time prior to the expiration of the option  similarly a call option gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and obligates the writer to sell the underlying security at a stated exercise price at any time prior to the expiration of the option  a covered call option is a call option with respect to which the fund or a structured credit investment owns the underlying security  the sale of such an option exposes the fund or structured credit investment during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or to possible continued holding of a security that might otherwise have been sold to protect against depreciation in the market price of the security  a covered put option is a put option with respect to which cash or liquid securities have been placed in a segregated account on the fund’s or a structured credit investment’s books or with the fund’s or structured credit investment’s custodian or prime broker or similar arrangement to fulfill the obligation undertaken  the sale of such an option exposes the fund or a structured credit investment during the term of the option to a decline in price of the underlying security while depriving the fund or structured credit investment of the opportunity to invest the segregated assets the fund or a structured credit investment may close out a position when writing options by purchasing an option on the same security with the same exercise price and expiration date as the option that it has previously written on the security  the fund or a structured credit investment will realize a profit or loss if the amount paid to purchase an option is less or more as the case may be than the amount received from the sale thereof  to close out a position as a purchaser of an option the fund or a structured credit investment would ordinarily make a similar “closing sale transaction” which involves liquidating its position by selling the option previously purchased although the fund or structured credit investment would be entitled to exercise the option should it deem it advantageous to do so the fund or a structured credit investment may enter into stock futures contracts interest rate futures contracts and currency futures contracts in us domestic markets or on exchanges located outside the united states  foreign markets may offer advantages such as trading  opportunities or arbitrage possibilities not available in the united states  foreign markets however may have greater risk potential than domestic markets  for example some foreign exchanges are principal markets so that no common clearing facility exists and an investor may look only to the broker for performance of the contract  in addition any profits the fund or a structured credit investment might realize in trading could be eliminated by adverse changes in the exchange rate or the fund or a structured credit investment could incur losses as a result of those changes  transactions on foreign exchanges may include both commodities which are traded on domestic exchanges and those which are not  unlike trading on domestic commodity exchanges trading on foreign commodity exchanges is not regulated by the cftc engaging in these transactions involves risk of loss to the fund or a structured credit investment that could adversely affect the value of the fund’s net assets  no assurance can be given that a liquid market will exist for any particular futures contract at any particular time  many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day  once the daily limit has been reached in a particular contract no trades may be made that day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified periods during the trading day  futures contract prices could move to the limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and potentially subjecting the fund or a structured credit investment to substantial losses which may result in losses to the fund successful use of futures also is subject to the ability to predict correctly movements in the direction of the relevant market and to the extent the transaction is entered into for hedging purposes to ascertain the appropriate correlation between the transaction being hedged and the price movements of the futures contract the prices of commodities contracts and all derivative instruments including futures and options prices are highly volatile  price movements of forward contracts futures contracts and other derivative contracts in which the fund or a structured credit investment may invest are influenced by among other things interest rates changing supply and demand relationships trade fiscal monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments and national and international political and economic events and policies  in addition governments from time to time intervene directly and by regulation in certain markets particularly those for currencies and interest rate related futures and options  such intervention often is intended directly to influence prices and may together with other factors cause all of such markets to move rapidly in the same direction because of among other things interest rate fluctuations  the fund or a structured credit investment also is subject to the risk of the failure of any of the exchanges on which their positions trade or of their clearinghouses an interest rate future obligates the fund or a structured credit investment to purchase or sell an amount of a specific debt security at a future date at a specific price  a currency future obligates the fund or a structured credit investment to purchase or sell an amount of a specific currency at a future date at a specific price swaps  the fund or a structured credit investment may enter into interest rate index currency rate credit default and total return swap agreements  these transactions are entered into in an attempt to obtain a particular return when it is considered desirable to do so possibly at a lower cost than if the fund or a structured credit investment had invested directly in the asset that yielded the desired return  swap agreements are twoparty contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than a year  in a standard swap transaction two parties agree to exchange the returns or differentials in rates of return  earned or realized on particular predetermined investments or instruments which may be adjusted for an interest factor  the gross returns to be exchanged or “swapped” between the parties are generally calculated with respect to a “notional amount” ie the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate in a particular foreign currency or in a “basket” of securities representing a particular index interest rate swaps  the fund or a structured credit investment may enter into interest rate swaps  forms of swap agreements include interest rate caps under which in return for a premium one party agrees to make payments to the other to the extent interest rates exceed a specified rate or “cap” interest rate floors under which in return for a premium one party agrees to make payments to the other to the extent interest rates fall below a specified level or “floor” and interest rate collars under which a party sells a cap and purchases a floor or vice versa in an attempt to protect itself against interest rate movements exceeding given minimum or maximum levels currency swaps  the fund or a structured credit investment may enter into currency swaps for both hedging and nonhedging purposes  currency swaps involve the exchange of rights to make or receive payments in specified foreign currencies  since currency swaps are individually negotiated the fund or a structured credit investment would expect to achieve an acceptable degree of correlation between its portfolio investments and their currency swap positions  currency swaps usually involve the delivery of the entire principal value of one designated currency in exchange for another designated currency  therefore the entire principal value of a currency swap is subject to the risk that the other party to the swap will default on its contractual delivery obligations  the use of currency swaps is a highly specialized activity which involves special investment techniques and risks  if the adviser or a structured credit manager is incorrect in its forecasts of market values and currency exchange rates the fund’s or the structured credit investment’s performance will be adversely affected  if there is a default by the other party to such a transaction the fund or a structured credit investment will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction total return swaps  the fund or a structured credit investment may invest in total return swaps with appropriate counterparties  in a total return swap one party pays a rate of interest in exchange for the total rate of return on another investment  for example if the fund or a structured credit investment wished to invest in a senior loan it could instead enter into a total return swap and receive the total return of the senior loan less the “funding cost” which would be a floating interest rate payment to the counterparty certain swap agreements into which the fund or a structured credit investment enters may require the calculation of the obligations of the parties to the agreements on a “net basis”  consequently the fund’s or a structured credit investment’s current obligations or rights under such swap agreements generally will be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values of the positions held by each party to the agreement the “net amount”  the risk of loss with respect to swaps is limited to the net amount of interest payments that the fund or a structured credit investment is contractually obligated to make  if the other party to a swap defaults the fund’s or the structured credit investment’s risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the fund or the structured credit investment contractually is entitled to receive credit default swaps  the fund or a structured credit investment may enter into credit default swaps as a buyer or a seller a credit default swap is designed to transfer the credit exposure of a fixed income security between parties  the buyer in a credit default contract is obligated to pay  the seller a periodic stream of payments over the term of the contract provided no event of default with respect to the referenced instrument has occurred if an event of default occurs with respect to the referenced instrument the seller must pay the buyer the full notional value “par value” of the referenced instrument in exchange for the referenced instrument  if the fund or a structured credit investment is a buyer and no event of default occurs the fund or the structured credit investment will have made a stream of payments to the seller without having benefited from the default protection it purchased  however if an event of default occurs the fund or a structured credit investment as buyer will receive the full notional value of the referenced instrument that may have little or no value following default  as a seller the fund or a structured credit investment receives a fixed rate of income throughout the term of the contract provided there is no default  if an event of default occurs the fund or a structured credit investment would be obligated to pay the notional value of the referenced instrument in return for the receipt of the referenced instrument  the value of the referenced instrument received by the fund or a structured credit investment coupled with the periodic payments previously received may be less than the full notional value it pays to the buyer resulting in a loss of value to the fund or a structured credit investment  credit default swaps involve different risks than if the fund or a structured credit investment invests in the referenced instrument directly counterparty credit risk  many of the markets in which the fund and the structured credit investments effect their transactions are “overthecounter” or “interdealer” markets  the participants in these markets are typically not subject to credit evaluation and regulatory oversight as are members of “exchange based” markets  to the extent the fund or a structured credit investment invests in swaps derivative or synthetic instruments or other overthecounter transactions it is assuming a credit risk with regard to parties with whom it trades and may also bear the risk of settlement default  these risks may differ materially from those associated with transactions effected on an exchange which generally are backed by clearing organization guarantees daily markingtomarket and settlement and segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to intermediaries  transactions entered into directly between two counterparties generally do not benefit from such protections  this exposes the fund and the structured credit investments to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract whether or not bona fide or because of a credit or liquidity problem thus causing the fund and the structured credit investments to suffer a loss  such counterparty risk is accentuated in the case of contracts with longer maturities where events may intervene to prevent settlement or where the fund or the structured credit investment has concentrated its transactions with a single or small group of counterparties  some structured credit investments are not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty  the ability of the fund and the structured credit investments to transact business with any one or number of counterparties the lack of any independent evaluation of such counterparties’ financial capabilities and the absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses by the fund leverage interest rates margin  the fund and certain structured credit investments are permitted to borrow money and otherwise leverage their portfolios  the fund and certain structured credit investments may also “leverage” by using options swaps forwards and other derivative instruments  although leverage presents opportunities for increasing total investment return it has the effect of potentially increasing losses as well  any event that adversely affects the value of an investment either directly or indirectly by the fund or a structured credit investment would be magnified to the extent that leverage is employed  the cumulative effect of the use of leverage directly or indirectly in a market that moves adversely to the investments of the entity employing the leverage would result in a loss that would be greater than if leverage  were not employed  because of the relatively small intrinsic profits in “hedge” positions or in “arbitrage” positions the fund and some structured credit managers may use leverage to acquire extremely large positions in an effort to meet their rate of return objectives  consequently they will be subject to major losses in the event that market disruptions destroy the hedged nature of such positions  in addition to the extent that the fund and the structured credit investments borrow funds the rates at which they can borrow may affect the operating results of the fund  borrowings by the fund will be subject in aggregate to a  asset coverage requirement under the  act however borrowings by some structured credit investments are not subject to this requirement in general the anticipated use of shortterm margin borrowings by some structured credit investments results in certain additional risks  for example should the securities that are pledged to brokers to secure margin accounts decline in value or should brokers from which the fund or the structured credit investments have borrowed increase their maintenance margin requirements ie reduce the percentage of a position that can be financed then the structured credit investment could be subject to a “margin call” pursuant to which they must either deposit additional funds with the broker or suffer mandatory liquidation of the pledged securities to compensate for the decline in value  in the event of a precipitous drop in the value of the assets of a structured credit investment it might not be able to liquidate assets quickly enough to pay off the margin debt and might suffer mandatory liquidation of positions in a declining market at relatively low prices thereby incurring substantial losses  for these reasons the use of borrowings for investment purposes is considered a speculative investment practice  see “risk factors—general considerations—borrowings” for information concerning borrowing by the fund and the structured credit investments money market instruments  the fund may invest during periods of adverse market or economic conditions for defensive purposes some or all of their assets in high quality money market instruments and other shortterm obligations money market mutual funds or repurchase agreements with banks or brokerdealers or may hold cash or cash equivalents in such amounts as the fund’s adviser deems appropriate under the circumstances  the fund also may invest in these instruments for liquidity purposes pending allocation of their respective offering proceeds and other circumstances  money market instruments are high quality shortterm fixedincome obligations which generally have remaining maturities of one year or less and may include us government securities commercial paper certificates of deposit and bankers’ acceptances issued by domestic branches of united states banks that are members of the federal deposit insurance corporation and repurchase agreements repurchase agreements  repurchase agreements are agreements under which the fund purchases securities from a bank that is a member of the federal reserve system a foreign bank or a securities dealer that agrees to repurchase the securities from the fund at a higher price on a designated future date  if the seller under a repurchase agreement becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to repurchase the securities the fund would have the right to sell the securities  this right however may be restricted or the value of the securities may decline before the securities can be liquidated  in the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the securities before the repurchase of the securities under a repurchase agreement is accomplished the fund might encounter a delay and incur costs including a decline in the value of the securities before being able to sell the securities  repurchase agreements that are subject to foreign law may not enjoy protections comparable to those provided to certain repurchase agreements under us bankruptcy law and they therefore may involve greater risks  distressed credits  a structured credit manager may invest in securities of domestic and foreign issuers in weak financial condition experiencing poor operating results having substantial capital needs or negative net worth facing special competitive or product obsolescence problems or that are involved in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings  investments of this type may involve substantial financial and business risks that can result in substantial or at times even total losses  among the risks inherent in investments in troubled entities is the fact that it frequently may be difficult to obtain information as to the true condition of such issuers  such investments also may be adversely affected by state and federal laws relating to among other things fraudulent transfers and other voidable transfers or payments lender liability and the power of the bankruptcy court to disallow reduce subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims  the market prices of such securities are also subject to abrupt and erratic market movements and aboveaverage price volatility and the spread between the bid and asked prices of such securities may be greater than those prevailing in other securities markets  it may take a number of years for the market price of such securities to reflect their intrinsic value  in liquidation both in and out of bankruptcy and other forms of corporate reorganization there exists the risk that the reorganization either will be unsuccessful due to for example failure to obtain requisite approvals will be delayed for example until various liabilities actual or contingent have been satisfied or will result in a distribution of cash or a new security the value of which will be less than the purchase price to the structured credit investment of the security in respect to which such distribution was made lack of operating history of certain structured credit investments certain structured credit investments in which the fund invests may be newly formed entities that have no operating histories  therefore the adviser will not be able to evaluate the past performance of such investment limitations of prior performance whenever possible the adviser will evaluate the past investment performance of structured credit managers and their personnel  however this past investment performance may not be indicative of the future results of an investment in the structured credit investment managed by such manager  furthermore structured credit managers trading methods are dynamic and change over time thus a manager will not always use the same trading method in the future that was used to compile past performance histories reliance on the adviser the fund’s investment program should be evaluated on the basis that there can be no assurance that the adviser’s assessments of structured credit investments and structured credit managers and in turn its assessments of the shortterm or longterm prospects of investments will prove accurate  thus the fund may not achieve its investment objective and the fund’s net asset value may decrease  concentration of investments the fund invests substantially all of its assets in structured credit investments  however various factors including prevailing market conditions available investment opportunities the amount of investable assets and the timing of investments may prevent the adviser from investing the fund’s assets in as many structured credit investments as the adviser might otherwise prefer also the adviser cannot guarantee that the structured credit investments will not be concentrated  structured credit investments may target or concentrate their investments in particular markets sectors or industries  as a result of any such concentration of investments the portfolios of such structured credit investments are subject to greater volatility than if they had nonconcentrated portfolios  those structured credit investments that concentrate in a specific industry or target a specific sector will also be subject to the risks of that industry or sector which may include but not be limited to rapid obsolescence of technology sensitivity to regulatory changes minimal barriers to entry and sensitivity to overall market swings the fund may also be subject to the risk of concentration from individual investment decisions made by the adviser and the various structured credit managers to invest in the same security industry or sector thereby increasing the fund’s exposure to such security industry or sector for these and other reasons the fund could potentially be concentrated in relatively few structured credit investments and thus the benefits of diversification may not be realized  one risk of having a limited number of investments is that the aggregate returns realized by the investors may be substantially adversely affected by the unfavorable performance of a small number of such investments  the portfolio of the fund may therefore be subject to greater risk than the portfolio of a similar fund that does not concentrate its investments to the same extent lack of control over structured credit investments the fund may have no right or power to take part in the management or control of structured credit investments and only limited rights if any to vote on matters in respect of structured credit investments  to the extent the fund’s holdings in a structured credit investment afford it no ability to vote on matters relating to the structured credit investment the fund will have no say in matters that could adversely affect the fund’s investment in the structured credit investment  structured credit investments may be permitted to distribute securities in kind to investors including the fund and any such securities may be illiquid or difficult to value  in such circumstances the adviser may seek to dispose of these securities in a manner that is in the best interests of the fund however investors may receive inkind distributions of such securities in connection with the repurchase of shares by the fund or the liquidation of the fund or otherwise financing arrangements as a general matter the banks and dealers that provide financing to some structured credit investments have considerable discretion in setting and changing their margin haircut financing and collateral valuation policies  changes by banks and dealers in any of the foregoing policies may result in large margin calls loss of financing and forced liquidations of positions at disadvantageous prices  there can be no assurance that any particular structured credit investment will be able to secure or maintain adequate financing without which an investment in such structured credit investment may not be a viable investment  special risks of multitiered investments structured credit investments in which the fund invests generally will not be registered as investment companies under the  act and therefore the fund will not have the benefit of various protections afforded by the  act with respect to its investments in structured credit investments  for example registered investment companies are subject to various custody and safekeeping provisions designed to protect the companies’ assets  structured credit investments are not subject to these provisions and may be subject to a greater risk of loss associated with a failed custody relationship including as a result of misconduct by a structured credit manager  when the adviser invests the fund’s assets with a structured credit investment the fund does not have custody of the assets or control over their investment  therefore there is a risk that the structured credit manager could divert or abscond with the assets fail to follow agreed upon investment strategies provide false reports of operations or engage in other misconduct  the structured credit managers with whom the adviser invests the fund’s assets may be private and have not registered their securities or investment advisory operations under federal or state securities laws  this lack of registration with the attendant lack of regulatory oversight may enhance the risk of misconduct by the structured credit managers although the adviser expects to receive detailed information from each structured credit manager regarding its investment performance and investment strategy on a regular basis the adviser may have limited access to the specific underlying holdings of the structured credit investment and little ability to independently verify the information that is provided by the structured credit manager  a structured credit manager may use proprietary investment strategies that are not fully disclosed to the adviser which may involve risks under some market conditions that are not anticipated by the adviser  at any given time the adviser may not know the composition of a structured credit investment’s portfolio with respect to the degree of hedged or directional positions the extent of concentration risk or exposure to specific markets or collateral types  in addition the adviser may not learn of significant structural changes such as personnel manager withdrawals or capital growth until after the fact by investing in structured credit investments indirectly through the fund investors bear fees at both the fund level and the structured credit investment level  performancebased fees at the structured credit investment level may create an incentive for a structured credit manager to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than if the structured credit manager had no such interest because the structured credit manager will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation in the value of the relevant structured credit investment’s assets if the value of the structured credit investment declines investors also bear a proportionate share of the other operating expenses of the fund including administrative expenses and indirectly similar expenses of the structured credit investments  an investor who meets the conditions imposed by the structured credit investments including investment minimums that may be considerably higher than the minimum imposed by the fund could invest directly with the structured credit investments and avoid paying fund expenses investment decisions of structured credit managers are made independently of each other  as a result at any particular time one structured credit manager may be purchasing securities of an issuer for a structured credit investment whose securities are being sold by another structured credit manager for another structured credit investment  in any such situations the fund could indirectly incur certain transaction costs without accomplishing any net investment result since the fund may be able to make investments in or effect withdrawals from structured credit investments only at certain times the fund from time to time may have to invest a greater portion of its assets temporarily in money market or other more liquid securities than it otherwise might wish to invest the fund may not be able to withdraw its investment in a structured credit investment promptly after it  has made a decision to do so and the fund may have to borrow money to enable the fund to tender for shares  this may adversely affect the fund’s investment return structured credit investments may be permitted to redeem their interests inkind  thus upon the fund’s withdrawal of all or a portion of its interest in a structured credit investment the fund may receive securities that are illiquid or difficult to value  in these circumstances the fund may seek to dispose of these securities in an appropriate manner the fund may agree to indemnify certain of the structured credit investments and structured credit managers from liability damage cost or expense arising out of among other things certain acts or omissions the structured credit investments may at any time and without notice to the fund change their investment objectives policies or strategies  this may adversely affect the fund’s allocation among investment strategies and may adversely affect the fund’s overall risk valuations by structured credit investment managers with respect to certain structured credit investments in particular private investment partnerships for which there is no trading market the value of the fund’s investment may be determined in accordance with valuation information provided by the structured credit manager  in such cases structured credit managers typically have discretion to determine whether market prices or quotations fairly represent the value of particular assets held by the structured credit investment and authorization to assign a value to such assets which differs from the market prices or quotations for such assets  as a result pricing information available to the fund from such structured credit investments and used by the fund for valuation purposes may not reflect market prices or quotations for the underlying assets held by such structured credit investment  certain securities in which such structured credit investments invest may not have readily ascertainable market prices  these securities may nevertheless generally be valued by structured credit managers even though they will generally face a conflict of interest in valuing such securities because the values given to the securities will affect the compensation of the managers neither the adviser nor the board will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of the valuations provided by certain of the structured credit managers  furthermore these valuations will typically be estimates only subject to revision based on the structured credit investment’s annual audit  such revisions whether increasing or decreasing the net asset value of the fund at the time they occur because they relate to information available only at the time of the revision will not affect the amount received from the fund by investors who tendered their shares and received all of their redemption proceeds prior to such adjustments  as a result to the extent that such subsequently adjusted valuations from the structured credit managers or revisions to net asset value of a structured credit investment adversely affect the net asset value of the fund the outstanding shares will be adversely affected by prior tenders to the benefit of investors who tendered their shares at a net asset value higher than the adjusted amount  conversely any increases in the net asset value resulting from such subsequently adjusted valuations will be entirely for the benefit of the outstanding shares and to the detriment of investors who previously tendered their shares at a net asset value lower than the adjusted amount  the same principles apply to the purchase of shares  new investors may be affected in a similar way  revisions to the gain and loss calculations of the fund will be an ongoing process and no appreciation or depreciation figure can be considered final until the annual audits of the fund are completed  shortterm and defensive investments the fund will invest its cash reserves in high quality shortterm investments  these investments may include money market instruments and other shortterm debt obligations money market mutual funds and repurchase agreements with banks and brokerdealers  during periods of adverse market or economic conditions the fund may temporarily invest all or a significant portion of its assets in these securities or hold cash  this could prevent the fund from achieving its investment objective certain tax risks there are a number of tax considerations with respect to an investment in the fund  investors should be aware that they will be taxed annually on their allocable shares of fund income and realized gains if any whether or not they receive any cash distributions under current law for taxable years beginning on or before december   the highest longterm capital gains rate applicable to individuals will be   however the fund and certain of the structured credit investments may engage in investment strategies that generate substantial amounts of shortterm capital gain and ordinary income that for individual taxpayers will be taxable at rates that are up to twenty percentage points higher than the more favorable longterm capital gains rate in addition an investor’s share of certain losses and expenses of the fund may be subject to limitations  in particular us tax regulations prohibit the deduction through partnerships of amounts which would not be deductible if paid by an individual  these limitations may apply to certain fees and expenses of the fund  such fees and expenses will be separately reported to investors and in the case of individuals and certain trusts and estates generally will be deductible only to the extent that such investor’s aggregate miscellaneous itemized deductions for the year exceed  of their adjusted gross income  see item  conflicts of interest other activities of the adviser  there may be numerous potential conflicts of interest between the adviser or its affiliates referred to collectively in this section as the “management parties” on the one hand and the fund on the other hand and between the fund and other investment pools and clients managed by the management parties including but not limited to their own accounts and the accounts of family members “other accounts”  certain investment opportunities may be appropriate for the fund and the management parties and for such other accounts  the management parties are not obligated to share any investment opportunity with the fund although it and those other accounts may invest in the opportunity  there may be circumstances under which the management parties will cause one or more other accounts to commit a larger percentage of their assets to an investment opportunity than the percentage of the fund’s assets they commit to such investment  under some circumstances if the management parties or other accounts have significant investments in an investment opportunity regulation may restrict the fund’s ability to participate in the investment opportunity  there also may be circumstances under which the management parties purchase or sell an investment for their other accounts and do not purchase or sell the same investment for the fund or purchase or sell an investment for the fund and do not purchase or sell the same investment for one or more other accounts  the management parties may have interests in other accounts they manage which differ from their interests in the fund and may manage such other accounts on terms that are more favorable to them than the terms on which they manage the fund  in addition the management parties may charge fees to other accounts and be entitled to receive performancebased incentive allocations from other accounts that are more favorable to the management  parties than the fees charged to the investors thereby creating a financial incentive to favor such other accounts further the adviser may enter into incentive fee arrangements with one or more investors in the sei structured credit segregated portfolio the “offshore feeder fund” a segregated portfolio of sei offshore advanced strategies series spc a segregated portfolio company established in the cayman islands that acts as a feeder fund for the fund whereby a portion of the increase in the net asset value of such investor’s investment in the offshore feeder fund over a given period shall be payable to the adviser  this arrangement may create an incentive for the adviser to make investments for the fund that are riskier or more speculative than if the adviser had no such interest because the adviser will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation in the value of the offshore feeder fund’s assets if the value of its investment in the fund declines subject to applicable regulatory limitations the fund may sell any of its investments to the management parties or a client of the management parties and the fund may purchase an investment made by the management parties or any such client  in addition to the extent permitted by applicable law the management parties in their sole discretion may from time to time take an active management role in one or more companies in which the fund invests directly or indirectly through the structured credit investments which may give rise to additional conflicts of interest  the fund may invest in companies or other entities in which the management parties including other clients of the management parties have an investment and the management parties and other clients of the management parties may invest in companies or other entities in which the fund has made an investment in certain instances the conflicts described in this section or the resolution thereof may have an adverse impact on the fund and its ability to achieve its investment objective  investors will have no right to be informed of such conflicts as they arise or to participate in the resolution of such conflicts other activities of structured credit managers  conflicts of interest may arise from the fact that the structured credit managers and their affiliates generally will be carrying on substantial investment activities for other clients including other investment funds in which the fund will have no interest  the structured credit managers may have financial incentives to favor certain of such accounts over the structured credit investment  any of their proprietary accounts and other customer accounts may compete with the structured credit investment for specific trades or may hold positions opposite to positions maintained on behalf of the structured credit investment  the structured credit manager may give advice and recommend securities to or buy or sell securities for a structured credit investment in which the fund has invested which advice or securities may differ from advice given to or securities recommended or bought or sold for other accounts and customers even though their investment objectives may be the same as or similar to those of the fund  structured credit managers and their principals officers employees and affiliates may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts and as a result may have actual or potential conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of the relevant structured credit investment  positions may be taken by principals officers employees and affiliates of a structured credit manager that are the same different or made at a different time than positions taken for the relevant structured credit investment  structured credit managers may invest directly or indirectly in the securities of companies affiliated with the management parties or in which the management parties have an equity or participation interest  the purchase holding and sale of such investments by a structured credit manager may enhance the profitability of the management parties’ own investments in such companies  conflict in valuation of investments  while pricing information generally is available for certain securities in which the fund or a structured credit investment may invest pricing information for other securities in which the fund or the structured credit investments may invest may not be available and reliable pricing information may at times not be available from any source  for purposes of calculating the fund’s net capital appreciation or depreciation which includes unrealized appreciation and depreciation valuation decisions will be made by the adviser in accordance with procedures approved by the board based upon such information as is available to them including information provided by structured credit managers and other sources conflicting interests of investors the fund is likely to have a diverse range of investors that may have conflicting interests that stem from differences in investment preferences tax status and regulatory status  the adviser will consider the objectives of the fund when making decisions with respect to the selection structuring and sale of securities including structured credit investments  it is inevitable however that such decisions may be more beneficial for one investor than for another investor as stated above the adviser may enter into incentive fee arrangements with one or more investors in the offshore feeder fund this arrangement may create an incentive for the adviser to make investments for the fund that are riskier or more speculative than if the adviser had no such interest because the adviser will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation in the value of the offshore feeder fund’s assets if the value of its investment in the fund declines notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest it is the adviser’s policy to manage each of its accounts based on such account’s investment objectives and related restrictions and the adviser believes that it has designed policies and procedures that are designed to manage such conflict in an appropriate way these activities and conflicts of interest are explicitly acknowledged and consented to by each investor as a necessary condition to such investor’s admission to the fund limits of risk disclosures the above discussion covers key risks associated with an investment in the fund but is not nor is it intended to be a complete enumeration

transfers of shares no right of redemption the fund is a closedend investment company and therefore no investor will have the right to require the fund to redeem its shares  no public market for shares exists and none is expected to develop in the future  consequently investors generally will not be able to liquidate their investment other than as a result of repurchases of their shares by the fund repurchase procedures the fund from time to time may offer to repurchase outstanding shares pursuant to written tenders by investors  repurchase offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the board in its sole discretion  in determining whether the fund should repurchase shares from investors pursuant to written tenders the board will consider the recommendations of the adviser  the fund does not intend to conduct any repurchase offers until two years after the commencement of the fund’s operation  after the initial two year period the adviser expects that it will recommend to the board that the fund offer to repurchase shares four times each year as of the last business day of march june september and december  however investors will not be permitted to tender for repurchase shares that were acquired less than two years prior to the effective date of the proposed repurchase the board will consider the following factors among others in making its determination to repurchase shares ·                  whether any investors have requested to tender shares to the fund ·                  the liquidity of the fund’s assets ·                  the investment plans and working capital requirements of the fund ·                  the relative economies of scale with respect to the size of the fund  ·                  the history of the fund in repurchasing shares and ·                  the economic condition of the securities markets the board will determine that the fund repurchase shares from investors pursuant to written tenders only on terms the board determines to be fair to the fund and its investors  when the board determines that the fund will make a repurchase offer notice of that offer will be provided to each investor describing the terms of the offer and containing information that investors should consider in deciding whether to tender shares for repurchase  investors who are deciding whether to tender their shares or portions thereof during the period that a repurchase offer is open may ascertain the estimated net asset value of their shares which is typically calculated once a month at the close of business on the last business day of each month from the administrator during the period the offer remains open repurchases of shares from investors by the fund may be paid in cash or by the distribution of securities inkind or partly in cash and partly inkind  however the fund does not expect to distribute securities inkind except in the unlikely event that making a cash payment would result in a material adverse effect to the fund or investors not tendering shares for repurchase  any inkind distribution of securities may consist of unmarketable securities valued pursuant to procedures approved by the board which will be distributed to all tendering investors on an equal basis to the extent practicable  investors may be unable to liquidate such securities in a timely manner may incur brokerage or other transaction costs in liquidating such securities and may receive a lower price upon liquidation of such securities than the value assigned to them by the fund at the time of distribution the fund does not presently intend to impose any charges in connection with repurchases of shares  however the fund may at the sole discretion of the board impose charges on investors whose shares are repurchased if a repurchase offer is oversubscribed by investors who tender shares the fund will repurchase only a pro rata portion of the shares tendered by each investor shares will be valued for purposes of determining their repurchase price generally  days after the date by which investors must submit a repurchase request although the fund may establish a shorter period from time to time the “valuation date”  an investor will thus continue to bear investment risk after such investor’s shares or a portion of its shares are tendered for repurchase and until the valuation date  payment for shares or portions thereof tendered and accepted for purchase by the fund may consist of a noninterestbearing nontransferable promissory note entitling an investor to the payment described below if an investor tenders its entire shares in the fund and the fund purchases those shares the investor will be entitled to i an initial payment equal to  of the unaudited net asset value of the shares tendered and purchased determined as of the valuation date the “initial payment” which will be paid to the investor unless the existence of changes in tax or other laws or regulations or unusual market conditions result in a delay within thirtyfive  days after the valuation date andii a contingent payment the “contingent payment” equal to the excess if any of a the net asset value of the shares tendered and purchased as of the valuation date as may or may not be adjusted based upon subsequent revisions to the net asset values of the structured credit investments if applicable over b the initial payment which will be payable promptly after completion of the fund’s next annual audit together with interest on the contingent payment at a money market instrument or similar rate to be determined by the board or the adviser or the board’s other designee in each case in such person’s absolute discretion  an investor whose partial tender of its shares is accepted for purchase by the fund will be entitled to payment of the unaudited net asset value of such shares determined as of the valuation date thirtyfive  days after the valuation date the fund may make multiple audit adjustments to repurchase payment amounts in the event that additional relevant information becomes available following the fund’s annual audit  the fund may but is not obligated to provide investors all or a portion of whose shares are being repurchased with evidence of the fund’s obligation to pay for such shares prior to the date or dates on which payment is made  although the fund has the option to pay all or a portion of the amount owed to tendering investors by distributing securities such amounts are expected to be paid entirely in cash under these procedures investors will have to decide whether to tender their shares for repurchase without the benefit of having current information regarding the value of shares as of a date proximate to the valuation date  repurchases will be effective after receipt and acceptance by the fund of all eligible written tenders of shares from investors an investor who tenders for repurchase only a portion of the investor’s shares will be required to maintain a minimum account balance in the fund as of the valuation date the precise amount of which will be established from time to time by the board and is currently   the requirement to maintain a minimum account balance when tendering a portion of an investor’s shares may be waived from time to time in the sole discretion of the board  if an investor tenders a portion of such investor’s shares and the repurchase of that portion would cause the value of the investor’s remaining shares to fall below the required minimum the fund reserves the right to reduce the portion of the shares to be purchased from the investor so that the required minimum is maintained forced repurchase the board may i cause the fund to repurchase shares or portion thereof of an investor or any person acquiring shares or portion thereof from or through an investor such repurchase being offered without the consent of or other action by the investor or other person or ii cause an investor to sell all or a portion of its shares to another investor or person such sale to take place without the consent of or other action by the investor in each case at the most recently

of the shares have been transferred without the adviser’s or the board’s approval or the shares or a portion of the shares has vested in any person other than by operation of law as the result of the death disability dissolution bankruptcy or incompetence of an investor ·                   ownership of shares or a portion of the shares by an investor or other person is likely to cause the fund to be in violation of or subject the fund to additional registration or regulation under the securities commodities or other laws of the united states or any other relevant jurisdiction or may subject the fund or any investor to an undue risk of adverse tax consequence such as the fund no longer being taxed as a partnership but rather as an association taxable as a corporation or other fiscal or regulatory consequences ·                   continued ownership of shares or a portion of the shares by the investor or other person may be harmful or injurious to the business of the fund the board

potential assignor or assignee unless the board or the adviser consults with counsel and counsel confirms that the transfer will not cause the fund to be treated as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation which confirmation shall be obtained at the expense of the transferor the board or the adviser generally may not consent to a transfer of shares unless the following conditions are met  i the transferring investor has been an investor of the fund for at least two years ii the proposed transfer is to be made on the effective date of an offer by the fund to repurchase shares and iii the transfer is a  one in which the tax basis of the shares in the hands of the transferee is expected to be determined in whole or in part by reference to its tax basis in the hands of the transferring investor eg gifts and contributions to family entities and  to members of the transferring investor’s immediate family siblings spouse parents or children or b a distribution from a qualified retirement plan or an individual retirement account unless otherwise waived by the board or the adviser in each such party’s sole discretion any transfer shall be made only upon the receipt by the fund of an opinion of counsel which opinion shall be obtained at the expense of the transferor and by counsel satisfactory to the adviser that the transfer will be made pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the securities act and applicable state securities laws and of an executed complete and satisfactory subscription agreement  an investor who transfers all or any portion of his shares in any manner may be charged reasonable expenses including attorneys’ and accountants’ fees incurred by the fund in connection with the transfer any transferee acquiring shares by operation of law as a result of the death disability dissolution bankruptcy or incompetence of an investor or otherwise will be entitled to i the allocations and distributions allocable to the shares so acquired ii to transfer all or any portion of the shares in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement and iii to tender all or any portion of the shares for repurchase by the fund  however the transferee will not be entitled to the other rights of an investor unless and until the transferee becomes a substituted investor as specified in the partnership agreement  if an investor transfers its shares with the approval of the board or the adviser the fund  will take all necessary actions so that each transferee or successor to whom the shares are transferred is admitted to the fund as a limited partner in subscribing for shares an investor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the fund the board the adviser each other investor and their affiliates against all losses claims damages liabilities costs and expenses including legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending against any losses claims damages liabilities costs and expenses or any judgments fines and amounts paid in settlement joint or several to which those persons may become subject by reason of or arising from any transfer made by that investor in violation of these provisions or any misrepresentation made by that investor in connection with any transfer voting the investors shall have power to vote only  i for the election of directors including the filling of any vacancies in the board of directors if required by the  act ii for the removal of directors to the extent and as provided in the partnership agreement iii with respect to any investment adviser if required by the  act including any exemptions therefrom iv with respect to the amendment of the partnership agreement as provided in the partnership agreement and v with respect to such additional matters relating to the fund as may be required by the partnership agreement the fund’s bylaws the  act and on such other matters as the board may consider necessary or desirable with respect to any matter the investors shall vote in proportion to their capital account balances as of the record date applicable to the consideration of such matter  there shall be no cumulative voting in the election of directors  the investors may vote in person or by proxy the partnership agreement provides that on any matter submitted to a vote of all investors all investors entitled to vote shall vote together  there will normally be no meetings of fund investors for the purpose of electing members of the board except that in accordance with the  act  i the fund will hold an investors’ meeting for the election of members of the board at such time as less than a majority of the members of the board holding office have been elected by investors of the fund and ii if as a result of a vacancy on the board less than twothirds of the members of the board holding office have been elected by the investors that vacancy may be filled only by a vote of the investors capital accounts and allocations the fund’s partnership agreement currently permits the board to admit investors as members of the fund from time to time provided they meet certain qualifications under federal and state securities laws  the fund will maintain a separate capital account for each of its investors  the opening balance of each investor’s capital account will be such investor’s initial investment in also referred to as a capital contribution to the fund  each investor’s capital account will be increased by additional capital contributions made by such investor and by allocations of net profits to such capital account and will be decreased by repurchases by the fund of such investor’s shares or portions thereof by distributions to such investor that are not reinvested and by allocations of net losses to such capital account  each investor’s capital account will be subject to further adjustment as described below allocation of net profits and net losses as of the last day of each fiscal period the fund shall allocate net profits or losses for that fiscal period to the capital accounts of all investors in proportion to their respective opening capital account balances for such fiscal period after taking into account any capital contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of such fiscal period  net profits or net losses for a given fiscal period are measured by the net change in the value of the net assets of the fund including any net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments and realized income and gains or losses and accrued expenses over such fiscal period after giving effect to any contributions made as of the first day of the fiscal period and before giving effect to any distributions and repurchases of shares or portions thereof by the fund as of the end of such fiscal period allocation of organizational expenses the fund will pay all organizational expenses of the fund  organizational expenses are not currently deductible but may be amortized for tax purposes by the fund over a period of not less than  years  syndication expenses are neither deductible nor amortizable tax obligations withholding taxes or other tax obligations incurred by the fund that are attributable to any investor will be debited against the capital account of that investor as of the close of the fiscal period during which the fund paid those obligations thereby reducing the amount distributable  to the investor  if the amount of those taxes is greater than the distributable amounts then the investor or its successor will be required to pay upon demand to the fund as a contribution to the capital of the fund the amount of the excess distributions the board in its sole discretion may authorize the fund to make distributions in cash or in kind at any time to all investors on a pro rata basis in accordance with each investor’s capital account balance  it is expected however that the fund will not regularly make any distributions to investors reserves appropriate reserves may be created accrued and charged against net assets and proportionately against the capital accounts of the investors for contingent liabilities as of the date the contingent liabilities become known to the fund  reserves will be in such amounts subject to increase or reduction that the fund may deem necessary or appropriate general information the fund’s fiscal year ends on december   the fund anticipates sending to investors an unaudited semiannual and an audited annual report within  days after the close of the period for which the report is being made or as otherwise required by the  act  any investor may request from the adviser an estimate based on unaudited data of the net asset value of the fund as of the end of any calendar month  the fund may also prepare and distribute periodic unaudited reports of the fund’s performance as deemed appropriate by the adviser the fund’s tax year ends on december   after the end of each tax year of the fund each investor will receive a partnership schedule k reporting the taxable items of income gain loss and deduction for the prior tax year  because schedules k for investors cannot be completed until the fund receives schedules k from all the structured credit investments that are structured as partnerships if any in which the fund invests the fund does not expect that investors will receive a schedule k prior to april   consequently investors should expect to request extensions of filing deadlines for their tax returns the board has selected ernst  young llp as the independent registered public accounting firm of the fund ernst  young llp’s principal business address is  market street philadelphia pennsylvania   ernst  young llp conducts an annual audit of the fund’s financial statements the law firm of morgan lewis  bockius llp  market street philadelphia pennsylvania  serves as legal counsel to the fund and the adviser  determination of net asset value the fund typically computes its net asset value as of the last business day of each month  generally the net asset value will be determined on such day as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange the “exchange” although foreign exchange rates and the value of certain securities the trading of which is substantially completed prior to the closing of the exchange may be computed as of an earlier time of day  the net asset value of the fund equals the value of the assets of the fund less all of its liabilities including accrued fees and expenses if available cdos and other structured credit investments will be priced based upon valuations provided by independent thirdparty pricing agents  such values generally reflect the last reported sales price if the security is actively traded  the thirdparty pricing agents may also value structured credit investments at an evaluated bid price by employing methodologies that utilize actual market transactions brokersupplied valuations or other methodologies designed to identify the market value for such securities  such methodologies generally consider such factors as security prices yields maturities call features ratings and developments relating to specific securities in arriving at valuations if a price for a cdo or other structured credit investment cannot be obtained from an independent thirdparty pricing agent the fund shall seek to obtain a bid price from at least one independent broker  in such cases it is possible that the independent broker providing the price on the cdo or structured credit investment is also a market maker and in many cases the only market maker with respect to that security securities listed on a securities exchange market or automated quotation system for which quotations are readily available other than securities traded on nasdaq are valued at the last quoted sale price on the primary exchange or market foreign or domestic on which the securities are traded or if there is no such reported sale at the most recent quoted bid price  the fund values securities traded on nasdaq at the nasdaq official closing price  the prices of foreign securities are reported in local currency and converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates  debt obligations with remaining maturities of sixty days or less may be valued at their amortized cost which approximates market value securities for which market prices are not “readily available” or may be unreliable are valued in accordance with fair value procedures established by the board the fund’s fair value procedures are implemented through a fair value committee the committee designated by the board  when a security is valued in accordance with the fair value procedures the committee will determine the value after taking into consideration relevant information reasonably available to the committee examples of factors the committee may consider are the facts giving rise to the need to fair value the last trade price the performance of the market or the issuer’s industry the liquidity of the security the size of the holding in the fund or any other appropriate information  the determination of a security’s fair value price often involves the consideration of a number of subjective factors and is therefore subject to the unavoidable risk that the value assigned to a security may be higher or lower than the security’s value would be if a reliable market quotation for the security was readily available certain structured credit investments may be structured as private investment partnerships  traditionally a trading market for holdings of this type does not exist  as a general matter the fair value of the fund’s interest in such a private investment fund will represent the amount that the fund could reasonably expect to receive from the private investment fund if the fund’s interest were redeemed at the time of valuation determined based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the fund believes to be reliable  unless determined otherwise in accordance with the fund’s procedures the fair value of the fund’s interest in a private investment fund shall be the value attributed  to such interest as of that time of valuation as reported to the fund by the private investment fund’s manager administrator or other designated agent  such a valuation may be a preliminary valuation and therefore may be later revised or adjusted by the private investment fund  such adjustment or revision will have no affect on the fund’s net asset value as of any prior valuation time  as a practical matter the adviser and the board have little or no means of independently verifying the valuations provided by such private investment funds  as a result information available to the fund concerning the value of such investments may not reflect market prices or quotations for the underlying assets  in the unlikely event that a private investment fund does not report a value to the fund on a timely basis and such fund is not priced by independent pricing agents of the fund the fund would determine the fair value of the private investment fund based on the most recent value reported by the private investment fund as well as any other relevant information available at the time the fund values its portfolio the board will periodically review its valuation policies and will update them as necessary to reflect changes in the types of securities in which the fund invests the adviser acts as investment adviser to other clients that may invest in securities for which no public market price exists  the adviser may use other acceptable methods of valuation in these contexts that may result in differences in the value ascribed to the same security owned by the fund and other clients  consequently the fees charged to the fund and other clients may be different since the method of calculating the fees takes the value of all assets including assets carried at different valuations into consideration prospective investors should be aware that situations involving uncertainties as to the value of portfolio positions could have an adverse effect on the net assets of the fund if the judgments of the board the adviser or structured credit managers should prove incorrect  also structured credit managers will only provide determinations of the net asset value of structured credit investments on a weekly or monthly basis and it will not be possible to determine the net asset value of the fund more frequently portfolio transactions it is the policy of the fund to obtain the best results in connection with effecting its portfolio transactions taking into account certain factors as set forth below  in most instances the fund purchases securities of structured credit investments and such purchases by the fund may be but are generally not subject to transaction expenses  nevertheless the fund anticipates that its other portfolio transactions will be subject to expenses the fund bears any commissions or spreads in connection with its portfolio transactions  in placing orders it is the policy of the fund to obtain the best results taking into account the brokerdealer’s general execution and operational facilities the type of transaction involved and other factors such as the brokerdealer’s risk in positioning the securities involved  while the adviser generally seeks reasonably competitive spreads or commissions the fund will not necessarily be paying the lowest spread or commission available  in executing portfolio transactions and selecting brokers or dealers the adviser seeks to obtain the best overall terms available for the fund  in assessing the best overall terms available for any transaction the adviser considers factors deemed relevant including the breadth of the market in the security the price of the security the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission if any both for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis  in evaluating the best overall terms available and in selecting the brokerdealer to execute a particular transaction the adviser may also consider the brokerage and research services provided as those terms are defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act”  consistent with any guidelines established by the board and section e of the exchange act the adviser is authorized to pay to a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and  research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the fund which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if but only if the adviser determines in good faith that such commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer viewed in terms of that particular transaction or in terms of the overall responsibilities of the adviser to its discretionary clients including the fund  in addition the adviser is authorized to allocate purchase and sale orders for securities to brokers or dealers that are affiliated with the adviser or the fund’s principal underwriter if the adviser believes that the quality of the transaction and the commission are comparable to what they would be with other qualified firms structured credit investments structured credit investments incur transaction expenses in the management of their portfolios which may decrease the value of the fund’s investment in the structured credit investments  in view of the fact that the investment program of certain of the structured credit investments may include trading as well as investments shortterm market considerations will frequently be involved and it is anticipated that the turnover rates of certain of the structured credit investments may be substantially greater than the turnover rates of other types of investment vehicles  in addition the order execution practices of the structured credit investments may not be transparent to the fund  each structured credit manager is responsible for placing orders for the execution of its portfolio transactions and for the allocation of its brokerage  the adviser has no direct or indirect control over the brokerage or portfolio trading policies employed by the structured credit managers  structured credit investments will not necessarily pay the lowest commission available on each transaction and may engage in transactions with brokerdealers based on different criteria than those that the fund would consider  structured credit investments may not be subject to the same regulatory restrictions as the fund on principal and agency transactions  the fund indirectly bears the commissions or spreads in connection with the portfolio transactions of the structured credit investments no guarantee or assurance can be made that a structured credit investment’s brokerage transaction practices will be transparent or that the structured credit investments will establish adhere to or comply with its stated practices  however as structured credit investments typically are not investment companies registered under the  act and their managers may not be registered investment advisers under the advisers act they may select brokers on a basis other than that outlined above and may receive benefits other than research or that benefit the structured credit investments’ managers or their affiliates rather than the structured credit investments summary of the limited partnership agreement an

of the state of delaware as permitted pursuant to section  of the drulpa and ii in connection with any such conversion any outstanding shares to be exchanged or converted into securities of or interests in the business form into which the fund is converted under or pursuant to any state or federal statute to the extent permitted by law upon completion of the merger or consolidation if the fund is the surviving or resulting entity the general partner shall file a certificate of merger or consolidation in accordance with section  of the drulpa item  not applicable item  not applicable item  tax considerations circular  notice  the following notice is based on us treasury regulations governing practice before the us internal revenue service  any us federal tax advice contained herein is not intended or written to be used and cannot be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding us federal tax penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer  any such advice is written to support the promotion or marketing of the transactions described herein and  each  taxpayer should seek advice based on the taxpayer’s particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor this discussion summarizes certain us federal income tax considerations for investors who are united states persons  the discussion is based upon the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” and upon judicial decisions us treasury regulations “regulations” internal revenue service “service” rulings and other administrative materials interpreting the code all of which are subject to change that may or may not be retroactive  the discussion does not purport to deal with all of the us federal income tax consequences applicable to the fund or to all categories of investors some of whom may be subject to special rules  the tax consequences of an investment in the fund will depend not only on the nature of the fund’s operations and the then applicable federal tax principles but also on certain factual determinations which cannot be made at this time and upon a particular investor’s individual circumstances  the fund has not sought a ruling from the service or any other federal state or local agency with respect to any tax issues affecting the fund nor has either fund obtained an opinion of counsel with respect to any tax issues investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of an investment in the fund in light of their particular circumstances including under laws of their residence or domicile and any other local state or federal laws publicly traded partnership status of the fund the fund believes that it will be classified and treated as a partnership rather than an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  the board has the authority to change this classification however a partnership that is not an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation will not itself be subject to federal income tax but rather each investor therein will be required to take into account for each taxable year its distributive share of items of partnership income gain loss and deduction substantially as though such items had been realized directly by the investor and without regard to whether any distribution by the partnership has been or will be received under the code “publicly traded partnerships” are generally taxable as corporations for federal income tax purposes  a publicly traded partnership is any partnership the interests in which are traded on an established securities market or which are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof  shares in the fund will not be traded on an established securities market  regulations concerning the classification of partnerships as publicly traded partnerships provide certain safe harbors under which interests in a partnership will not be considered readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof  it is expected that the fund will be eligible for one or more safe harbors set forth in the regulations  it is not anticipated that the fund will qualify under the private placement safe harbor set forth in the regulations if as is anticipated the fund has more than  investors if the fund does not technically fit within one or more of the safe harbors the regulations specifically provide that the fact that a partnership does not qualify for the safe harbors is disregarded for purposes of determining whether interests in a partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof  rather in this event the partnership’s status is examined under a general facts and circumstances test set forth in the regulations  the fund believes that under this “facts and circumstances” test and based on the operations of the fund as well as the legislative history to section  and the text of the regulations shares in the fund should not be treated as readily tradable on a  secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and therefore the fund should not be classified as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation if it were determined that the fund is an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a result of a changes in the code the regulations or judicial interpretations thereof a change in facts or otherwise the taxable income of the fund would be subject to corporate income tax when recognized by the fund distributions of such income other than in certain redemptions of fund interests would be treated as dividend income when received by investors to the extent of the fund’s current or accumulated earnings and profits and investors would not be entitled to report profits or losses realized by the fund  the balance of this discussion of tax considerations assumes that the fund will be classified as a partnership and not as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation tax treatment of the fund unless otherwise indicated references in the discussion below to the tax consequences of fund investments activities income gain and loss include the direct investments activities income gain and loss of the fund and those indirectly attributable to the fund as a result of it being a member of an underlying structured credit vehicle as an entity treated as a partnership for tax purposes the fund will not itself be subject to federal income tax but each investor in the fund will be required to take into account in computing its us federal income tax liability for each taxable year its distributive share of items of fund income gain loss and deduction substantially as though such items had been realized directly by such investor and without regard to whether any distribution by the fund has been or will be received  the amount of tax due if any with respect to gains and income of the fund is determined separately for each investor  following the close of the fund’s taxable year and the receipt of relevant tax information from the structured credit vehicle the fund will provide each investor with a schedule k indicating the investor’s distributive share of the fund’s income gain loss and deduction  each investor is responsible for keeping his or her own records for determining such investor’s tax basis in its shares and reporting any gain or loss from the disposition of such shares investors in the fund may be subject to state local and foreign taxes and filing requirements in jurisdictions in which the fund acquires interests in structured credit vehicles and in the case of structured credit vehicle that are passthrough entities for these purposes “passthrough funds” the jurisdictions in which such structured credit vehicle directly or indirectly invest or operate  investors should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific federal state local and nonus tax consequences of the purchase and ownership of a share in the fund tax allocations allocations of taxable income gain loss deductions and credits of the fund will be made in accordance with the economics of the fund as determined in the discretion of the adviser  the adviser is authorized to interpret and apply and if necessary vary the tax allocation provisions so as to comply with code sections  and  and applicable regulations  the adviser has the discretion to make special allocations including allocations of ordinary income or shortterm capital gain or loss for federal income tax purposes to a withdrawing investor to the extent that there is a difference between its capital account and its federal income tax basis determined without regard to any adjustments made to such “adjusted tax basis” by reason of any transfer or assignment of such interest including by reason of death in its interests  there can be no assurance however that the service will accept the fund’s allocations  if the  allocation methods used by the fund were not respected for us federal income tax purposes an investor could be required to recognize more or less taxable income than the investor was allocated tax determinations and elections the adviser is authorized to make on behalf of the fund all tax determinations and elections in its sole discretion  certain of these elections could result in items of income gain loss deduction and credit being treated differently for tax and accounting purposes  the adviser will decide how to report the fund items on the tax returns of the fund and all investors are required under the code to treat the items consistently on their own returns unless they file a statement with the service disclosing the inconsistency under section  of the code the fund has the option to make an election to adjust the basis of the fund’s assets in the event of a distribution of fund property to an investor or a transfer of a fund interest  this optional adjustment could either increase or decrease the value of a fund interest to the transferee depending on the relevant facts because the election under section  would increase or decrease the basis of the fund’s assets for the purpose of computing the transferee’s distributive share of fund income gains deductions and losses  the fund must make this adjustment  on a transfer of a fund interest if immediately following the transfer the adjusted tax basis of the fund’s property exceeds its fair market value by more than  or  on a distribution of property if the adjustment results in a basis reduction of the fund’s remaining assets of more than  there can be no assurance that the advisor will make the optional election under code section  because  once made the election cannot be revoked without obtaining the service’s consent  the election may not be advantageous to all investors and  accounting complexities result from having the election in effect in the event the income tax return of the fund is audited by the service the tax treatment of the fund’s income and deductions generally is determined at the fund level in a single proceeding rather than by individual audits of the investors  the board shall designate a “tax matters partner” of the fund and such tax matters partner shall have considerable authority to make decisions affecting the tax treatment and procedural rights of the investors  in addition the tax matters partner shall have the authority to bind certain investors to settlement agreements and the right on behalf of all investors of the fund to extend the statute of limitations relating to the investors’ tax liabilities with respect to fund items  in determining how to report the fund’s tax items on its tax returns the adviser will rely on certain tax determinations made by the underlying structured credit vehicle tax consequences to a withdrawing investor an investor receiving cash from the fund in connection with the investor’s complete withdrawal from the fund will generally recognize capital gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received by such investor and such investor’s adjusted tax basis in its shares  in general any gain or loss realized upon a withdrawal will be treated as longterm capital gain or loss if all of the interest has been held as a capital asset for more than  months  otherwise such capital gain or loss will be shortterm  however an investor will recognize ordinary income to the extent such investor’s allocable share of “unrealized receivables” including any accrued but untaxed market discount exceeds the investor’s share of the basis in those unrealized receivables  an investor receiving a cash nonliquidating distribution eg in connection with a repurchase of a portion of the investor’s shares will recognize gain and income in a similar manner but only to the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds such investor’s adjusted tax basis of its shares  if an investor acquires portions of his or her shares at different times or acquires its entire interest in a single transaction resulting in different holding periods under the code such investor’s shares generally will have a divided holding period which could cause such investor to recognize more or less shortterm and longterm capital gain or loss than it would have recognized if its shares had a single holding period  an investor generally determines the portion of its shares to which a holding period relates based on the fraction the numerator of which is equal to the fair market value of the portion of the shares received in the transaction to which the holding period relates and the denominator of which is the fair market value of its entire shares determined immediately after the transaction  if an investor’s shares have a divided holding period any capital gain or loss that such investor recognizes as a result of a distribution from the fund will be divided between longterm and shortterm capital gain or loss in the same proportion that the holding period is divided between the portion of the shares held for more than one year and the portion of the shares held for one year or less as described in the previous sentence as indicated above the adviser has the discretion to make a special allocation of income or loss for federal income tax purposes to a withdrawing investor to the extent there is a difference between its liquidating distribution and its federal income tax basis in its interests  such an allocation may result in a withdrawing investor recognizing more ordinary income and less longterm capital gain than the investor would otherwise have recognized an investor’s receipt of a distribution of property from a partnership is generally not taxable  however the tax law generally requires a partner in a partnership to recognize gain on a distribution by the partnership of marketable securities to the extent that the value of such securities exceeds the partner’s adjusted basis in its partnership interest  this requirement does not apply however to distributions to “eligible partners” of an “investment partnership” as those terms are defined in the code  the adviser intends to operate the fund so that it will qualify as an “investment partnership” although there can be no assurance that it will be successful in this regard  if the fund qualifies as an investment partnership each investor should qualify as an “eligible partner” provided that such investor contributes only cash and certain other liquid property to the fund  special rules apply to the distribution of property to an investor who contributed other property to the fund and to the distribution of such contributed property to another investor  investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax treatment of distributions and redemption proceeds including the tax treatment of distributions of assets in kind character and timing of income the fund’s income and gains if any may consist of ordinary income shortterm capital gains andor longterm capital gains  accordingly investors should not expect that any portion of any taxable income of the fund will necessarily consist of longterm capital gains taxable at reduced rates although some or all of the taxable losses if any realized by the fund in a taxable year may consist of longterm capital losses the deductibility of which is subject to certain limitations  the investment strategies of the fund and passthrough funds including certain investments and hedging transactions may result in the fund and the passthrough funds being subject to special tax rules including code section  relating to nonus currency transactions “short sale” rules “straddle” rules mixed straddle rules code section  relating generally to marking to market of certain futures and other contracts conversion transaction rules and code section  constructive sale rules that defer taxable losses or accelerate taxable income cause investors to be taxed on amounts not representing economic income cause adjustments in the holding periods of securities convert longterm capital gains into shortterm capital gains or ordinary income or convert shortterm capital losses into longterm capital losses the fund may indirectly gain exposure to a structured credit vehicle by the fund’s purchase of a structured note swap or other contract  as a result the fund could bear a greater tax burden with respect to such instruments than it would bear if it were investing directly in a structured credit vehicle  alternatively the fund may be treated as engaging in a constructive ownership transaction  if the fund has longterm capital gain from a constructive ownership transaction the amount of the gain that may be treated as longterm capital gain by the fund is limited to the amount that the fund would have recognized if it had been holding the financial asset directly rather than through a constructive ownership transaction with any gain in excess of this amount being treated as ordinary income  in addition an interest charge is imposed with respect to any amount recharacterized as ordinary income on the underpayment of tax for each year that the constructive ownership was open effect of straddle rules and wash sales on investors’ securities positions the service may treat certain positions in securities held directly or indirectly by an investor and its indirect interest in similar securities held by reason of its investment in the fund as “straddles” for us federal income tax purposes  the application of the “straddle” rules in such a case could affect an investor’s holding period for the securities involved and may defer the recognition of losses with respect to such securities  application of the “wash sales” rules to the transactions of the fund or passthrough funds would cause all or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of securities held directly or indirectly by an investor to be disallowed if substantially identical securities are purchased within  days before or after the disposition  in such a case the basis of the newlypurchased securities will be adjusted to reflect the loss special considerations for taxexempt investors under current us federal income tax law income tax is imposed on the unrelated business taxable income as defined in code section  “ubti” of taxexempt investors subject to the tax  in addition a certain portion of income derived from debtfinanced property is required to be included in ubti  it is expected that the fund may use leverage  the use of leverage may generate ubti for taxexempt investors  accordingly any such investors are directed to consult with their tax advisors and to consider an investment in the fund through sei structured credit segregated portfolio a segregated portfolio of sei offshore advanced strategies series spc a segregated portfolio company established in the cayman islands that acts as a feeder fund for the fund  if ubti is produced by the fund an entity that is exempt from federal tax but is subject to tax on its ubti and that is a direct investor in the fund would be required to report as taxable income its pro rata share of any portion of the fund’s income that is considered ubti  an investment in the fund may be especially inappropriate for a charitable remainder trust because the receipt of ubti is subject to a  excise tax on such trust’s ubti for each taxable year beginning after december   investors should consult with their own tax advisors concerning the possible effects of ubti on their own tax situations as well as the general tax implications of an investment in the fund potential limitations on the use of losses and the deductibility of expenses the fund is not expected to be engaged in activities to which the “passive activity loss” provisions of the code would apply  as a result an investor’s share of any losses from the fund is not expected to be subject to disallowance under the passive activity loss limitations  on the other hand an investor that is subject to the passive activity loss provisions is not expected to be able to offset its share of income and gain from the fund against any losses that are subject to the passive activity loss limitations  accordingly an investor subject to the passive activity loss provisions should not invest in the fund with the expectation of offsetting such investor’s share of income and gain from the fund against losses derived from passive activities  certain expenses of the fund are expected to be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions of the fund for us federal income tax purposes  for us federal income tax purposes individuals and certain trusts or estates that hold interests directly or through a partnership subchapter s corporation or grantor trust may deduct such expenses in a taxable year only to the extent that their aggregate miscellaneous itemized deductions for the year exceed  of their adjusted gross incomes for the year  in addition in the case of individuals whose adjusted gross income exceeds a certain inflationadjusted threshold the aggregate itemized deductions allowable for the year will be reduced by the lesser of i  of the excess of adjusted gross income over the applicable threshold or ii  of the aggregate itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the taxable year determined after giving effect to the  limitation described above and any other applicable limitations  the us treasury department has issued regulations prohibiting the deduction through partnerships of amounts which would be nondeductible if paid by an individual  these limitations may apply to certain fees and expenses of the fund  the amounts of these fees and expenses will be separately reported to the investors and as indicated above will be deductible by an individual investor to the extent that the investor’s miscellaneous deductions exceed  of the investor’s adjusted gross income but only if the investor itemizes deductions  the  limitation on itemized deductions will be gradually reduced until december   after which time it will no longer apply  the legislation will expire and this limitation on deductions will return to pre levels after december   unless congress enacts tax legislation providing otherwise  in the unlikely event the fund is deemed to be a trader in securities the  and  limitations will not apply interest on amounts borrowed to acquire or carry investment assets which may include all or part of an investor’s share of the fund’s interest expense andor interest on debt incurred to make an investment in the fund is expected to be investment interest and therefore is expected to be deductible only to the extent of the investor’s investment income withholding the fund directly or indirectly through its investments in other funds may make investments in countries outside the us  it is possible that such investments could cause some of the income or gains of the fund to be subject to withholding or other taxes of nonus jurisdictions especially if the fund were considered to be conducting a trade or business in the applicable country through a permanent establishment  such foreign taxes may be reduced or eliminated by applicable income tax treaties  the fund will inform investors of their proportionate share of the foreign taxes paid or incurred by the fund that investors will be required to include in their income  some investors may not be eligible for certain or any treaty benefits  subject to certain limitations for us federal income tax purposes an investor through its investment in the fund may be entitled to claim a credit for its allocable share of any nonus tax incurred by the fund including withholding taxes so long as such nonus tax qualifies as a creditable income tax under the applicable regulations  alternatively an investor may elect to deduct its share of such nonus taxes for us federal income tax purposes “phantom” income from certain foreign equity investments certain nonus investments of passthrough funds including investments in “controlled foreign corporations” and “passive foreign investment companies” may cause an investor to recognize taxable income prior to the fund’s receipt of distributable proceeds pay an interest charge on receipts that are deemed as having been deferred or recognize ordinary income that otherwise would have been treated as capital gain  in addition certain of these investments may require investors to file special tax forms  investments in passive foreign investment companies the fund may make investments into structured credit vehicles that are not passthrough funds but are instead treated as foreign corporations for us tax purposes  such nonus corporations may be classified as “passive foreign investment companies” “pfics”  in general a nonus corporation is classified as a pfic if  or more of its gross income constitutes “passive income” – generally interest dividends royalties rent and similar income and gains on the disposition of “passive” assets generally those that generate such income – or  or more of its assets are held for the production of passive income  under the pfic rules gain attributable to a disposition of pfic stock as well as income attributable to certain “excess distributions” with respect to that pfic stock is allocated ratably over the shareholder’s holding period for the stock  gain allocated under this rule to i the year in which the shareholder disposes of the pfic stock and ii any year prior to the time the nonus corporation first satisfied the pfic earnings or asset tests as well as income attributable to any excess distribution on pfic stock allocated to those years is subject to tax as ordinary income at the us federal income tax rate applicable to the shareholder for the year in which the disposition occurs  disposition gain attributable to years included in the shareholder’s holding period – other than those described in the preceding clauses i and ii – and income attributable to excess distributions allocated to each such other year is subject to tax as ordinary income at the maximum us federal income tax rate applicable to the shareholder for the year in which the income is treated as realized and also to an interestlike charge on the shareholder’s “deferred” payment of this tax liability that accrues generally from the year of deemed realization through the due date of the shareholder’s us federal income tax return for the year of the disposition or distribution  a us investor will be treated as a us shareholder with respect to its proportionate share of any pfic stock owned by the fund  if however that pfic is also a “controlled foreign corporation” in which the us investor is a “united states shareholder” as defined below the pfic rules generally are superseded by the rules discussed below dealing with controlled foreign corporations the pfic rules are highly technical and it is possible that a nonus corporation in which the fund makes an investment will be classified as a pfic  if the fund does invest in a pfic and that company agrees to provide certain information the fund may elect to treat that company as a “qualifying electing fund” “qef” or if the fund does not do so a us investor may make such election  if the fund makes a qef election such election is applicable to all of its partners  a us shareholder that holds stock of a nonus corporation with respect to which a qef election has been made for the first taxable year in the us shareholder’s holding period for which the nonus corporation is a pfic will be subject to tax currently on its proportionate share of certain earnings and net capital gain of the nonus corporation – regardless of whether that corporation actually distributes cash or other property to the fund but generally will not be subject to the tax regime described above  although recent tax legislation has reduced the rate of tax imposed on certain dividends to  this rate reduction does not apply to dividends paid or deemed paid by pfics  alternatively if such pfic stock is publicly traded the us shareholder may treat any resulting gain or loss as ordinary income or loss to avoid pfic tax  a qef election generally will not result in current inclusion of the pfic’s earnings for any year in which the pfic has no net ordinary earnings and no net capital gain  as noted above the pfic rules including the rules pertaining to qef elections generally should not affect taxexempt us investors the fund cannot predict with any certainty at this time whether any of its investments may be subject to the pfic regime nor can it predict the effects of any applicable elections made by a us investor  it is possible that us investors may be subject to tax currently under the pfic regime on their proportionate shares of certain earnings of a nonus corporation in which the fund holds an interest andor may incur penalty taxes without receiving from the fund distributions sufficient to satisfy any associated tax liability  investments in controlled foreign corporations special rules apply to united states persons who own directly or indirectly and applying certain attribution rules  or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a nonus corporation each a “united states shareholder” that is a “controlled foreign corporation” “cfc”  for this purpose the fund as a us partnership may be treated as a united states shareholder  complex indirect ownership and attribution rules apply in making these determinations  a nonus corporation generally will be a cfc if united states shareholders collectively own more than  of the total combined voting power or total value of the corporation’s stock on any day during any taxable year united states shareholders of a cfc generally must include in their gross income for us federal income tax purposes their pro rata shares of certain earnings and profits of the cfc  further if a us person sells or exchanges stock in a nonus corporation and that person is or was a united states shareholder at any time during the fiveyear period ending on the date of such sale or exchange during which that nonus corporation was a cfc that united states person generally will be required to treat a portion of the gain recognized upon such sale or exchange as a dividend to the extent of the earnings and profits of the cfc attributable to such shares  accordingly if the fund is a united states shareholder in a cfc the us investors in the fund  may be required to report and pay tax currently on their proportionate shares of the cfc’s earnings and profits attributable to them through the fund that are taxable to the united states shareholders currently under the cfc rules and  may be subject to the recharacterization rules described above  in addition the sale by a taxable us investor of an interest in the fund may result in the recognition by such investor of income equal to its distributive share of the same character of income ie ordinary dividend income that would have been triggered if the fund sold its interest in the cfc at fair market value  income of a cfc subject to income tax in a country other than the united states at an effective rate greater than  if the maximum us corporate income tax rate is not taxable to a united states shareholder as income taxable under subpart f of the code if the united states shareholder so elects the rules applicable to cfcs and pfics are complex and the foregoing summary of the us federal income taxation of us investors owning an indirect interest in a cfc or a fphc is general in nature the fund cannot provide any assurance that it will not make investments in cfcs or pfics  the cfc and pfic rules however generally should not affect taxexempt us investors in the fund us foreign tax credits subject to applicable limitations on foreign tax credits a us investor that is subject to us federal income taxation may be entitled to elect to treat withholding and other nonus taxes as foreign income taxes eligible for credit against such investor’s us federal income tax liability  similarly each such us investor’s share of any nonus taxes which may be imposed on capital gains or other income realized by the fund generally should be treated as creditable foreign income taxes  capital gains realized by the fund however may be considered to be from sources within the us which may effectively limit the amount of foreign tax credit allowed to a us investor  other complex limitations also may apply which may result in reductions in the amount or the elimination of foreign tax credits otherwise allowable to a us investor with respect to its share of income of the fund  because of these limitations us investors may be unable to claim a credit for the full amount of their proportionate shares of any nonus taxes paid by the fund  us investors that do not elect to treat their shares of foreign withholding and gains taxes as creditable generally may claim a deduction against us taxable income for such taxes  however since the availability of a credit or deduction depends on the particular circumstances of each us investor such investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors  certain reporting requirements with respect to nonus investments an investor may be subject to certain reporting requirements that may require such investor to file information returns with the service with respect to certain transfers of cash or property by the fund to a nonus partnership  the investor will be relieved of these reporting requirements if the fund reports the transfer  the fund intends to report such transfers an investor also may be required to report certain transfers by the fund to a nonus corporation if in general such investor’s proportionate share of the investment held through the fund as well as directly or by attribution exceed certain thresholds  under current regulations this reporting must be made by the fund’s investors and may not be satisfied by the fund  in addition an investor that acquires directly or indirectly through the fund  by vote or value of the stock of a nonus corporation must report certain acquisitions or dispositions of or proportional changes of its interest in the nonus corporation  it is not expected that an investor’s indirect interest in a fund investment in a nonus corporation will equal  of the voting power of the nonus corporation by reason of the fund’s share of such an investment  the fund has not committed to provide information about the fund’s investments that may be needed to complete any reporting requirements  investors are urged to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to these reporting requirements us tax shelter rules the fund may engage in transactions or make investments that would subject the fund its investors that are obliged to file us tax returns andor its advisers to special rules requiring such transactions or investments by the fund or investments in the fund to be reported andor otherwise disclosed to the service including to the service’s office of tax shelter analysis the “tax shelter rules”  a transaction may be subject to reporting or disclosure if it is described in any of several categories of transactions which include among others transactions that result in the incurrence of a loss or losses exceeding certain thresholds including foreign currency losses that result in large tax credits from assets held for  days or less that are offered under conditions of confidentiality  although the fund does not expect to engage in transactions solely or principally for the purpose of achieving a particular tax consequence there can be no assurance that the fund will not engage in transactions that trigger the tax shelter rules  in addition an investor may have disclosure obligations with respect to its interest in the fund if the investor or the fund in certain cases participates in a reportable transaction  investors should consult their own tax advisors about their obligation to report or disclose to the service information about their investment in the fund and participation in the fund’s income gain loss or deduction with respect to transactions or investments subject to these rules  in addition pursuant to these rules the fund may provide to its advisers identifying information about the fund’s investors and their participation in the fund and the fund’s income gain loss or deduction from those transactions or investments and the fund or its advisers may disclose this information to the service upon its request  significant penalties may apply for failure to comply with these rules no tax benefits expected because it is expected that an investment in the fund will not reduce the cumulative tax liability of an investor in any year as a result of tax losses deductions or credits prospective investors should not invest with the expectation of receiving any such tax benefits state and local taxes and filing requirements an investor of the fund may be subject to tax return filing obligations and income franchise and other taxes in jurisdictions in which the fund operates as well as in such investor’s own state or locality of residence or domicile  in addition the fund itself may be subject to tax liability in certain jurisdictions in  which it operates and an investor may be subject to tax treatment in such investor’s own state or locality of residence or domicile different from that described above with respect to its investment in the fund certain tax considerations for nonus investors it is not currently expected that the fund will be offered to nonus investors  an investment in the fund by a nonresident alien foreign corporation foreign partnership foreign estate or foreign trust may subject such nonus investors to us federal state and local income taxation on such investment and may require such nonus investors to file us federal state and local income tax returns summary laws subject to change the preceding discussion is intended as a summary of certain us federal income tax consequences of an investment in the fund  because many of these consequences will vary from one investor to another the summary does not address all of the provisions of the code that might be applicable to a particular investor  moreover changes in applicable tax laws after the date of this registration statement may alter anticipated tax consequences  neither the adviser the fund nor any of their counsel or consultants assume any responsibility for the tax consequences to any investor of an investment in the fund prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors with specific reference to their own tax situations and potential changes in the tax laws applicable to an investment in the fund certain erisa considerations persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an employee benefit plan subject to the employee retirement income security act of  as amended “erisa” “erisa plan” should consider among other things the duties and responsibilities that erisa imposes on such fiduciaries before determining whether to invest in the fund  also fiduciaries of an individual retirement account “ira” a keogh plan or other “plan” described in section e of the code that is not otherwise subject to title i of erisa “taxqualified plan” should consider among other things that a taxqualified plan may only make investments that are authorized by the appropriate governing instruments erisa imposes certain general and specific responsibilities on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an erisa plan including prudence diversification prohibited transactions and other standards  in determining whether a particular investment is appropriate for an erisa plan department of labor “dol” regulations provide that a fiduciary of an erisa plan must give appropriate consideration to among other things the role that the investment plays in the erisa plan’s portfolio taking into consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the erisa plan’s purposes an examination of the risk and return factors the portfolio’s composition with regard to diversification the liquidity and current return of the total portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the erisa plan and the proposed investment in the fund the potential ubti resulting from the investment see item   “special considerations for taxexempt investors” and the projected return of the total portfolio relative to the erisa plan’s funding objectives  before investing the assets of an erisa plan in the fund an erisa plan fiduciary should determine whether such an investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and the foregoing regulations  if a fiduciary with respect to any such erisa plan breaches his or her responsibilities with regard to selecting an investment or an investment course of action for such erisa plan the fiduciary may be held personally liable for losses incurred by the erisa plan as a result of such breach accordingly the board or its designee will require an erisa plan proposing to invest in the fund to represent that it and any fiduciaries responsible for the erisa plan’s investments are aware of and  understand the fund’s investment objective policies and strategies that the decision to invest plan assets in the fund was made with appropriate consideration of relevant investment factors with regard to the erisa plan and that the decision to invest plan assets in the fund is consistent with the duties and

charge upon request by calling toll free  and  on the sec’s website at httpwwwsecgov item   control persons and principal holders of securities none item   investment advisory and other services see the discussion contained in item  of part a of this registration statement item   portfolio managers compensation  the adviser compensates each portfolio manager for his management of the fund  each portfolio manager’s compensation consists of a fixed annual salary plus a discretionary annual bonus determined generally as follows  thirty percent of each portfolio manager’s compensation is tied to the corporate performance of sei as measured by the earnings per share earned for a particular year  this is set at the discretion of sei and not the adviser  seventy percent of each portfolio manager’s compensation is based upon various performance factors including the portfolio manager’s performance versus a risk free rate proxy such as the merrill lynch  month us libor index over the past one two and three years  weighted to one year  to each of the others  the performance factor is based upon a target outperformance of the merrill lynch  month us libor index  another key factor is the portfolio managers’ team objectives which relate to key measurements of execution efficiency ie equitization efficiency hedging efficiency trading efficiency etc  a final factor is a discretionary component which is based upon a qualitative review of the portfolio managers and their team ownership of fund shares  as of the date of this registration statement the portfolio managers did not beneficially own any shares of the fund other accounts  as of june   in addition to the fund the portfolio managers were responsible for the daytoday management of certain other accounts as

interest in connection with his management of the fund’s investments on the one hand and the investments of the other accounts on the other  the other accounts include portions of two us registered high yield mutual funds and an irish registered high yield fund collectively the “other accounts”  the other accounts might have similar investment objectives as the fund or hold purchase or sell securities that are eligible to be held purchased or sold by the fund  while the portfolio managers’ management of the other accounts may give rise to the following potential conflicts of interest the adviser does not believe that the conflicts if any are material or to the extent any such conflicts are material the adviser believes that it has designed policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage those conflicts in an appropriate way knowledge of the timing and size of fund trades a potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers’ daytoday management of the fund  because of their position with the fund the portfolio managers know the size timing and possible market impact of fund trades it is theoretically possible that the portfolio managers could use this information to the advantage of the other accounts and to the possible detriment of the fund  however the adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time  investment opportunities a potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers’ management of the fund and the other accounts which in theory may allow them to allocate investment opportunities in a way that favors the other accounts over the fund this conflict of interest may be exacerbated to the extent that the adviser or the portfolio managers receive or expect to receive greater compensation from their management of the other accounts than the fund  notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest it is the adviser’s policy to manage each account based on its investment objectives and related restrictions and as discussed above the adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time and in a manner consistent with each account’s investment objectives and related restrictions for example while the portfolio managers may buy for an other account securities that differ in identity or quantity from securities bought for the fund such an approach might not be suitable for the fund given its investment objectives and related restrictions the adviser may enter into incentive fee arrangements with one or more investors in the sei structured credit segregated portfolio the “offshore feeder fund” a segregated portfolio of sei offshore advanced strategies series spc a segregated portfolio company established in the cayman islands that acts as a feeder fund for the fund whereby a portion of the increase in the net asset value of such investor’s investment in the offshore feeder fund over a given period shall be payable to the adviser  this arrangement may create an incentive for the adviser to make investments for the fund that are riskier or more speculative than if the adviser had no such interest because the adviser will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation in the value of the offshore feeder fund’s assets if the value of its investment in the fund declines  notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest it is the adviser’s policy to manage each account based on its investment objectives and related restrictions and the adviser believes that it has designed policies and procedures that are designed to manage such conflict in an appropriate way for a further discussion regarding the potential conflicts of interests that may arise in connection with the adviser’s management of the fund see item  of part a of

prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  appendix a ratings of corporate bonds and commercial paper sp corporate bond ratings aaa  bonds rated aaa have the highest rating assigned by sp  capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong aa  bonds rated aa have a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and differ from the higher rated issues only in small degree a  bonds rated a have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories bbb  bonds rated bbb are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay principal and interest  whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay principal and interest for bonds in this category than for bonds in higher rated categories bb b ccc cc c  bonds rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded on balance as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation  bb indicates the lowest degree of speculation and c the highest degree of speculation  while such bonds will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk exposures to adverse conditions d  bonds rated d are in default and payment of interest andor repayment of principal is in arrears plus  or minus   the ratings above may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major categories moody’s corporate bond ratings aaa  bonds rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality  they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as “gilt edge”  interest payments are protected by a large or an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure  although the various protective elements are likely to change the changes that can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of the issuer aa  bonds rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards  together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as “high grade bonds”  they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaarated securities fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present that make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaarated securities a  bonds rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations  factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present that suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baa  bonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured  interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of a time  these bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well ba  bonds rated ba are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured  often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future  uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class b  bonds rated b generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment  assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period time may be small caa  bonds rated caa are of poor standing  such issues may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest ca  bonds rated ca represent obligations that are speculative in a high degree  such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings c  bonds rated c are the lowest rated class of bonds and issues so rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any real investment standing modifiers  moody’s may apply numerical modifiers   and  in each generic rating classification described above  the modifier  indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates that the issuer ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category sp commercial paper ratings a  this highest category indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely payment is strong  those issues determined to possess extremely strong safety characteristics are denoted with a plus sign  moody’s commercial paper ratings issuers rated prime or related supporting institutions also known as p have a superior capacity for repayment of shortterm promissory obligations  prime repayment capacity will normally be evidenced by the following characteristics ·                  leading market positions in wellestablished industries ·                  high rates of return on funds employed ·                  conservative capitalization structures with moderate reliance on debt and ample asset protection ·                  broad margins in earnings coverage of fixed financial charges and high internal cash generation and ·                  wellestablished access to a range of financial markets and assured sources of alternate liquidity a appendix b sei investments management corporation proxy voting procedures sei investments management corporation “simc” serves as investment adviser to multiple clients including investment companies institutions and individual investors  as investment adviser simc has an obligation to vote proxies with respect to securities held in client portfolios in the best economic interests of simc’s clients for which it has proxy voting authority  the following procedures are intended to ensure that proxies are voted in the best interests of clients a            establishment of proxy voting committee      simc shall establish a proxy voting committee the “committee” comprised of representatives of simc’s investment management shares and legal andor compliance personnel  currently the members of the committee are as follows michael hogan gregory stahl john diederich kevin mcnamera noreen park michael brophy      the membership of the committee may be changed at any time upon approval of the existing members of the committee or by the president of simc      the committee shall meet as necessary to perform any of the activities set forth below      any action requiring approval of the committee shall be deemed approved upon an affirmative vote by a majority of the committee present or represented      the committee shall consult with counsel or other experts as it deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities b            approval of proxy voting guidelines      the committee shall approve guidelines that set forth the manner in which simc shall vote or the manner in which simc shall determine how to vote with respect to various matters that may come up for shareholder vote with respect to securities held in client accounts and for which simc has proxy voting responsibility      in the event that any employee of simc recommends a change to simc’s guidelines the committee shall meet to consider the proposed change and consider all relevant factors  if approved by the committee the change shall be accepted and the guidelines revised accordingly b c            circumstances where simc will not vote proxies      for accounts that engage in securities lending simc believes that the additional income derived by clients from such activities generally outweighs the potential economic benefit of recalling securities for the purpose of voting  therefore simc generally will not recall securities on loan for the sole purpose of voting proxies      in accordance with local law or business practices many foreign companies prevent the sales of shares that have been voted for a certain period beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and ending on the day following the meeting “share blocking” depending on the country in which a company is domiciled the blocking period may begin a stated number of days prior to the meeting eg one three or five days or on a date established by the company while practices vary in many countries the block period can be continued for a longer period if the shareholder meeting is adjourned and postponed to a later date similarly practices vary widely as to the ability of a shareholder to have the “block” restriction lifted early eg in some countries shares generally can be “unblocked” up to two days prior to the meeting whereas in other countries the removal of the block appears to be discretionary with the issuer’s transfer agent simc believes that the disadvantage of being unable to sell the stock regardless of changing conditions generally outweighs the advantages of voting at the shareholder meeting for routine items accordingly simc generally will not vote those proxies subject to “share blocking” d            conflicts of interest      simc has elected to retain a third party proxy voting service the “service” to vote proxies with respect to accounts for which simc serves as investment adviser and retains proxy voting authority  the service shall vote proxies in accordance with the guidelines approved by the committee  simc reasonably believes that the service’s implementation of the guidelines will result in proxies being voted in the best economic interests of clients  so long as the service votes proxies in accordance with the guidelines simc believes that there is an appropriate presumption that the manner in which simc voted was not influenced by and did not result from a conflict of interest      the service makes available to simc prior to voting on a proxy its recommendation on how to vote with respect to such proxy in light of simc’s guidelines  simc retains the authority to overrule the service’s recommendation and instruct the service to vote in a manner at variance with the service’s recommendation  the exercise of such right could implicate a conflict of interest  as a result simc may not overrule the service’s recommendation with respect to a proxy unless the following steps are taken a     the proxy voting committee shall meet to consider the proposal to overrule the service’s recommendation b     the proxy voting committee must determine whether simc has a conflict of interest with respect to the issuer that is the subject of the proxy the committee will use the following standards to identify issuers with which it may have a conflict of interest      significant business relationships – the committee will determine whether simc or its affiliates may have a significant business relationship with the issuer such as for example where simc or an affiliate manages a pension plan administers b employee benefit plans or provides brokerage underwriting insurance or banking services to the issue  for this purpose a “significant business relationship” is one that  represents  or  of simc’s or an affiliate’s revenues for the most recent fiscal year whichever is less or is reasonably expected to represent this amount for the current fiscal year or  may not directly involve revenue to simc or its affiliates but is otherwise determined by the committee to be significant to simc or its affiliates such as for example the following ·      simc or its affiliates lease significant office space from the company or have some other real estaterelated relationship with the issuer ·      simc or an affiliate otherwise has a significant relationship with the company such that it might create an incentive for simc to vote in favor of management      significant personalfamily relationships – the committee will determine whether any employees who are involved in the proxy voting process may have a significant personalfamily relationship with the issuer  for this purpose a “significant personalfamily relationship” is one that would be reasonably likely to influence how simc votes proxies  to identify any such relationships the committee shall obtain information about any significant personalfamily relationship between any employee of simc who is involved in the proxy voting process eg imu analysts members of the committee senior management as applicable and senior employees of issuers for which simc may vote proxies      duties of the proxy committee  the committee has a duty to make reasonable investigation of information relating to conflicts of interest  for purposes of identifying conflicts the committee shall rely on publicly available information about simc and its affiliates information about simc and its affiliates that is generally known by employees of simc and other information actually known by a member of the committee  absent actual knowledge the committee is not required to investigate possible conflicts involving simc where the information is i nonpublic ii subject to information blocking procedures or iii otherwise not readily available to the committee  in connection with the consideration of any proxy voting matters under this policy each member of the committee has a duty to disclose to the committee any material conflicts of interest of which the member has actual knowledge but which have not been identified by the committee pursuant to these procedures and if appropriate recuse himselfherself from the matter at issue c     if simc determines that it has a conflict of interest the committee shall determine whether the conflict is “material” to any specific proposal included within the proxy  if not then simc can vote the proxy as determined by the committee the committee shall determine whether a proposal is material as follows      routine proxy proposals – proxy proposals that are “routine”shall be presumed not to involve a material conflict of interest for simc unless the committee has actual            the procedures provide that the committee should be aware of information about simc or its affiliates that is generally known by employees of simc but it does not extend this knowledge to information about simc’s affiliates that is generally known by employees of simc’s affiliates unless such information also is generally known by simc’s employees b knowledge that a routine proposal should be treated as material  for this purpose “routine” proposals would typically include matters such as the selection of

how simc will vote on the proposal or otherwise obtain instructions from the client as to how the proxy on the proposal should be voted      use recommendation of the service – vote in accordance with the service’s recommendation e     for any proposal where the committee determines that simc does not have a material conflict of interest the committee may overrule the service’s recommendation if
