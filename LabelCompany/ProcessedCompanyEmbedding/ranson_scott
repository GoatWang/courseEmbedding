scotts rockdevouring allmountain carbon fiber frame its components are still good enough to preserve the ransoms famed doeverything capabilitiesride  handling abilitychallenging funthe ransom is a fascinating blend of crosscountry and allmountain capabilities six inches of travel either end upright position and big brakes says allmountain but it turns out to flow beautifully through singletrack that makes the ransom an allday bike with some superbly useful extra top end for those moments when things get fastas a cardcarrying crosscountry wuss i initially found it on the scary side of exciting when the going got steep the ransom bounds away from you quickly unaffected by trivia like rocks boulders and small cars a fast steep descent immediately becomes an exercise in hanging on and prayingwhen you get used to it though – wahoo flip the travel control lever on the bar to fulltravel sled mode and awaaaaaay you go i was thankful time and again for the smooth control and huge power of the avid juicy brakes being able to limit the travel to  inches for dirt climbs and zero for tarmac is a boon with the suspension locked in shorttravel mode the bike sits up and pootles pleasantly uphill its never going to be a lightweight crosscountry bike on the climbs – not even a fully suspended one – but its plenty tolerable for the paybackwhere the ransom struggles is steep technical climbs faced with a sequence of steps and ledges its heft and long front end make it less than sprightly its fine if you can rush the problem and muscle through it letting the suspension soak up the edges but it lacks lowspeed finesseits an amazing package though and perfectly suited to a crosscountry rider who wants to play in the steeps but still ride back upchassis longtravel carbon lovelinessthe ransoms carbon frame is the most visually and technically startling aspect of the bike carbon is seen as the material for superlight flighty crosscountry hardtails not allmountain trail tyrants but scotts execution in the ransom has proven robust theres something like g of extra material in there beyond what scott thinks is essential to make sure its toughnestling low in the frame is scotts equalizer triple chamber shock this custom airsprung unit offers seven different adjustments and its vital to take the time to get it dialled in once you do it combines with the linkageactivated lowpivot to provide suspension travel with that bottomless feel thats nevertheless tightly controlled it never bounces or wallows just soaks up the bumpswe ended up running the pressure a bit softer than scott recommends that increased the sag and made the back end feel deep plush and absorptive of everything equipment decent midrange gearthe ransom  sports a carefully chosen selection of parts that complement its abilities and tread the fine line between durability and excessive gram countthe sram x rear derailleur sram x triggers and shimano deore lx front derailleur combine with the sram chain and cassette to make up a quickshifting fussfree transmissionour only gripe with the gears is that wed like an  cassette instead of the fitted  the ransom climbs well for a in travel bike but you still need all the help you can get to haul its kg lb heft upslopeownbrand wheels can be a bit of a red light but scotts sos p rims have handled my lack of finesse and shrugged off at least one ribbruising crashtheyre shod with schwalbe nobby nicks which everyone loves in moist conditions but which we found a bit skatey on loose dry australian trails getting the tyre pressure exactly right helped too soft and they fold too hard and they skim avid juicy five brakes may not be as light or as tweakable as their more expensive stablemates but they have plenty of stopping power initially a bit grabby they bedded in to the maverick speedball highadjustable seatpost quickly becomes addictive steep drop flip the saddle down and roll off riding along flip it back up and away you go if there was a mm version available id be reaching for my credit card to fit one to my main bike speedball design licensee crank brothers says the mm version announced at interbike last year is coming in we were less impressed with the rather clunky scott ownbrand saddle and swapped it for something less overpadded and in the wayconclusion push yourselfthe ransom  is the perfect

trails with a lightness that’s surprising when you consider its weight it also climbs reasonably well and excels on downhills we never noticed the nearﬁve pounds of extra weight the ransom carries over our regular shortertravel crosscountry fullsusserride  handling unstoppable downhill surprisingly good upscott achieved the rare feat of building a longtravel bike that pedals properly while still being able to soak up major terrain with ease whichever way you cut the ransom it’s a challenging bike and proves that scott isn’t afraid to spit in the face of conventiontake in its butch looks and a weight of more than lb and you’d be forgiven for assuming that climbing on the ransom is akin to pushing a threeseater sofa uphill climbing on the scott isn’t going to make you feel like an athlete but if you use the gears provided and give yourself a sensible timeframe to make it up the mountain you will get there and you’ll be able to pedal all the way to the top traction is one thing this bike delivers in spades when you hit those superslow slippery rockyrooty climbs just relax hit the barmounted tc switch to set the shock in ‘traction’ mode and keep the torque low with the help of the bitey schwalbe tyres the bike will then give you the summit on a silver traywipe the sweat from your brow – and you will be sweating – and release the tc switch back to the mminch alltravel mode you’re now clear to run amok pumping and pushing every lump bump rock root dip and turn you’ll marvel at the suspension’s ability to eat trail while you hit the gas without feeling like you’re pedalling a jelly some of this excellent trail behaviour can be attributed to the frame’s inherent design although a good deal must also be apportioned to the equalizer rear shock and the rockshox lyrik fork both are able to balance the demands for both butterysmooth travel and efﬁcient hill climbing with the sort of dexterity usually reserved for circus platespinners with the fork in full mm travel mode the ransom feels easy to steer even with its degree head angle – you don’t get the ﬂoppy front wheel feeling that some longtravel trail bikes have wind the travel down with the rear to match and it becomes a more precise climber but you’re only counting the seconds before you can ﬂick it back to life this bike isn’t meant to be tippytoed around the mountain it’s supposed to grind it into dust – a job the ransom does only too well hell it doesn’t even spit out the stones if you like the sound of this but still aren’t convinced by carbon then try one of the cheaper alloyframed versions with the bonus of a further degree off the head angle for an aggressive ride back down the mountainframe why carbon ﬁbre that’s the question many people pose when faced with the ransom – it’s not the material you’d immediately think of for a tough allmountain bikebut scott’s reply is “why not” the company has spent more time honing its understanding design and production skills with carbon ﬁbre than any other bike maker for scott making the ransom out of carbon wasn’t a risk at least not in a material sense the only risk was that buyers might not believe it could cope with allmountain levels of punishmentto play on the safe side though scott also offers two ransom models with an alloy frame – the  and the burlylooking ransom certainly stands out even in the butch world of allmountain bikes this is largely down to the oversizing of almost every tube one the frame the splitting of the topseat tube brace adds to the ransom’s ‘meaty’ feeling at lb including the rear shock the carbon heart of the ransom is ﬁt and lithe leading to an allup weight of an astonishing kglb for this ‘’ model choose the topoftherange ltd model and you break the magic lb barrierone of the ransom’s standout features is scott’s bespoke rear shock called equalizer tc the innovative system with its triple chamber comes with a barmounted remote lever that allows you to select the optimum shock and ride feel on the move choose between ‘lockout’ mode ‘traction’ mode with  inches of rear travel and ‘alltravel’ in of travel simply by ﬂicking the leverequipment specced for performance not gramsany bike which can pack the mm travel punch and still make it to within a whisker of lb without recourse to unsuitable lightweight shortcuts in componentry deserves a medal before it even turns a pedal better than that the ransom  – as specced from the factory – comes with everything you need to challenge any alpine trail from the serious in schwalbe nobby nic tyres on tough dt swiss e wheels to the fulllength fully sealed cables and sweet maverick speedball heightadjustable seat post this is deﬁnitely a case of scott speccing for ability not weight limitsverdict for nontechnophobes with real mountains to play inwho should buy the ransom any ambitious ‘real mountain’ rider who also wants to bathe in the warm waters of cuttingedge mountain bike technology certainly technophobes need not apply – they’d get a headache trying to understand the equalizer shockit must be said the ransom needs to be owned by people who ride on rough tough hills on a regular basis if you live and ride in surrey the ransom just doesn’t make sense leave it in the shop and buy a scott spark instead – you’ll get a lot more use out of itthe designer sayspeter denk was responsible for many of scott’s innovative bikes he now has his own company denk engineering but still has a soft spot for the ransom…how do you feel about the ransom now you’ve left scottthe ransom is my baby and still the bike i love the most i believe this kind of versatile bike with its adjustable rear shock is how mountain bikes will be in the future riders will be happy to shift the suspension as well as the gearswas the ransom conceptdriven or materialdrivenabsolutely conceptdriven with the genius shock we introduced the concept of adjustable spring rates but the difference between traction and full mode wasn’t big enough for our tastes developing the ots equalizer gave us the possibility to realise a shock where the spring rate could be doubledthe ransom was the platform around which we designed the ots that we did it out of carbon as well was because we wanted it as light as possible however for us the revolution is not that we saved  grams it’s that the ransom makes you start riding differently you’ll head for steeper and more technical hills than ever before and that’s just pure fundo you think you could have developed the ransom further we could have built it much lighter but then it wouldn’t have had that aggressive look — and style is fundamental in this category also we sacriﬁ ced a lot of weight because having a seat post that you can lower is a mustdoes it make you proud that no one else has produced a challenger for the ransom actually it makes me a bit sad that it takes such a long time to bring a multitravel concept to the market it was the same when we started developing longtravel xc

report that is given to every malware threat that has been collected and analyzed through our malware research center the esg threat scorecard evaluates and ranks each threat by using several metrics such as trends incidents and severity over time in addition to the effective scoring for each threat we are able to interpret anonymous geographic data to list the top three countries infected with a particular threat the data used for the esg threat scorecard is updated daily and displayed based on trends for a day period the esg threat scorecard is a useful tool for a wide array of computer users from end users seeking a solution to remove a particular threat or security experts pursuing analysis and research data on emerging threats each of the fields listed on the esg threat scorecard containing a specific value are as follows ranking the current ranking of a particular threat among all the other threats found on our malware research database threat level the level of threat a particular pc threat could have on an infected computer the threat level is based on a particular threats behavior and other risk factors we rate the threat level as low medium or high the different threat levels are discussed in the spyhunter risk assessment model infected pcs the number of confirmed and suspected cases of a particular threat detected on infected pcs retrieved from diagnostic and scan log reports generated by spyhunters spyware scanner  change the daily percent change in the frequency of infected pcs of a specific threat the formula for percent changes results from current trends of a specific threat an increase in the rankings of a specific threat yields a recalculation of the percentage of its recent gain when a specific threats ranking decreases the percentage rate reflects its recent decline for a specific threat remaining unchanged the percent change remains in its current state the  change data is calculated and displayed in three different date ranges in the last  hours  days and  days next to the percentage change is the trend movement a specific malware threat does either upward or downward in the rankings each level of movement is color coded a green

start the executable from there and then get more access or is it only local to the machine the virus hit terri  years ago found that some files can be recovered by right clicking and choosing previous versions only do this after running a full antivirus scan otherwiseanything that this computer touches will get infected do not attach usb drives while infected seb  years ago pleaseee got any solution to the encrypted files says the virus makes copies of original and deletes but nor can seek recovery programs dolmac d’ ont work your solution tori  years ago my laptop primary computer was infected december  i had an it person take a look…new security softwarehardware was installed and my files and photos are all gone the consumer product safety commission or somebody needs to prevent this custo  years ago you must have really needed those files to pay the ransom concerned  years ago did paying the ransom work triton  years ago the latest version of cryptowall wipes out all your files wholesale the only way to have your files back is by using data recovery softwares or better yet from an external source tim s  years ago to richard carry you say you were able to decrypt the files exactly how my mother’s computer was hit – oct   for those whose are ‘adamant’ about not paying to having them decrypted obviously haven’t lost years of files that include financial family history personal files we would be more than willing to pay but a service tech wipe the computer clean of the virus before we realized the only way to get them decrypted was to pay them now we have over  encrypted useless files we had the files backup on an external hard drive that was connected to the computer the virus hit that too victim too  years ago paying these thieves is like negotiating with terrorists if you pay you’re only making things worse and you’re voluntarily inviting them into your computer to make things worse down the road plus you’re wearing a target since they know you’ve paid before… you’ll keep paying again these people will eventually get caught don’t be a part of the problem thai  years ago should i go ahead paying the cryptowall if i pay what are the chance of decrypt my file richard carey  years ago i have seen this trojan first hand once the original file is not deleted so you cannot recover deleted files to get yourself out of trouble i can’t believe that some of you have talked to a number of it specialists and they have told you to pay the ransom i have recovered the files twice that were encrypted by cryptowall once locally the second time across the globe deb s  years ago i got the virus last night i have an image backup from an external drive but it does not include all files as i save some files directly to a nd drive unfortunately this drive was connected last night when i got the virus and it also got the virus my virus software it dept says that it seems to just be malware that encrypts the files and deletes the original my dilemma is that i need to try to recover the files on the external drive – is this possible shannon  years ago omg so good joe  years ago have there been any positive results in retrieving the data left on the hard drive i have been infected on a windows  machine bokchoy  years ago windows  has previous file options which you may be able to go back to… otherwise if you don’t have backups you’re sol unless you want to pay  extortion to get the decrypt ability in response to the article the exe file created seems to be random the one i saw had a different random string of charactors for a name i’ve seen cryptolocker before and cryptolocker appeared to act faster or more efficiently i’m working on clean up now and there’s directories that have some files encrypted whereas others are not so i’m confused as to whether i just got to it in time or what for any average user sorry if you’ve gotten infected  is a bit much for most people but if you don’t have back ups that’s the only current way to get your files back in the future keep backups on a device that’s not left connected to your computer dolmac  years ago here is how to recover your files the ransomware function this way  when a user launch it usually by email it will encrypt all their files and add in each directory a document explaining that they will have to pay in bitcoin  to recover their files fyi if you pay you will actually recover your files but is there another solution than paying  or  to some kind of mafia  yes  poweroff the machine  the faster the better cryptowall operate this way  first it will do a copy of your original file and encrypt it with what they claim to be a rsa key then it will delete the original files it goes on until it encrypted all files on all disks and network shares the user can access in a second time it will try to delete any windows shadowcopies of your files to prevent you to recover a previous quotunencryptedquot version of your files the reason you should power off the machine quickly is that it might prevent the suppression of shadowcopies then all you have to do is power on the machine press f launch it in safe mode and use antimalware programs to clean the virus then use the quotprecedent versionquot tab on properties of your user folders to recover unencrypted files  what if you have no shadow copies and no backup of your files  there is still a way as i said cryptowall doesn’t encrypt your original files it will do a copy of it encrypt it and delete the original file as you probably know a deleted file can be recover if nothing as been written over it on your disk good think you quickly power off the machine soon after the infection  now all you have to do is take your hard drive out put it in another machine as external drive or second drive if you don’t have a sata dock an run a file recovery program i use ontrack easyrecovery or rstudio or even datarescue for mac the pro version of ontrack easyrecovery might also be able to recover files from a raid array if one of your network share as been encrypted and you don’t have backups all these programs will be able to recover the original files deleted by cryptowall just make sure when you run those to not do it directly on the original machine as by writing on your infected disk the program could overwrite your deleted files you should be able to recover  of your files using this method after you recover your files always do a clean format  install of your machine of course the best way to protect you from this kind of virus is always the same  have a backup always and a good up to date av bob smith  years ago we were able to copy files from a previous restore point although the restore option was greyed out victim  years ago my pc was infected and i am try all tools i all speak with many it specialist and everybody told me that i must pay ransom if i want to receive my files after  weeks i paid  usd and after  hours receive decrypt tool… cryptowall is worst what can

also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a

offselect furnitureshop nowrelated product reviewsdoing a great job to accommodate my eye glassesi always struggled to position my eye glasses in the right spot with my old googles to do this in a cold area and with my gloves off it was more than a hassle this goggle does exactly what it said i can easily pull it down and cover my eye glasses directlygreatgreat for our family ski trip  better than using rental helmets  good price nice adjustable fit and they are cutequality helmet except for painful rivetthe helmet has excellent quality with its style fit and padding on the first usage of the helmet on the ski slope we were surprised when our  year old daughter told us that the helmet was hurting her head we took off her helmet and looked inside it behind the circular adjustment was a th inch round rivet that is exposed and protrudes by th of an inch of course we had cut the tags at home we put the helmet back on her head and tucked her jacket hood between the helmet and the back of her head so that she could ski comfortably now that we are back home im looking into putting duct tape or finding some extra bicycle helmet padding to attach or glue onto the helmet our other lucky bums helmets do not have this protruding rivet and are covered with padding so hopefully your helmet will be finegreat helmetour son used this helmet from  months in a pack on my back while skiing a year and a half on my back and up to three years when my son was skiing tip to bottom the helmet is very adjustable and when our broke they sent us a new one no questions asked great helmet for very young snow sports and very adjustable decent helmetdecent helmet i would recommend this item for anyone that does not need specific or odd fitting headgearhad to return ityou know how it is when you order something online that is sized  a hit or miss proposition have to say the lucky bums snow sport helmets run small as compared to their reported size would have kept the helmet if it was just a tad bigger overstock let me return the helmet very satisfiedi ended up ordering four of these helmets two black and two silver for my family to go snow skiing we were all satisfied and have no complaintssnomobile helmetmy son uses the helmet and likes it very much has ventilation in so shield does not fog up and size fits well for him supports neck the way the helmet is formed and padedgood quality helmetthis is the first ski helmet i have ever boughtworn i bought it mainly to attach a camera to it while i ski the helmet was nice it is warm i didnt wear any type of hat with it except for one cold day in colorado when it was below zero i liked it i shopped around this was the best price i could findsponsored linkswhats thisbrandssmith opticsbollerevoraiderlucky bumscapixventurahot
