expiration of the trs agreement for  million sharesjul   about seadrill limited sdrl fun trading special situations contrarian longshort equity valuesummaryjune    hemen holding ltd indirectly controlled by john fredriksen has extended trs agreements for  million shares of sdrl the new expiration of the trs agreements is september th  the exercise price on the agreements is nok  us  per share down from nok  us  every move made by john fredriksen is an important topic to analyze are we going to get another delay of some sort source seadrill seadrill ltd nysesdrl investment strategy sadly filing for bankruptcy is now a familiar occurrence in the offshore drilling industry after hercule offshore now gone paragon offshore pgnpq ocean rig udw orig and probably soon pacific drilling pacd we are waiting for seadrill to release the news everyone here knows that seadrill nysesdrl and its subsidiaries such as north atlantic drilling nysenadl are in the process of restructuring their huge debt  billion either through an outofcourt deal or through chapter  we all expect now an agreement by the end of july after the company announced early april that it managed to get another delay to complete the restructuring plan of course seadrill may push the can even further down the road if necessary as i said before very often in these particular situations shareholders will be offered a tiny percentage of the new stock and i believe seadrill restructuring plan will leave between  to  to present shareholders the company warned in april that shareholders will get a minimal recovery which implies that sdrl shareholders should expect for a tiny stake in exchange of their shares  different from zero  in the new reorganized seadrill the stock took a dive on the news depending on which side of the fence you are standing on it is easy to use this statement any which way you can as clint easwood said as i indicated in my preceding article seadrill may come up with an outofcourt deal  with the consent of the majority of the bondholders  which is generally more favorable for present shareholders in my opinion the major difference in this particular restructuring case is that the main player is john fredriksen worth over  billion who owns  of the company stocks through hemen holdings ltd hence the best strategy is to adopt a middle way attitude based on the most likely scenario which is a restructuring under a prepackaged bankruptcy deal that leaves a small stake to shareholders in the new company the topic of this article is to talk about what could be a minimal recovery translated in share price and how to trade the stock with a profit recent development from hemen holdings ltd on june   we learned the following hemen holding ltd which is indirectly controlled by trusts established by john fredriksen for the benefit of his immediate family has extended trs agreements relating to  million shares in seadrill limited the new expiration of the trs agreements is september th  the exercise price on the agreements is nok  per share hemen holding ltds affiliated ownership in seadrill is following this transaction unchanged  shares constituting  percent of the issued share capital in addition hemen holding holds trs agreements with exposure to  shares in seadrill limited a trs is a total return swap is another popular derivative contract that was developed from a traditional swap format to enable synthetic replication of financial asset i waited a few weeks to give my opinion on this recent development because i was curious to see what effect could represent this announcement on the stock price based on an exchange rate between nok to us  norwegian krone   nok  represents  apparently the market did not move much about this deal however the sudden sell off on june  with a volume close to  million shares is still a big enigma yes socalled russell rebalancing day may have played a big part of the sell off in the last half hour of the trading day in june  as we all know seadrill is also a component of the russell  the russell  is one of the leading indices tracking smallcap companies in the united states and therefore the sell off could be logically attributed to this issue that is the annual reconstitution of the russell indexes where the index provider makes rulebased changes to the composition of its indexes to ensure that changes in market value or investment styles like shares of companies deemed value or growth for example are properly accounted however we cannot rule out some sort of manipulation directly related to sdrl using the russell rebalancing day as just a pretext the stock skidded down  that day mainly in the last  minutes of trading on friday in fact in retrospect sdrl was the victim of a triple whammy that day crude toppled below  on bearish inventory data in the usa in june  russel  rebalancing end of the trading week unfortunately while oil prices have recovered nicely since june  from  a barrel to now  conversely sdrlis still trading close to the low achieved in january  this suggests that  may well be a strong support until the news hit the wire on the restructuring the question is the significance of the  pricing by the street now we have no easy way to logically define what could be the value of sdrl after restructuring and we are reduced to a simple guessing i base my thinking empirically on the book value and the potential stake given to the stockholders for their shares in the new company the book value is used when referring to the total amount of stockholders equity appearing on a corporations balance sheet again this book value is not an indication of the market value of the corporation it simply indicates the amounts appearing on the books for the assets less the amounts appearing for the liabilities a corporation can be far more valuable than the amount of its book value to simplify my demonstration i will take the book value indicated by yahoo which is  adjusted by the brent oil price divided by  per barrel anything below  is bearish percentage given to stockholders n pps equivalent bv x n oil price ratio bv x n x brent                based on the table above it seems that a  stake is the probable outcome that the street is betting on this is also what i believe will happen thus i think any deal below  will be damaging for the stock and the price per share may eventually sink another  the hemen holding trs agreements may suggest a  instead conclusion sdrl is extremely difficult to trade and i do not recommend any investing or trading at this present stage because the risk is too high and the outlook is too blurry the best strategy is to wait for a specific news and act swiftly using the trend either on the short side or on the long side the only catalyst that could give a positive boost to the stock now is the price of oil above  a barrel according to statoil chief economist eirik waerness who spoke to bloomberg last monday oil prices will jump over  “relatively soon” he said oil prices should tighten with the next five years describing the slow recovery as a “patience game” nonopec nations must also cut production in order to reverse the supply glut “at some point this level is not sustainable” the economist added it will not happen tomorrow but when it comes to a restructuring plan it is a paramount

redeploying capital – mr fredriksen sells a small piece of seadrill  marine money offshore skip to content skip to navigation redeploying capital – mr fredriksen sells a small piece of seadrill last week john fredriksen announced that hemen holding ltd a company ultimately controlled by trusts established for the benefit of mr fredriksen’s children agreed to sell  million shares of seadrill limited to investors while entering into a privately negotiated cash or physically settled put option with goldman sachs with a  day average maturity on m shares with a strike price set at the closing price on the new york stock exchange at norwegian kroner  the highly structured put mechanism will provide purchasers with downside protection for the period specified on thursday the company announced that it has sold  million shares and  million seller put options at a combined purchase price of nok  per share and seller put option following the completion of the offering hemen will hold  million shares in addition to trs agreements with underlying exposure to  million shares if all the put options are exercised with physical delivery at expiry hemens position in seadrill will revert to the original  interest hemen’s current share ownership of  is currently worth approximately  billion and represents  of the fredriksen groups investment portfolio of the listed companies controlled by hemen through the offering hemens ownership in seadrill will be reduced to approximately  but nevertheless it will remain the largest shareholder in seadrill commensurately with the sale seadrills proportion of the fredriksen investment portfolio will be reduced from  to  the sale will allow for greater diversification of the portfolio by creating liquidity for the fredriksen group “…to aggressively pursue investment opportunities in the currently oversupplied market for commodity shipping”  such opportunities would include but not be limited to buying distressed asset companies ordering newbuildings and seeking opportunities for consolidation the company has entered into a lockup where it has agreed not to sell further shares in seadrill for a period of one year arctic securities’ erik nikolai stavseth puts these numbers into perspective “the sale will amount to approximately usd bn… we see this as a positive sign for companies like frnt and potentially gogl but also think the fredriksen group could be aiming for other segments as shown by their  order of mrs with an additional usd bn in equity at hand this could effectively turn into usd bn of investments assuming  gearing – below what most of fredriksen’s listed entities indicate as achievable financing as a backoftheenvelope perspective usd bn could turn into  vlccs  of existing fleet at usd m per vessel or  capesizes  of existing fleet at usd m per vessel – showing the firepower john fredriksen is creating for his companies” fotis giannakoulis of morgan stanley also has a hypothesis as to what mr fredriksen might do with the new found liquidity “with glng’s expansion in the lng sector already topping a bn orderbook the focus is most likely shifting towards countercyclical expansion into bulkers and tankers however in our view fredriksen’s steps could be more cautious than headlines might suggest potentially targeting an investment horizon much longer than most equity investors both tankers and bulkers are currently in a state of distress and this is not expected to change over the near term nevertheless we see exposure through newbuild orders as a possibility given recent technology changes on fuel efficiency low down payments and options that offer further leverage to the upside his recent order of  fuelefficient product tankers with  delivery could be only a first step in our view with the longterm outlook for crude tankers negative and asset values still high we would expect to see further expansion in the dry bulk market we would also not exclude the possibility of a distressed deal in containerships as the kg market is suffering” we find ourselves in fotis’ court mr fredriksen has shown a preference on the drilling side to order new state of the art equipment to earn premium rates moreover pricing and terms are in his favor as he points out of course the last thing the world needs now is more ships yes oil prices are high and there is no end in sight or is there  we recall financing us line’s round the world service which was built upon  “jumbo”  teu lowcost slow speed container vessels with fuel efficient engines in the early s the concept was the brainchild of malcolm mclean in the early s when everyone was talking about barrel oil it never came and speed was of the essence it also did not help that the main trade flows were largely unidirectional across the transpacific by  us lines filed for bankruptcy the reason for the digression for this santayana moment is to remind all of the importance of institutional memory on the other hand we have learned over time to expect the unexpected when it comes to both markets and mr fredriksen so we will not be taking bets lastly we wax philosophical and thought about the tradeoff of the fuel savings versus the energy expenditures involved in the construction and the premature destruction due to socalled economic obsolescence of assets designed to trade for thirty years then there are the piles of steel that need to be transformed yet again through the use of more energy everything has a price and for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
