list of bigname investors venture firms biotech executives even the owners of the hub’s local sports teams among flex’s backers are westphal’s own venture fund longwood fund vc firms such as lightstone ventures bessemer venture partners city hill ventures and ecor capital the owners of two of boston’s professional sports teams the kraft group owned by patriots owner bob kraft and celtics ceo and managing partner wyc grousbeck former apple ceo john sculley and his wife diane and current alnylam pharmaceuticals ceo john maraganore flex officials couldn’t be immediately reached for comment late monday and it hasn’t divulged much information but it bills itself as a developer of drugs for neuromuscular disorders and says it’s advancing a treatment to prevent muscle cramps one of flex’s scientific founders harvard medical school professor bruce bean says in a video on the company’s site that the company is looking at treatments for “all forms of muscle cramps” including those experienced by athletes elderly folks who get cramps at night and those attributed to diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als and multiple sclerosis for cramps brought on by disease flex appears to be developing prescription drugs for athletes suffering from cramps the targeted product seems to be medical foods the general idea according to the website is to stimulate nerve endings in the mouth and esophagus which should affect the activity of alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord those are the neurons responsible for muscle contractions that cause cramps when they excessively fire flex says it’s basing its products on new research that shows that cramps begin in the nerves not the muscles therefore it claims most common remedies like bananas and sports drinks don’t usually

million and it raised a  million b round in early  longwood participated in both rounds ovascience held its public offering in  and part of its pitch to investors was that its services would probably not be regulated by the fda so it would probably be able to start generating significant revenue in the us by the end of  but in  the fda ruled that it would need to file an investigational new drug application before it could start marketing the service ovasciences shares fell  in response by september  ovascience had raised and spent around  million in early december its shares were trading at

announcements the companys a financing round was  million and it raised a  million b round in early  longwood participated in both rounds ovascience held its public offering in  and part of its pitch to investors was that its services would probably not be regulated by the fda so it would probably be able to start generating significant revenue in the us by the end of  but in  the fda ruled that it would need to file an investigational new drug application before it could start marketing the service ovasciences shares fell  in response by september  ovascience had raised and spent around
