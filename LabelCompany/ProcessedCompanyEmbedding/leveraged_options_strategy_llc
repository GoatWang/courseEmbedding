everyone in between home options basics rookies corner option strategies managing positions glossary trader network the options strategies » fig leaf fig leaf aka leveraged covered call leaps diagonal spread note the profit and loss lines are not straight that’s because the leaps call is still open when the shorterterm call expires straight lines and hard angles usually indicate that all options in the strategy have the same expiration date the strategy buying the leaps call gives you the right to buy the stock at strike a selling the call at strike b obligates you to sell the stock at that strike price if you’re assigned this strategy acts like a covered call but uses the leaps call as a surrogate for owning the stock though the two plays are similar managing options with two different expiration dates makes a leveraged covered call a little trickier to run than a regular covered call the goal here is to purchase a leaps call that will see price changes similar to the stock so look for a call with a delta of  or more as a starting point when searching for an appropriate delta check options that are at least  inthemoney but for a particularly volatile stock you may need to go deeper inthemoney to find the delta you’re looking for some investors favor this strategy over a covered call because you don’t have to put up all the capital to buy the stock that means the premium you receive for selling the call will represent a higher percentage of your initial investment than if you bought the stock outright in other words the potential return is leveraged of course there are additional risks to keep in mind as well leaps unlike stock eventually expire and when they do it’s possible that you could lose the entire value of your initial investment unlike a covered call where you typically wouldn’t mind being assigned on the short option when running a fig leaf you don’t want to be assigned on the short call because you don’t actually own the stock yet you only own the right to buy the stock at strike a you wouldn’t want to exercise the long leaps call to buy the stock because of all the time value you’d give up instead you hope your short call will expire outofthemoney so you can sell another and then another and then another until the long leaps call expires note if you are going to run this strategy we’re going to make it mandatory for you to read the sections how we roll and what is early exercise and why does it happen options guys tips some investors choose to run this strategy on an expensive stock that they would like to trade but don’t want to spend the capital to buy at least  shares if the stock price exceeds the strike price of the short option before expiration you might want to consider closing out the entire position if the strategy was implemented correctly you should see a profit in such a case if you do get assigned on the short call don’t make the mistake of exercising the leaps call sell the leaps call on the open market so you’ll capture the time value if there’s any remaining along with the intrinsic value simultaneously buy the stock to cover your newly created short stock position this is a situation when it pays to have a broker who really understands options so give us a call at tradeking and we’ll help you through the process the setup buy an inthemoney leaps call strike price a sell an outofthemoney shortterm call strike price b generally the stock price will be closer to strike b than strike a note typically the leaps call will be one to two years from expiration and the shortterm call will be  to  days from expiration who should run it veterans and higher when to run it you’re mildly bullish breakeven at expiration it is possible to approximate breakeven points but there are too many variables to give an exact formula because there are two expiration dates for the options in a fig leaf a pricing model must be used to “guesstimate” what the value of the backmonth call will be when the frontmonth call expires tradeking’s profit  loss calculator can help you in this regard but keep in mind the profit  loss calculator assumes that all other variables such as implied volatility interest rates etc remain constant over the life of the trade — and they may not behave that way in reality the sweet spot you want the stock to remain as close to the strike price of the short option as possible at expiration without going above it maximum potential profit potential profit is limited to the premium received for sale of the frontmonth call plus the performance of the leaps call note you can’t precisely calculate potential profit at initiation of this strategy because it depends on how the leaps call performs and the premium received for the sale of additional shortterm calls if any at later dates maximum potential loss potential risk is limited to the debit paid to establish the strategy note you can’t precisely calculate your risk at initiation of this strategy because it depends on how the leaps call performs and the premium received for the sale of additional shortterm calls if any at later dates tradeking margin requirement after the trade is paid for no additional margin is required as time goes by time decay is your friend because the frontmonth options you sell will lose their value faster than the backmonth long leaps call implied volatility after the strategy is established the effect of implied volatility is somewhat neutral although it will increase the value of the call you sold bad it will also increase the value of the

a technique that seeks higher investment profits by using borrowed money these profits come from the difference between the investment returns on the borrowed capital and the cost of the associated interest leveraged investing exposes an investor to higher risk where does the borrowed capital come from from any source potentially but in this article well compare three common sources a brokerage margin loan a futures product such as an index of single stock future and a leap call option these forms of capital are available to virtually any investor who has a brokerage account understanding the alternatives is the first step to building the right leveraged investment so read on to learn more about how to determine what kind of leverage to use in your portfolio margin loansmargin loans use the equity in an investors account as collateral they are provided by brokers and are heavily regulated by the federal reserve and other agencies as the availability of easy investment credit was one of the factors that contributed to the  stock market crash see margin trading costsinterest rates on margin loans are comparatively high and are usually tiered for example a large online broker may charge  on margin balances above  million but  on balances below  some online brokerages provide a less expensive margin and use it as a selling point advantagesthe advantage of margin loans is that they are easy to use and the capital can be used to purchase virtually any investment for example an investor with  shares of coca cola could borrow against those shares and use the proceeds to buy put options on another security dividends from the coca cola shares could then be used to help pay the margin interest disadvantagesan investor who uses margin can face significant financial risk if the equity in the account falls below a predetermined level the broker will ask the investor to contribute additional capital or liquidate the investment position see what does it mean when the shares in my account have been liquidated the initial margin and maintenance margin serve as a cap on the amount that can be borrowed a  initial maintenance margin requirement results in a maximum initial leverage ratio of  to  or  of assets for every  of equity of course an investor that consistently uses the maximum margin available faces an increased risk of margin call in a market decline the minimums for both the initial and maintenance margin are set by the securities and exchange commission sec however some brokers do provide customers with a way to bypass these minimums by providing certain accounts with portfolio margin in these accounts margin is based on the largest potential loss of the portfolio as calculated by the underlying prices and volatilities this may result in lower margin requirements especially if hedging is used see a beginners guide to hedging stock and index futuresa futures contract is a financial instrument used to purchase a specific investment for a certain price at a later date financing costs are included in the price of the future which makes the transaction equivalent to a shortterm loan see futures fundamentals futures are often associated with currencies commodities and interest rates rather than equities however in  more than four billion of the almost  billion futures contracts traded that year were contracts on equity indexes costsalthough these products have a reputation for being beyond the reach of the typical retail investor companies are moving quickly to expand access more online brokerages now provide access to futures and less initial capital is now required to trade them for example an emini sp contract can be purchased for less than  investment selection is also limited but growing futures contracts can be purchased on wellknown indexes such as the sp  or russell  on some exchange traded funds such as dia djia tracker and now on more than  individual stocks futures contracts on stocks are known as singlestock futures ssf see surveying single stock futures advantagesfutures contracts are a favorite with traders because of their relatively low bidask spreads and the high amount of leverage provided by the contract interests costs are also much lower than margin rates they are calculated as the broker call rate minus the dividend yield paid by the underlying securities every futures contract has a settlement date upon which the contract expires but these dates are relatively meaningless as most contracts are either sold or rolled forward to a future date investors are required to maintain a cash position in order to purchase a future this is often referred to as margin but is actually a performance bond this performance bond is equal to some percentage of the underlying typically  for broad indexes and up to  for single stock futures this provides leverage from  to to  to  disadvantagesif the price of the underlying security declines the investor will have to put up more cash to maintain his or her position this is similar in practice to a margin call this can make futures very risky to prevent catastrophic losses futures are often hedged with options stock and etf optionsoptions provide a buyer with the right to buy or sell shares of a security for a specific price each option has a strike price and expiration date call options or options to buy have a builtin financing cost similar to futures however option pricing is primarily driven by seller risk which is related to the volatility of the underlying investment see options basics advantagesoptions play an important role in the market as hedging tools the potential downside risk in a futures contract is very large often many times the initial investment using options can limit this risk at the expense of some of the potential appreciation disadvantagesoptions are available for most large stocks and many popular etfs index options are more specialized and are not available at most brokers there may be dozens or even hundreds of options available for a specific security and selecting the appropriate one can be difficult part of the challenge is the tradeoff between the initial premium the leverage provided and the rate of time decay atthemoney and outofthemoney call options with closer expiration dates have the highest amount of leverage but can lose value rapidly as time passes the relative complexity of this can be discouraging for new investors see the importance of time value in options trading options expire but can be rolled over to new expiration dates by selling the existing option and purchasing a new one this can be costly depending on the bidask spreads of the two options it also results in the investor trading a higher delta option for a lower delta option see using options instead of equity the bottom linealthough futures products are still not available to many retail investors and futures contracts are not available on all products its very likely that access to these products will continue to increase futures provide investors with higher leverage at lower interest rates than margin loans resulting in greater capital efficiency and higher profit potential however some brokers have taken steps to make margin loans more competitive with futures products these brokers are charging lower interest rates and are either lowering interest rates to the sec minimums or introducing portfolio margin to bypass them altogether margin loans also allow a much broader selection of investments than futures both margin loans and futures contracts leave investors exposed to considerable downside risk declines in the underlying security can lead to large percentage losses and may require the investor to immediately provide additional funds or risk being sold out of their position at a loss call options combine the leverage and interest rates of futures with hedging in order to limit downside risk hedging can be costly but can lead to higher overall returns as it allows an investor to invest more capital rather than holding a reserve for catastrophic losses there are many tools available to leveraged investors and the selection is growing as always the challenge is knowing when and how to use each one trending the trump economy news and analysis announcing the top  most influential financial advisors who is anthony

leveraged etfs  theory and practicemay    am et includes dust erx ery fas faz gdx nugt spxl spxs tna tzaby jonathan kinlayjonathan kinlay hedge fund manager longshort equity etf investing portfolio strategyquantitative research and tradingsummaryleveraged etfs suffer from decay or beta slippage researchers have attempted to exploit this effect by shorting pairs of long and inverse leveraged etfsthe results of these strategies look good if you assume continuous compounding but are often poor when less frequent compounding is assumedin reality the trading losses incurred in rebalancing the portfolio which requires you to sell low and buy high overwhelm any benefit from decay making the strategies unprofitable in practicea short levered etf strategy has similar characteristics to a short straddle option position with positive theta and negative gamma and will experience periodic large drawdownsit is possible to develop leveraged etf strategies producing high returns and sharpe ratios with relative value techniques commonly used in option trading strategiesdecay in leveraged etfs leveraged etfs continue to be much discussed on seeking alpha one aspect in particular that has caught analysts attention is the decay or beta slippage that leveraged etfs tend to suffer from seeking alpha contributor fred picard in a  article what you need to know about the decay of leveraged etfs described the effect using the following hypothetical example to understand what is betaslippage imagine a very volatile asset that goes up  one day and down  the day after a perfect double leveraged etf goes up  the first day and down  the second day on the close of the second day the underlying asset is back to its initial price    x      and the perfect leveraged etf    x      nothing has changed for the underlying asset and  of your money has disappeared betaslippage is not a scam it is the normal mathematical behavior of a leveraged and rebalanced portfolio in case you manage a leveraged portfolio and rebalance it on a regular basis you create your own betaslippage the previous example is simple but betaslippage is not simple it cannot be calculated from statistical parameters it depends on a specific sequence of gains and losses fred goes on to make the point that is the crux of this article as follows at this point im sure that some smart readers have seen an opportunity if we lose money on the long side we make a profit on the short side right shorting leveraged etfs taking his cue from freds article seeking alpha contributor stanford chemist shorting leveraged etf pairs easier said than done considers the outcome of shorting pairs of leveraged etfs including the market vectors gold miners etf nysearcagdx the direxion daily gold miners bull x shares etf nysearcanugt and the direxion daily gold miners bear x shares etf nysearcadust his initial finding appears promising therefore investing  each into short positions of nugt and dust would have generated a profit of  for nugt and  for dust good for an average profit of  over  years or  annualized at first sight this appears to a nearly riskfree strategy after all you are shorting both the x leveraged bull and x leveraged bear funds which should result in a market neutral position is there easy money to be made source standford chemist not so fast stanford chemist applies the same strategy to another etf pair with a very different outcome what if you had instead invested  each into short positions of the direxion russell  financials bullish x etf nysearcafas and the direxion russell  financials bearish x etf nysearcafaz the  short position in faz would have gained you  however this would have been dwarfed by the  loss that you would have sustained in shorting fas in total you would be down  which translates into a loss of  over three years or  annualized no free lunch there the rebalancing issue stanford chemist puts his finger on one of the key issues rebalancing he explains as follows so what happened to the fasfaz pair essentially what transpired was that as the underlying asset xlf increased in value the two short positions became unbalanced the losing side short fas ballooned in size making further losses more severe on the other hand the winning side short faz shrunk muting the effect of further gains to counteract this effect the portfolio needs to be rebalanced stanford chemist looks at the implications of rebalancing a short nugtdust portfolio whenever the market value of either etf deviates by more than n from its average value where he considers n in the range from  to  in increments of  while the annual portfolio return was positive in all but one of these scenarios there was very considerable variation in the outcomes with several of the rebalanced portfolios suffering very large drawdowns of as much as  source stanford chemist the author concludes the results of the backtest showed that profiting from this strategy is easier said than done the total return performances of the strategy over the past three years was highly dependent on the rebalancing thresholds chosen unfortunately there was also no clear correlation between the rebalancing period used and the total return performance moreover the total return profiles showed that large drawdowns do occur meaning that despite being ostensibly market neutral this strategy still bears a significant amount of risk leveraged etf pairs  four case studies lets press pause here and review a little financial theory as you recall it is possible to express a rate of return in many different ways depending on how interest is compounded the most typical case is daily compounding r  pt  pt  pt where pt is the price on day t and pt is the price on day t one day prior another commonly used alternative is continuous compounding also sometimes called logreturns r  lnpt  lnpt where lnpt is the natural log of the price on day t pt when a writer refers to a rate of return he should make clear what compounding basis the return rate is quoted on whether continuous daily monthly or some other frequency usually however the compounding basis is clear from the context besides it often doesnt make a large difference anyway but with leveraged etfs even microscopic differences can produce substantially different outcomes i will illustrate the effect of compounding by reference to examples of portfolios comprising short positions in the following representative pairs of leveraged etfs direxion daily energy bull x shares etf nysearcaerx direxion daily energy bear x shares etf nysearcaery direxion daily gold miners bull x etf direxion daily gold miners bear x etf direxion daily sp  bull x shares etf nysearcaspxl direxion daily sp  bear x shares etf nysearcaspxs direxion daily small cap bull x etf nysearcatna direxion daily small cap bear x etf nysearcatza the findings in relation to these pairs are mirrored by results for other leveraged etf pairs first lets look the returns in the etf portfolios measured using continuous compounding source yahoo finance the portfolio returns look very impressive with cagrs ranging from around  for the short tnatza pair to over  for the short nugtdust pair sharpe ratios too appear abnormally large ranging from  for the erxery short pair to  for nugtdust now lets look at the performance of the same portfolios measured using daily compounding source yahoo finance its an altogether different picture none of the portfolios demonstrate an attract performance record and indeed in two cases the cagr is negative whats going on stock loan costs before providing the explanation lets just get one important detail out of the way since you are shorting both legs of the etf pairs you will be faced with paying stock borrow costs borrow costs for leveraged etfs can be substantial and depending on market conditions amount to as much as  per annum or more in computing the portfolio returns in both the continuous and daily compounding scenarios i have deducted annual stock borrow costs based on recent average quotes from interactive brokers as follows erxery  nugtdust  sxplspxs  tnatza  its all about compounding and rebalancing the implicit assumption in the computation of the daily compounded returns shown above is that you are rebalancing the portfolios each day that is to say it is assumed that at the end of each day you buy or sell sufficient quantities of shares of each etf to maintain an equal  value in both legs in the case of continuously compounded returns the assumption you are making is that you maintain an equal  value in both legs of the portfolio at every instant clearly that is impossible ok so if the results from low frequency rebalancing are poor while the results for instantaneous rebalancing are excellent it is surely just a question of rebalancing the portfolio as frequently as is practically possible while we may not be able to achieve the ideal result from continuous rebalancing the results we can achieve in practice will reflect how close we can come to that ideal right unfortunately not because while we have accounted for stock borrow costs what we have ignored in the analysis so far are transaction costs transaction costs with daily rebalancing transaction costs are unlikely to be a critical factor  one might execute a single trade towards the end of the trading session but in the continuous case its a different matter altogether lets use the spxlspxs pair as an illustration when the sp  index declines the value of the spxl etf will fall while the value of the spxs etf will rise in order to maintain the same  value in both legs you will need to sell more shares in spxl and buy back some shares in spxs if the market trades up spxl will increase in value while the price of spxs will fall requiring you to buy back some spxl shares and sell more spxs in other words to rebalance the portfolio you will always be trying to sell the etf that has declined in price while attempting to buy the inverse etf that has appreciated it is often very difficult to execute a sale in a declining stock at the offer price or buy an advancing stock at the inside bid to be sure of completing the required rebalancing of the portfolio you are going to have to buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price paying the bidoffer spread each time spreads in leveraged etf products tend to be large often several pennies the cumulative effect of repeatedly paying the bidask spread while taking trading losses on shares sold at the low or bought at the high will be sufficient to overwhelm the return you might otherwise hope to make from the etf decay and thats assuming the best case scenario that shares are always available to short often they may not be so that if the market trades down and you need to sell more spxl there may be none available and you will be unable to rebalance your portfolio even if you were willing to pay the additional stock loan costs and bidask spread a loselose proposition so in summary if you rebalance infrequently you will avoid excessive transaction costs but the  imbalance that accrues over the course of a trading day will introduce a market bias in the portfolio that can hurt portfolio returns very badly if you get caught on the wrong side of a major market move the results from daily rebalancing for the illustrative pairs shown above indicate that this is likely to happen all too often on the other hand if you try to maintain market neutrality in the portfolio by rebalancing at high frequency the returns you earn from decay will be eaten up by transaction costs and trading losses as you continuously sell low and buy high paying the bidask spread each time either way you lose ok what about if you reverse the polarity of the portfolio going long both legs wont that avoid the very high stock borrow costs and put you in a better position as regards the transaction costs involved in rebalancing yes it will because you will be selling when the market trades up and buying when it falls making it much easier to avoid paying the bidask spread you will also tend to make short term trading profits by selling high and buying low unfortunately you may not be surprised to learn these advantages are outweighed by the cost of the decay incurred in both legs of the long etf portfolio in other words you can expect to lose if you are short and lose if you are long an analogy from option theory to anyone with a little knowledge of basic option theory what i have been describing should sound like familiar territory being short the etf pair is like being short an option actually a pair of call and put options called a straddle you earn decay or theta for those familiar with the jargon by earning the premium on the options you have sold but at the risk of being short gamma  which measures your exposure to a major market move source interactive brokers you can hedge out the portfolios gamma exposure by trading the underlying securities  the etf pair in this case  and when you do that you find yourself always having to sell at the low and buy at the high if the options are fairly priced the option decay is enough but not more to compensate for the hedging cost involved in continuously trading the underlying conversely being long the etf pair is like being long a straddle on the underling pair you now have positive gamma exposure so your portfolio will make money from a major market move in either direction however the value of the straddle initially the premium you paid decays over time at a rate theta also known as the bleed source interactive brokers you can offset the bleed by performing what is known as gamma trading when the market trades up your portfolio delta becomes positive ie an excess  value in the long etf leg enabling you to rebalance your position by selling excess deltas at the high conversely when the market trades down your portfolio delta becomes negative and you rebalance by buying the underlying at the current reduced price in other words you sell at the high and buy at the low typically making money each time if the straddle is fairly priced the profits you make from gamma trading will be sufficient to offset the bleed but not more typically the payoff from being short options  being short the etf pair  will show consistent returns for sustained periods punctuated by very large losses when the market makes a significant move in either direction conversely if you are long options  long the etf pair  you will lose money most of the time due to decay and occasionally make a very large profit in an efficient market in which securities are fairly priced neither long nor short option strategy can be expected to dominate the other in the long run in fact transaction costs will tend to produce an adverse outcome in either case as with most things in life the house is the player most likely to win developing a leveraged etf strategy that works investors shouldnt be surprised that it is hard to make money simply by shorting leveraged etf pairs just as it is hard to make money by selling options without risking blowing up your account and yet many traders do trade options and often manage to make substantial profits in some cases traders are simply selling options hoping to earn substantial option premiums without taking too great a hit when the market explodes they may get away with it for many years before blowing up indeed that has been the case since  but who would want to be an option seller here with the market at an alltime high its simply far too risky the best option traders make money by trading both the long and the short side sure they might lean in one direction or the other depending on their overall market view and the opportunities they find but they are always hedged to some degree in essence what many option traders seek to do is what is known as relative value trading  selling options they regard as expensive while hedging with options they see as being underpriced put another way relative value traders try to buy cheap gamma and sell expensive theta this is how one can thread the needle in leveraged etf strategies you cant hope to make money simply by being long or short all the time  you need to create a longshort etf portfolio in which the decay in the etfs you are short is greater than in the etfs you are long such a strategy is necessarily tactical your portfolio holdings and net exposure will likely change from long to short or vice versa as market conditions shift there will be times when you will use leverage to increase your market exposure and occasions when you want to reduce it even to the point of exiting the market altogether if that sounds rather complicated im afraid it is i have been developing and trading arbitrage strategies of this kind since the early s often using sophisticated option pricing models in  i began trading a volatility strategy in etfs using a variety of volatility etf products in combination with equity and volatility index futures i have reproduced the results from that strategy below to give some indication of what is achievable in the etf space using relative value arbitrage techniques source systematic strategies llc source systematic strategies llc conclusion there are no free lunches in the market the apparent high performance of strategies that engage systematically in shorting leveraged etfs is an illusion based on a failure to quantify the full costs of portfolio rebalancing the payoff from a short leveraged etf pair strategy will be comparable to that of a short straddle position with positive decay theta and negative gamma exposure to market moves such a strategy will produce positive returns most of the time punctuated by very large drawdowns the short gamma exposure can be mitigated by continuously rebalancing the portfolio to maintain dollar neutrality however this will entail repeatedly buying etfs as they trade up and selling them as they decline in value the transaction costs and trading losses involved in continually buying high and selling low will eat up most if not all of the value of the decay in the etf legs a better approach to trading etfs is relative value arbitrage in which etfs with high decay rates are sold and hedged by purchases of etfs with relatively low rates of decay an example given of how this approach has been applied successfully in volatility etfs since  disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no

fidelity viewpoints –  active trader pro trading active trader pro options stocks trading active trader pro options stocks trading active trader pro options stocks trading active trader pro options stocks trading active trader pro options stocks the covered call is perhaps the most widely known options strategy it involves selling a call option on a stock you already own there is a variation of the covered call strategy known as the leveraged covered call that allows you to simulate a covered call position while not having to put up as much capital interested in knowing more first let’s review how the basic covered call works so you can fully understand this slightly more advanced version of the covered call strategy the covered call the purpose of a covered call strategy is to generate income on a stock you own it involves owning a stock and selling call options on the same stock you would consider executing a covered call if you had a neutral to slightly bearish outlook on a stock for instance suppose you owned xyz stock and believe that the stock might trade flat or weaken slightly over a certain period of time you might decide that you do not want to sell the stock perhaps because you believe it may increase in price in the long run and would like to generate some income on it during the period of time that you think it will not go up in price if you sold one call option on the stock you own you would effectively be agreeing to sell  shares of the stock at an agreedupon price known as the strike price if the option is assigned you would earn upfront income for selling the option this is a covered call in doing so you would forgo potential profits on the stock if the stock price rose above the strike price of the sold option and the calls were exercised in this event you would have to sell the stock at the strike price so you would need to be comfortable with that tradeoff the leveraged covered call this less well known variation of the traditional covered call strategy provides an alternative if you would like to put up less capital at the outset of the trade the covered call and leveraged covered call strategies share the same outlook which is neutralbearish over the short term and bullish over the longer term to construct the leveraged covered call you would sell a shorterterm call usually an outofthemoney call the key difference between a covered call and a leveraged covered call is that instead of owning the underlying stock upon which you sold the call you would buy a long deep inthemoney “leap” short for longterm equity anticipation securities leaps are options with a longer time until expiration typically nine months to a year the assumption here is that the purchase of the leap should cost less than purchasing the same amount of shares of the underlying stock while simulating the profitloss potential of the covered call position greeks and the leveraged covered call profitloss diagram covered call source fidelity learning center there are a few things you can do to potentially improve the probability of a successful leveraged covered call trade as with any other options strategy greeks can be invaluable for making the most of your trade one greek in particular delta is especially useful delta is the sensitivity of an options price to the change in the price of the underlying asset “the strike price of the purchased leap should have a high delta so that there will be a high correlation between the stock price movement and the option price movement” says colin songer a strategy desk representative with fidelity this will help simulate the profitloss diagram of the covered call strategy see the chart right “one thing to keep in mind though is that the higher the delta the more expensive the leap all other factors being the same” songer notes capital requirements assignment risk volatility the maximum risk of both strategies is similar the stock could go to zero in order to choose the appropriate strategy for the covered call or leveraged covered call you should consider several factors the primary advantage of the leveraged covered call is that the purchased leap will cost less than buying the same number of shares covered by the option this leads to a potentially higher return on investment and lower maximum loss however the sold call is at risk of assignment ie you would be short the shares depending on whether the option was assigned prior to the exdividend date this could result in a position where unlike the covered call strategy you would need to pay the dividend consequently this could have a negative effect on the profitability of this strategy unlike the covered call strategy the purchase of a leap means you are long vega vega is a measure of an option price’s sensitivity for a given change in implied volatility an increase in the implied volatility ie the expected volatility of an option will increase the value of a call or put option and falling implied volatility decreases the value of either type of option simply put an increase in implied volatility iv is good for this strategy because it would increase the value of the purchased call leap however if iv were to decrease so would the value of the options that would hurt the strategy with the leap being deep in the money vega exposure would be less than atthemoney options but would still be high due to the longer expiration a few leveraged covered call tips you may want to consider selling a shortterm call that is nearly at the money to take advantage of the acceleration of another greek theta which measures the impact of the time decay that typically happens prior to expiration this strategy may provide an opportunity to adjust strike prices as the price of the underlying security moves this allows for an increase in the frequency of selling calls against the same leap “if you are a little more bullish you can use outofthemoney call options to allow for a greater balance between potential stock appreciation and premium income” songer suggests “outofthemoney options would be used for a more bullish outlook and they allow for a higher return on investment” finally if the security moves close to the strike price of the short call it may be time to reevaluate the strategy and either roll the short option up or out to the next month buy back the short call and let the long option run or close out the strategy altogether if the short call goes in the money and your outlook changes to bearish you can take on the assignment learn more discover more about trading
