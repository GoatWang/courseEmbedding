reimagine education ensuring that students everywhere can dream bigger reach their highest potential and fulfill their aspirations through lifechanging educational experiences we help universities become the best possible digital versions of themselves so they can offer more students than ever access to transformative education u was founded in  when a small team began working on one big idea to build online degree programs as good as or better than traditional oncampus programs at top universities in the early days our work was met with skepticism it was believed then — and some believe it still — that an online program could never match the quality of education delivered on campus at u we believed — and still believe — that while higher education is changing rapidly universities that embrace the power of technology will uphold their missions and continue to grow at a scale never imagined we also believe great universities can and will continue to be the single most important catalyst for societal change our partners are creating a future where online students have the same rights and responsibilities as their oncampus counterparts we succeed because at our core we believe in this future from our executives to our marketing managers to our support counselors every u employee is united with our university partners in fulfilling the promise of education our philosophy one

versions of themselves the iconic building becomes a welldesigned learning management system the brick paths become a complex web of backend infrastructure the intimate classrooms become live video with no back row the largerthanlife professors are now connected through a device held in the palm of their hands doing this is timeconsuming and requires significant resources but helping universities develop great digital versions of themselves is our business and our platform allows our partners to advance their missions by increasing access to education through technology the following sections explore the u platform and indicate who is responsible for each element u the university or u and the university funding u the great digital version of a university requires quality and scale both of which demand significant time and resources in each program we launch u invests  million of cumulative net negative cash over the first three to five years this investment allows the program to achieve the quality and scale necessary to drive a positive impact for the university u continues to support each program through the rest of the longterm  years or more commitment earning a return on its investment over that time our proprietary program selection algorithm identifies the best university and degree pairings for potential programs   content development u  university u works with faculty to ensure that professors are able to bring their curriculum to life in the digital medium we do this with our online campus proprietary methods that feature videos and case studies and engaging interactive content u supports all university partner faculty members throughout the lifespan of each course and we build all content to be easily updated as professors’ lectures evolve over time while u funds the development of the intellectual property all rights are owned by the university   technology u us softwareasaservice saas offering supports the front and backend technology that allows our partner universities to create great digital versions of themselves in addition to the studentfacing online campus our integrated cloudbased platform provides the comprehensive operating infrastructure necessary to attract enroll educate support and graduate students globally this technology creates a seamless user experience — from application integration to content management to the workings of the online campus and more   student acquisition u us goal is not just to find applicants but to find the right students with the right requirements at the right time for the right program to do this we employ modern marketing strategies that help elite universities grow their reach without diluting their brands our machine learning investments provide us insight into prospects allowing us to spend economically and intelligently our recruiting service includes admissions support such as guiding prospects through the application process reviewing transcripts and facilitating live interviews   admissions  financial aid university all admissions and financial aid decisions are made by the university our university partners maintain high admissions standards for their online programs and are exclusively responsible for developing the programs admissions criteria and making admissions decisions the processing and handling of all financial aid is also the purview of our university partners these are not u programs but rather georgetown usc and northwestern programs   faculty instruction  academic services university every academic function that has traditionally been the province of universities remains the purview of u’s university partners u does not hire faculty to teach upowered programs nor do we provide academic services – and we never will in fact when we founded the company we called it tor but later changed the name because we felt it gave the impression that we provided instruction our university partners hire all faculty so when a student enrolls in a upowered program classes are taught by real berkeley or george washington or unc faculty why because these are berkeley or gw or unc programs and students earn a berkeley or gw or unc degree in addition all academic functions are handled by the university including academic advising program review and assessment grading awarding credit awarding degrees and program accreditation   student support u students in upowered programs are often juggling families and challenging careers as they complete their degree it’s not easy — which is why we offer more than just technical support each student in a u partner program is assigned a student support advisor who can offer  support and guidance throughout his or her journey u also offers career services to help ensure students and graduates achieve their desired career outcomes the career services team works with each university partner to provide integrated support and resources throughout the student life cycle and after graduation   faculty support  enrichment u us faculty training and engagement team prepares faculty to teach in the online environment we are responsible for the successful onboarding ongoing enrichment and continuous support for faculty in all u partner programs our goal is to empower faculty to maintain the highest quality learning environments to ensure maximum learning outcomes we support each live class with tech support but we also work oneonone with faculty to offer guidance on leveraging tools available through the online campus   realworld experiences u  university some disciplines simply cannot be taught without handson experiences from business global immersions to nursing oncampus intensives to social work field placements u provides resources and technology to support our partner universities in facilitating these experiences   placements u  university u’s placement specialists build relationships with sites coasttocoast so they can match each student with the right facultyapproved supervisor and experience the placement team finds and secures appropriate sites for students by vetting potential sites and supervisors collecting documentation and facilitating agreements to grow our placement network our team is fully engaged so students can complete their degree programs as planned preparing them for fulfilling and rewarding careers   immersion support u  university students in many upowered programs attend immersions in cities around the world hosted in international business centers like london mumbai and shanghai immersions offer students the chance to meet classmates and faculty in person and learn from business leaders these experiences can be lifechanging as students network with influential thinkers and engage in

and upward mobility at u we empower forwardthinking universities to reimagine education ensuring that students everywhere can dream bigger reach their highest potential and fulfill their aspirations through lifechanging educational experiences we help universities become the best possible digital versions of themselves so they can offer more students than ever access to transformative education u was founded in  when a small team began working on one big idea to build online degree programs as good as or better than traditional oncampus programs at top universities in the early days our work was met with skepticism it was believed then — and some believe it still — that an online program could never match the quality of education delivered on campus at u we believed — and still believe — that while higher education is changing rapidly universities that embrace the power of technology will uphold their missions and continue to grow at a scale never imagined we also believe great universities can and will continue to be the single most important catalyst for societal change our partners are creating a future where online students have the same rights and responsibilities as their oncampus counterparts we succeed because at our core we believe in this future from our executives to our marketing managers to our support counselors every u employee is united with our university partners in fulfilling the promise of education our philosophy one idea guides everything we do at u no back row® the idea that every person counts each person is and feels included and when we each lean in and do our part we are better individually and collectively this philosophy is fundamental to the learning experiences u creates with our partners and is at the core of the company we are building the eight guiding principles that drive our corporate culture derive from no back row as does our work with our university partners and with one another discover no back row
