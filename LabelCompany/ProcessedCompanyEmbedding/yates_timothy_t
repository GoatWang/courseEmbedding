gentlemen and welcome to monsters fourth quarter earnings call i will quickly review the results of the fourth quarter and then comment on what we have accomplished over the past year and what remains to be accomplished mark will focus on key operational priorities and mike will provide more detailed financial commentary turning to the quarter and all my percentage comparisons are at constant rates all elements of earnings and cash flow were consistent with our plans eps was  at the midpoint of our guidance range pro forma ebitda was  million and ebitda margin was  a basispoint improvement on a yearoveryear basis free cash flow was  million and we repurchased  million shares for  million bookings in core careers europe and apac were somewhat higher than our expectations while inquarter bookings in our core north american business were flattish and lower than our expectation but importantly significantly better than q we are not satisfied with our revenue in q a decrease of  on a sequential basis and each of us will provide color and address what we are doing to improve this result monster has made significant progress during the year  we are a much stronger company than we were a year ago on many scores on an earnings and cash flow basis this was a year of real progress for the full year we generated a  million of adjusted ebitda and  million of cash ebitda ebitda margins have substantially increased our net debt position went from a  million to  million and we have recommenced our share buyback program in addition to improved profitability and balance sheet strength were making concrete progress on executing our all the jobs all the people strategy but there is a lot more to do and the progress is not yet fully visible in our revenue i would like to squarely address the question which i believe we all ask what gives us the confidence that our strategy is working and why if our strategy is working is revenue lagging in addressing the question it is important to understand that while our strategy is working and i will provide you the reasons we believe it is it is not working as quickly as any of us would like there are several proof points that indicate we are gaining momentum first is the trend in bookings you know we have been digging out of the hole but the trend in our core careers business improved in  versus the prior year on a full year basis the bookings of our core european business were up  on a yearoveryear basis compared to a decrease of  in the prior year in north america inquarter bookings were essentially flat on a yearoveryear basis versus a decline in the prior year and there was substantial variance between channels in our staffing channel for example bookings on a yearoveryear basis are up over  for the full year staffing clients are known to be among the most sophisticated in the market in addition on a quarterly basis the trends in bookings in north america and europe improved relative to q and you will note this in the improving trend in deferred revenue which both mike and i will discuss later now a word on bookings we have historically provided bookings information because we have felt that they are a good indicator of the underlying business trends we are seeing but as our portfolio of products has evolved and changed we have struggled to provide useful and informative information on bookings this problem will be compounded by the shift to ppc ads which are not typically bought under a full year contract so while we believe that ppc ads will make us more competitive for many of our clients and will drive revenue and profit growth the shift will make trend analysis of bookings less valuable the information we are providing today is consistent with the disclosure we have provided over the past year and we look forward to talking with you in the quarter ahead about how we might best provide information on the trends in our business ultimately of course its all about revenue and cash flow second bookings of new strategic products continues to ramp during  total bookings for new products were  million compared to  million in  with the greatest adoption in our most important clients third as you know we are focused on selling software solutions in addition to our core advertising and search products in software solutions we include applicant tracking system monster cloud search talent gateway and talent fusion we conduct this business through our mgs and military channel and through a new group focused on selling those software solutions to our commercial clients since we established the group to focus on the commercial channel earlier in the year we have seen sequential quarterly progress although its still early as you know we have been actively repositioning our mgs military business over the past year from a peak in  the revenue and ebitda of this group has substantially declined in  as we enter  the backlog in the mgs military business has increased and we expect revenue and cash ebitda to increase during the year fourth kpis renewal rates new and winback clients and organic traffic are much improved from their trough a couple of years ago in europe where we made management changes at the beginning of the year kpis or renewal rates new and winback customers average spend per client are all flattish or slightly up in north america we had improvement earlier in the year and then again in the fourth quarter but a weak third quarter as we previously discussed as noted above kpis vary by channel the weakest performance on a yearoveryear basis from both a bookings and kpi point of view was in our transactional channels and in canada which was negatively influenced by macro concerns in their comments mark and mike will provide more information on the results by channel the critical point we want you to take away is that we have improved kpis and resultant bookings and revenue in europe and our business in europe is now growing in north america we have a diverse set of businesses and channels ranging from our newspaper partnerships to our staffing vertical from large enterprise clients to smb clients some of these are experiencing stronger kpis in growth while others are lagging and those that lag do so for different reasons which mark will address we believe that we have the ability to improve each of them or if we cant to find other alternatives for that piece of our business if they are not sufficiently profitable why then if we are making progress is it not yet showing in revenue increase there are several reasons first is the size of the hole we have been digging out of we started the year with  million less in deferred revenue than the prior year as a general rule of thumb  of opening deferred rolls into revenue in the subsequent year so in order to stay flat in revenue we would have needed to produce  million of new revenue in  and of course a multiple of that  million in incremental bookings so a minimum of  incremental bookings in  was necessary just to stay flat in revenue now looking at that going into  the situation is better deferred is  million lower coming into  compared to  million coming into  so we will have less of a headwind we are digging out of this hole not as fast as we would like but we are digging out mike will provide more details in his commentary second is channel mix as noted above we underperformed our expectation in those channels in which bookings convert most quickly to revenue third is price we experienced a decrease in average realized price in those channels which convert more quickly to revenue this decrease in price led to lower than anticipated bookings and thus to lower than anticipated revenue over the full year we saw a substantial increase in the volume of our traditional posting and resume products sold the increase in volume of units was more than commensurate with increases in the job market generally so clients were buying an increasing number of units however the increase in volume was almost completely offset by a decrease in average realized price we believe this resulted from newer competition which increased through the year mark will talk about the actions we are taking to combat this in summary our strategy is working and were having good success with our most important clients while the strategy was always conceived and communicated as a multiyear evolution it is taking longer to gain traction than anyone would like in executing this strategy we are building our capabilities for the longterm for example as we bring ppc to the market we want to make sure that we build it in a way which will allow us to ramp the product and provide significant value to our clients over the longterm we have the resources people money and management to stay the course and to become increasingly important to our clients of course this will result in increasing revenue and cash flow now id like to turn the call over to mark mark stoever  president and chief operating officer thank you tim and good morning  was a year of transition as we continued to execute our strategy for bringing together all the jobs and all the people throughout the year we launched exciting new products to complement and enhance our industryleading portfolio these products are all critical elements of the featurerich cuttingedge digital and social recruiting platform monster has designed to better connect people with jobs the transition to this new solutionoriented approach is a longterm endeavor that we believe will yield significant returns the recruiting landscape continues to be dynamic and increasingly fragmented employers have many choices of tools to find talent and consumers have many choices in where and how they find job opportunities we see this trend continuing and it further supports our belief we will become more competitive across key customer segments by offering variable solutions to meet differing customer needs we see evidence in the marketplace that such an approach will be superior to one based on narrowly defined hero products as we begin the new year we believe our strategy is working id like to share our key priorities and some exciting developments for how we will continue delivering against our strategic goals and improve our capability to meet customer needs we remain committed to innovative solutions to helping people around the world connect to jobs but first id like to comment on our fourth quarter results and the progress we made in the quarter as you heard from tim revenue from our new products continued to increase in the quarter and was up  sequentially and  yearoveryear in  we saw the number of clients using our new products triple in the us and more than double across europe these products now contribute  of the overall revenue for the company compared to  in the fourth quarter of  while were encouraged by this continued growth we do not think this represents the true or full impact that our new products will have on our revenue growth in the longer term we are confident our overall results will strengthen as we continue to grow the adoption of our new products while maintaining a focus on stabilizing and growing our core job advertising and candidate search capability momentum across europe continued and exceeded our expectations for the second consecutive quarter as you recall we successfully executed an expense reduction plan in the first half of the year as a part of improving profitability in europe and we managed to do so without disrupting our sales progress in fact this quarter is the first quarter in almost three years that our europe channels produced positive ebitda bookings were up  for the full year with the second half delivering  bookings from new products in europe grew  sequentially and  yearoveryear our new product offerings are helping us win new customers as well as retaining existing and winning back former clients this resulted in over  additional customers in the quarter in north america our fourth quarter performance remained mixed across the different channels bookings did strengthen in the quarter and were flat yearonyear an improvement over the decline we saw in third quarter we saw continued growth in the staffing and healthcare channels which were offset primarily by our transactional segments the small or midmarket smb and newspapers factors that caused the third quarter slowdown in our transactional businesses of smb and midmarket continued in the fourth quarter this included a less robust hiring environment which is typical for the season further the overall online job posting universe has changed with the rise of new aggressive players in the one employee to  employee size segment monster has maintained a solid performance compared to our traditional competitors however these new competitors continued to put pressure on our posting business in this segment beginning in the third quarter we put into place several initiatives designed to improve our competitive position and these efforts continued through the fourth quarter first we implemented a more concentrated coverage model focusing on those prospects with a higher propensity to convert to customers second as most of this segment is fulfilled through our ecommerce platform weve made several improvements to site flow and increased conversion including to the checkout process and our job posting wizard third we are testing a more flexible buying model a subscription plan which bundles multiple products is aggressively priced against competitive offerings and provides flexible buying with recurring monthly provisions in billing we believe this provides ample opportunities to increase market share by boosting diversified product usage from many of our customers in this segment who only use a single monster offering and lastly with regard to our newspaper channel monster recently renewed its exclusive relationship with the local media consortium a vehicle by which we conduct business with and through nearly  different media outlets and their sales forces prior to this renewal some publishers had moved away from the consortium which adversely impacted bookings throughout  we have been actively pursuing new publishers such as the recently announced partnership with the akron beacon journal we believe this segment will improve with this newly signed multiyear consortium agreement and look forward to working with the nations leading publishers as they use monster to continue their shifts from print into broader digital recruitment solutions turning to an update on traffic and consumer engagement im pleased to report that in the fourth quarter almost  million new members signed up for the monster services an increase of an  yearoveryear we continue to maintain more than  million jobs across monsters global job ad network creating a significant valuable resource for people actively seeking job opportunities in north america our organic traffic continues to grow and was up  yearoveryear this was driven by improvement in seo from the increased number of jobs from the all the jobs strategy as well as our ongoing marketing efforts and a renewed focus on developing unique original and useful content our consumer content such as advice and important related news has also helped increased job searches apply starts and new members weve established a number of key priorities for  all focused on revenue growth these priorities include first a continued rollout and expansion of the all the jobs and all the people strategy globally second we will improve the core business channels by improvement in our key seeker and employer site flows and maintaining our focus on improving job application and purchasing conversion rates third we will accelerate payperclick were accelerating the ramp of our payperclick ad platform in the fourth quarter we increased both the number of companies and the number of ads running throughout our job ad network were encouraged by the fact that many of the companies that tried our ppc platform for the first time continue to increase their campaign budgets with us this growth in customer budget is a positive indication of the value we are delivering for our customers and of the overall opportunity we see in programmatic job advertising ppc is a critical component of our job advertising strategy adding a new way to sell our ad inventory across all business channels it is equally critical that we deploy ppc in a focused and thoughtful manner and for that reason we have purposely managed the platform rollout in the first quarter of  we will focus on our agency channel a critical set of partners that we work with to resell the monster product portfolio throughout  we will be bringing ppc to all customer segments this platform offers customers the certainty of defined performance and monster will benefit from higher marginal rates and more efficient distribution of site traffic among ad content this allows us to deliver exactly what customers need and want whether that be duration based or performance based and fourth well be accelerating sales and productivity to drive revenue in north america we continue to top grade the talent and have implemented a number of channel specific operational and organizational initiatives designed to improve customer success and increase revenue today im also pleased to announce two significant initiatives that will increase our momentum provide additional value and create an even stronger reason for customers to turn to monster first the extension of monster social job ads to facebook in the united states monster social job ads is our programmatic job ad solution across social media channels taking job ads to the right people in a narrowly targeted way in our first iteration with twitter weve already seen great success by yearend  we had over  clients with more than  campaigns and now with facebook the power of our priority distribution and targeting capabilities has significantly greater reach monster social job ads on facebook is planned in other markets starting in the first quarter of  germany for instance will go live in march we will rollout the facebook platform to the other  markets which currently have monster social job ads over the coming months additionally as we work to grow and advance our core businesses with initiatives like payperclick social job ads and others a large part of our work has always been to increase the value proposition for both sets of our users job candidates and employers this morning we announced the formation of a joint venture with a company named kununu kununu a subsidiary of xing is the leading reviewbased employer branding and transparency platform in europe they maintain a platform for employer transparency through ratings and reviews and employment branding through company profiles our us focused jv will initially test the delivery of content rich employer reviews and ratings from current employees in canada and we expect this to contribute to our overall traffic and engagement strategy over time this information is designed to help inform consumers using the monster platform about the companies they might work for and deliver several new tools for the employers to better manage their talent brands including sellable branding and brand management products this effort is in its early stages and the formation of the jv is just the first step in our development of this part of the monster platform we expect this to be a profitable venture for us one which takes us into an adjacent space smartly with a knowledgeable partner to share technology and costs and one which leverages our core employment data on consumers and clients monster continues to deliver on its promise of connecting people around the world to job opportunities while we have much work to do it remains an incredibly exciting time for us as we ramp up our strategic initiatives and take full advantage of the opportunities as they present themselves ill now turn the call over to mike michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer thank you mark and good morning i will review our fourth quarter financial results and provide guidance for the first quarter of  before turning the call back to tim my comments will focus on our consolidated nongaap results results and comparisons exclude the operations of jobkorea which was sold in q and treated as a discontinued operation we recorded a pretax gain of  million or  million net of tax related to the sale in the current quarter slide five summarizes the fourth quarter proforma income statement our profitability metrics continued to improve in the fourth quarter eps was  at the midpoint of our guidance adjusted ebitda was  million up about  million sequentially with ebitda margin expanding to  representing a sequential improvement of  basis points and a yearoveryear improvement of  basis points q represented our sixth consecutive quarter of improvements on our key financial profitability metrics revenue for the quarter was  million down  sequentially on a constant currency basis and down  yearoveryear at constant rates operating expenses of  million decreased  yearoveryear and  sequentially at constant rates reflecting the benefits of the reallocate to accelerate program slide six summarizes the proforma adjustments during the quarter the  on the salary and related line represents stockbased compensation there was a  million impairment charge related to capitalized software costs as shown on the office and general line we incurred  million of costs related to the restructuring program consisting primarily of severance we exceeded our expectations of saving  million of cash expenses on an annual basis and will not incur any additional charges related to this program the  million adjustment within interest and other represents the noncash amortization of our debt discount associated with our convertible notes slide seven shows the nongaap expense trend currency had a  percentage point benefit on all expense captions on a yearoveryear basis and a minimal impact on a sequential basis salary and related expenses at  million decreased  yearoveryear and  on a sequential basis we ended the year with head count of  down  yearoveryear marketing expense was  million a  decreased yearoveryear and a  sequential reduction we continue to benefit from the increased organic traffic resulting from the all the jobs component of our strategy office and general expense was  million a  decrease yearoveryear and a  decrease sequentially slide eight is our nongaap segment performance revenue in our north american careers segment was  million down  sequentially and  yearoveryear this sequential revenue decline was driven by declines in our transactional business including newspapers and canada as discussed previously by mark and tim adjusted ebitda in careersnorth america was  million and the ebitda margin was a healthy  compared with  in q and  in last years fourth quarter on a constant currency basis revenue in international careers was virtually flat sequentially and down  yearoveryear revenue from europe was up  sequentially and flat yearoveryear at constant rates weve seen sequential revenue growth in lowtohigh singledigits in all key markets in europe due to strong bookings growth in the second half of  apac revenue was down in the lowsingle digits on a yearoveryear basis at constant rates careersinternational ebitda margins turned positive at  for the quarter representing a significant improvement both sequentially and yearoveryear this was the first time in almost three years that europe had positive ebitda margins slide nine takes us through cash flow and key balance sheet metrics adjusted ebitda was  million net cash provided by operating activities was  million at the high end of our guidance and includes approximately  million of cash severance payments capital expenditures were  million and free cash flow was  million deferred revenue was  million down from  million at the end of last year or  at constant rates this represents our lowest decline of deferred revenue in  as we continue to replenish our deferred balance total debt was  million net debt was  million total liquidity increased to  million and our leverage ratio decreased to  times in december  from  times in september  we are extremely pleased with the improvements in our balance sheet over the past year with total liquidity more than doubling providing us the financial flexibility to return capital to shareholders while supporting the strategic initiatives of the company we are happy to report that we returned  million of capital to our shareholders via our share repurchase program and we believe there is no better use of our capital than monster stock particularly at current valuations slide  summarizes our q  guidance we expect to generate  million to  million of cash flow from operations in the first quarter of  and capital expenditures are expected to be between the range of  million to  million we expect consolidated q revenue to be flat to up slightly on a sequential basis this revenue guidance assumes continued softness in the transactional space as we implement our plan to take back and gain share fx headwinds as well as the impact of the current macro environment we expect q expenses to be up  to  sequentially taking into account the normal seasonal increase in expenses from q to q nongaap eps is expected to be between  to  with that ill turn the call back to tim for his closing remarks timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director thank you mike  was a year of stabilization and improvement while data is hard to come by we believe we are stabilizing our market share against our traditional competitors results of those who have already reported confirm this belief we went from being liquidity and capital constrained to having substantial capital and liquidity we improved the profitability of our key businesses we have focused our management team and our culture and morale are greatly improved  will be a year of building on our accomplishments executing our all the jobs all the people strategy and attacking the market aggressively in wrapping up id like to squarely address another question i know you will have are we committed to  revenue growth for  and our  ebitda margin by q of  we know that the most important priority for monster in  is to grow revenue we believe you know we can control costs and that focus will certainly continue a point of revenue growth is considerably more valuable to us as shareholders at this time than an incremental point of margin growth especially since we have already significantly improved ebitda margins we are completely committed to revenue growth and our internal plans call for  revenue growth at constant rates in order to achieve this level of growth we will need to attain around  to  bookings growth in  this would be great progress in a market environment which is not expected to be robust because of the current uncertainty however we are guiding to a low to mid single digit revenue growth for the year turning to the ebitda margin part of the equation during  we largely focused on adjusted ebitda margin improvement while maintaining our core investment in sales and product as you know we met the ebitda margin we committed to earlier in the year we now feel there was an opportunity and a need to become more aggressive in the market we have built significant new capabilities under the umbrella of all the jobs and all the people these include social job ads talent fusion and the software solutions mentioned above these new products and features are supported by much more effective crm and a substantially improved organic content on our sites we are now adding ppc which is the final piece of the initial strategy we want to bring our capabilities to market more quickly and aggressively as a result we are going to shift our priorities somewhat from adjusted ebitda margin improvement to revenue growth and increasing dollars of cash ebitda cash ebitda is defined as operating income excluding depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation for  we expect significant increases in cash ebitda in the current environment we commit to generating between  million to  million of cash ebitda for  at the midpoint of the range this would be a  increase on a yearoveryear basis so our annual guidance for  is revenue increase in the lowtomid singledigits which can only result from significant increases in bookings and cash ebitda of between  million to  million this combination will result in top line growth additional flexibility to invest in our businesses and accelerate growth into  and beyond and a significant yearoveryear increase in cash flow in light of the likely increase in cash flow i want to end by updating our thinking on our capital allocation philosophy which remains largely as we have articulated each quarter over the past year we would like to make two refinements however first we may look at small technology or product acquisitions while there is nothing specifically planned today as we look at our product offerings there may be opportunity for us to add features or functionality better by buying rather than building we will only do so if its either cheaper or materially faster to buy versus build an example of this although a partnership not an acquisition is our exciting partnership with kununu and xing we are entering a very attractive adjacent space in a smart way were partnering with an expert in the field and the partnership is a good way to leverage monsters core capability and to provide additional benefits to our seekers and clients second it goes without saying that our primary use of capital is the monster stock we are driving to increase cash ebitda a great majority of which will be used to repurchase stock while we fully intend to remain well capitalized and liquid and while we will continue a base our buyback on free cash flow our board has authorized us to be more flexible in the timing of our implementation of that buyback in order to take advantage of the current market situation and we intend to aggressively use this flexibility id like to thank our associates and our shareholders for their continued support of monster as we build the company id now like to open the call for your questions questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session  the first question comes from kevin mcveigh of macquarie please go ahead kevin mcveigh  macquarie capital usa inc great thanks hey tim and mike thanks for all the color just one point of clarification on the low to mid singledigit revenue guidance for  is that constant currency or is that usd timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director constant currency kevin mcveigh  macquarie capital usa inc okay super timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director i know as i mentioned – and as i mentioned kevin that would require a multiple of that in bookings growth kevin mcveigh  macquarie capital usa inc yes timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director which then will make the situation better going into  kevin mcveigh  macquarie capital usa inc got it and then on the  million to  million cash ebitda tim very helpful whats the capex associated with that so we try to get a sense of where the free cash flow settle in  michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer yeah kevin this is mike mcguinness kevin mcveigh  macquarie capital usa inc hey mike michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer yeah hi we are thinking  million to  million a quarter of capex weve been on the lower end of that recently so if you annualize that about  million for the year kevin mcveigh  macquarie capital usa inc awesome thanks guys michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator the next question comes from randy reece of avondale partners please go ahead randle glenn reece  avondale partners llc good morning timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director good morning randy michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer good morning randy randle glenn reece  avondale partners llc i wanted to discuss the – just the concept of going into the payperclick space and what do you think youre going to gain from there and the potential that it could have an increased price pressure effect on your legacy business do you expect that business to be incremental or is it going to have some appeal to existing customers mark stoever  president and chief operating officer hi randy its mark ill take that i think we have said consistently that we do believe that this is an incremental opportunity for the business there is a large piece of the business out there that has over the last couple of years switched to a performance job ad program and so in many ways those customers dont exist within the monster or the traditional job services today so we are focused on going after that piece of the business first and foremost and there is a significant opportunity there to bring in new clients and new dollars to the company that being said as you know we have always been very careful on how we have thought about payperperformance because there was a lot to learn around what our durationbased postings do for our clients and we still remain of the belief that there are many valid reasons why durationbased postings worked very well and are very cost effective for many – many types of jobs in industries but have now recognized that to gain share and be more relevant to the broader marketplace we ought to have multiple options so we believe its a great opportunity its one of the last big pieces of the strategy rollout and as i said in my formal comments were going to be doing much more of it in  starting with our agency channel here in q randle glenn reece  avondale partners llc if we look at the sequential decline in revenue how much of that came from internet advertising  fees and government solutions michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer it was – it wasnt a significant piece of it randy it was – as we spoke about it – this is mike by the way as we spoke about it – the major components of it where the continued weakness in the transactional space we include newspapers in that because it is very transactional in nature and we continue to have some of the lingering effects from the sales force changes we made in the enterprise space but thats working itself through and we think most of thats behind us so minimal from an iaf and mgs perspective randle glenn reece  avondale partners llc all right very good thank you michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator the next question comes from mark marcon of baird please go ahead mark s marcon  robert w baird  co inc broker good morning and appreciate all the color and the good progress on the profitability can you talk a little bit about your us organic search visits just the trend there and what you would expect given the current level of investment that you have in place mark stoever  president and chief operating officer yeah mark its mark ill take that as well as weve been saying now one of the key elements of the all the jobs and all the people strategy is the ability to significantly expand the available content on the site because the belief there is not only does it provide a much better experience for our candidates because we provide many more opportunities for them but thats content thats good quality content that pick – gets picked up by the search engine so we have been watching closely what that has done with respect to – to our organic search traffic coming into the site and that has increased quarteroverquarter since the beginning of the year when we first rolled out all of the jobs and as you mark s marcon  robert w baird  co inc broker  mark stoever  president and chief operating officer it has organic search has mark s marcon  robert w baird  co inc broker im looking at slide four michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer q mark stoever  president and chief operating officer q you are looking at slide four which is year – q yearoveryear is up  and q mark s marcon  robert w baird  co inc broker im sorry i must be misinterpreting it im translating the slides to basically be the actual number of visits im looking at slide four of the presentation timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director yes yearoveryear mark stoever  president and chief operating officer yearoveryear youre looking at the yearoveryear slide i dont have it in front of me but the guys can show it to me michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer yearoveryear mark mark s marcon  robert w baird  co inc broker its not yearoveryear mark stoever  president and chief operating officer oh im sorry you may be looking at q which is the seasonality impact in fact if you go back through i think i mark s marcon  robert w baird  co inc broker im also looking at q of last year and its up a little bit relative to q of last year but mark stoever  president and chief operating officer yes its up  over last year and it came down from q only because of the seasonality that we typically have in overall traffic on the web from q to q and youll see that that has occurred in the previous years as well the other comment ill make is if you think about overall traffic to monster we have said that the strategy will allow us to offset a lot of the paid marketing that over the years we have had to use to acquire traffic obviously the shift from paid to unpaid is very helpful that continues to increase in terms of the overall traffic to the site much more unpaid traffic today and that channel organic search channel obviously doesnt just drive searches but it will drive quality job views and quality apply starts so its a very important metric that we believe is one of the key kpis for recognizing what the expansion of the job content is delivering operator the next question comes from george tong of piper jaffray please go ahead george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker hi thanks good morning tim you mentioned in the channels where bookings translate most quickly to revenue that mix somewhat underperformed expectations and that average realized price declined can you elaborate on these channels and strategies you have for reversing these trends timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director thats in the smaller channel in the ecomm itself for example by one posting it tends to get used right away so it converts right away the newspaper channels have a faster conversion and the smaller end of the smb space have a faster conversion than the typical average enterprise client or staffing client so its localized both the actual price competition as compounded by how that converts into revenue occurred in the lower end of the market mark why dont you refresh what the steps are were taking mark stoever  president and chief operating officer yes george i think when you think about what were seeing in that segment right these are very small ive characterized them as the employee size one to  as you look at the small business and midmarket there are multiple segments even within those so historically i think the way those customers bought there were fewer alternatives out there they all bought sort of similar products but as those segments have further become subsegments there have been opportunities for smaller competitive offerings to come out there youve probably heard a few of them and so were taking a much more focused approach at the individual subsegments of small business so the one to  for example weve recognized that theres been some opportunity to think about a differentiated solution this is a segment that has long purchased mostly a single product often just a single posting and while our site has always allowed them to purchase multiple products it hasnt really necessarily focused on overall lifetime value of that user so we have introduced a couple of things on the site not just to improve the overall site flows and conversion of new prospects but one of the more material initiatives was a new subscription service that is designed to increase product usage so we will recognize if youre a small business and recognize that if you have a greater hiring need than a single person in the coming months we will offer you a better packaged price with multiple products that deliver greater value to you and that is in testing right now it is only on a percentage of our new prospects that are coming to the site but we are seeing good conversions of that and its highlighting the fact that for this segment if you can be simpler in your packaging if you can price it aggressively if you can demonstrate that youre delivering greater value through the bundled portfolio it will create a longer lifecycle for these customers and it would become less transactional in nature so you can see on the site today weve got a couple of options mostly a threemonth subscription package but obviously as they increase to four months or five months or six more months the lifetime value of those individual customers increases significantly michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer yes and george this is mike again just to add in terms of the channel mix so if you think about the different channels we have so staffing in healthcare had really strong performances in the fourth quarter longer revenue conversions enterprise was flattish which was an improvement from q so were happy about the trajectory there but the declines were in the transactional space which convert to revenue quickly so thats kind of the mix and thats the reason why there was a impact on revenue for q timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director and its tim i would add a sort of more macro point on it over time there have been increases and decreases and ebbs and flows of new competitors who get very hot and then tend to stabilize we fully intend to compete in this sector of the market so long as its profitable which it is sufficiently profitable so we intend to be very aggressive in competing against this newer form of competition george k f tong  piper jaffray  co broker got it very helpful and tim can you also discuss from a  perspective how long do you expect it will take for bookings performance to translate in terms of revenue growth so the timing of a positive revenue inflection and what factors would cause the translation to be faster or slower from bookings revenue timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director the sooner we get the bookings the sooner well get revenues thats what i tell the guys but ill let mike answer the question michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer yes timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director more directly michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer yes george as we think about  and the revenue guidance of lowtomid single digits that would translate from a booking growth of as tim said of  to   and in q we are thinking midsingle digits and then it kind of expands from there and theres reasons for that as we introduce ppc into the market by now as mark said its mainly in the agency space but then were going to expand that to other verticals in the year we expect the positive trends internationally to continue as well the things were doing in the transactional space to remediate those issues as well were factoring that in the second quarter and then for sure growth in the third and fourth quarter and the continued stability in north america sales and so if you think of all that on top of the ramp of the other new products thats what gives us confidence that we can attain these bookings metrics that we have embedded in our  plan operator the next question comes from jeff silber of bmo please go ahead henry sou chien  bmo capital markets united states hey good morning its henry chien calling in for jeff timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director hey henry henry sou chien  bmo capital markets united states hey guys i appreciate the comments on the staffing and healthcare channels as well as the smb and newspaper i was wondering if you could remind us on the percentage of revenue mix between the different channels or however you look at your different segments thanks michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer yes henry no problem what ill call the transactional space which includes newspapers the lowerend midmarket and small businesses in about  to  of the business in north america enterprise is about  of the business in north america and staffing is about  to  and then healthcare is smaller than that but building quickly so these are all components that are sizable businesses for us and were working obviously to continue the growth in those spaces henry sou chien  bmo capital markets united states got it and the remaining percentage im assuming thats the new products michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer yes but in terms of verticals there is government in there henry sou chien  bmo capital markets united states right michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer thats a piece yes the big piece is government so thats kind of the delta as you get to the full na and this is full careersna henry sou chien  bmo capital markets united states okay got it okay thats helpful thank you and i wanted to ask about the comment of looking at buy or build or potentially acquire just wondering if you could put some color on what product areas youre looking at to potentially build or buy thank you michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer yes timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director go ahead mike michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer yes so i could take that i dont think were going to get specific henry you said wed do anything that can augment our strategy sort of tuckin acquisitions but we would only consider acquisitions that its economically better to buy rather than build and it would allow us to get into the market more rapidly so were not going to get any more specific than that but timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director in spite the fact that the guys will kick me under the table ill be a little bit more specific than they are michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer you can timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director im allowed to be look at some of the – we dont play – and i dont want you to go away thinking were going to going do it – but as i look at the areas of the job market which were not effectively covering you could look at something like the lower end of the market parttime gig economy as something where we should have an offering thats better than it is as we get more flexibility to expand the market so thats a space that i would think it might be worthwhile for us to consider something henry sou chien  bmo capital markets united states got it okay i appreciate that thanks a lot michael b mcguinness  executive vice president chief financial officer thanks henry timothy t yates  chief executive officer  director thanks henry operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to bob jones for any closing remarks

thank you very much good morning and welcome to monsters third quarter  conference call this morning im going to discuss our financial results and the progress we are making executing our new growth strategy james will then provide additional financial detail our eps outlook for the fourth quarter and further specifics on our recent debt refinancing we are encouraged by the early results we are seeing from the rollout of our new strategy we have started selling several new products in the us and have recently launched these same products in europe while still early pipelines are building nicely for each of the new products and there is excitement and energy from our customers we are executing on our job collection strategy and have already aggregated approximately  million jobs todate our candidate database rose by the day and is providing clients access to over  million candidates with approximately  million more yet to be commercialized and the sales force realignment which we implemented in the second quarter is complete and paying dividends in overall sales productivity i would like more to share on all of this later in my remarks but first let me address our quarterly results eps was  ebitda was  million revenue was  million revenue in north america was in line with our expectations our ecommerce staffing newspaper and recruitment media channels all experienced yearoveryear revenue growth and while we dont provide booking guidance i am happy to report that bookings activity in the quarter grew as you know bookings lead to revenue in subsequent quarters therefore in an effort to quantify the progress we are seeing with respect to the results of our new strategy including the benefit of the sales realignment i will say our bookings in the quarter have increased sequentially and have turned the corner for the first time in recent periods by growing at  yearoveryear in europe however the overall economy is weak with some countries doing better than others despite these ongoing economic challenges we are making measurable progress the sales realignment in europe is behind us our sales force is in place and our global sales team is energized and enthusiastic about our broad value proposition we continue to see gains in our uk business which was up  in revenue yearoveryear growth that was complemented by our performance in smaller countries like belgium and italy which delivered modest growth these gains were offset by declines in other areas such as germany and the netherlands overall europe was down  yearoveryear our korean business was up  yearoveryear driving our overall asia business up sequentially and yearoveryear by  in india there are some early signs of economic improvements our business in india was up sequentially but down yearoveryear as i mentioned we made substantial progress in the third quarter as we continue to execute on our new business strategy during the quarter we advanced towards our goal of connecting the worlds jobs to people everywhere we are continuing to make progress on multiple aspects of our plan to massively increase the scale of jobs to increase the scale of talents we can connect to those jobs and to increase the scale of the endtoend solutions for all types of customers in the us monster launched  new products that anchored the first phase of our broad strategy talentbin by monster monster twitter cards and monster crm we are now expanding geographically and launched these products into our top tier global markets of germany uk france canada the netherlands and sweden ill comment briefly on these initiatives now talentbin a major portion of our strategy is to expand the monster user base and create access to passive talent talentbin by monster allows recruiters to discover candidate profiles collected from the entire social web talentbin is initially focused on enabling access to technology talent and while we are encouraged by the robust pipelines which are building in this industry we are already expanding the focus to other professional verticals outside of technical recruiting for example we recently added design professionals who like technologists are in very high demand and talentbin can deliver the very best profiles available we offer unique features such as allowing candidates to include content from their portfolio as part of their portfolio we are excited about additional verticals planned for early next year with each new vertical we introduce  we expect to gain an additional pipeline for our new potential customers twitter cards and social advertising social recruitment continues to be a high priority for our customers seeking to reach passive candidates through social networks monster twitter cards automate the recruiters capability to reach candidates on twitter one of the largest and fastestgrowing social environments while still in early stages customers across all of our segments from the smallest company to the largest brands are seeing greater candidate flow from the use of monster twitter cards the automation of social advertising at scale is a large part of the monster growth strategy and monster twitter cards are just the beginning of delivering this service for clients we have recently signed on as a recognized partner of twitter in the api partnership program and are well underway with the development of powerful additional social advertising products job collection and aggregation lastly we have made significant progress in the notyetreleased jobaggregation component of our strategic plan we have doubled the volume of jobs on the network since our last quarterly call in august and now have more than  million jobs across the us in our toptier global market we expect this number to reach north of   of  million to  million in the middle of next year in early testing this expanded job content is proving to be a key enabler of user engagement and growth as users across the network engage with more job content at a higher rate before turning the call over to james id like to note that we have successfully completed our convertible debt offering and entered into a new credit facility with this new facility monster expands its credit from  million to  million and has secured a blended shorter and longerterm financing package at attractive rates given this heightened financial flexibility we believe monster is well positioned for the future now id like to turn the call over to james james james m langrock thank you sal and good morning slide  summarizes the third quarter  pro forma income statement eps was  which was above our guidance range of breakeven to  adjusted ebitda was  million led by careersnorth america which continues to record strong ebitda margins improving  this quarter revenue was  million slightly better than expected down  sequentially and  yearoveryear operating expense of  million was flat sequentially and increased  compared to the prior years third quarter currency had a minimal impact on operating income during the quarter interest and other was a negative  million equity gain was  careers minority interest was  million slide  summarize the quarters pro forma adjustments during the quarter we recorded  million of stockbased compensation expense while we expect stockbased compensation to range between  million and  million for the next  quarters we anticipate the expense for q  and beyond to be in the range of  million to  million per quarter the  og adjustment is a facilities charge related to updated sublease assumptions associated with the previously exited facility slide  shows operating expense trends salaryrelated expenses were at  million flat sequentially and up  on a yearoveryear basis the yearoveryear increase primarily relates to planned increases in quarterbearing headcount in anticipation of the rollout of our new strategy and salary expense associated with our recent acquisitions we ended the quarter with headcount of slightly over  flat sequentially and up  yearoveryear driven by headcount increases associated with our new strategy marketing expense was  million a decrease of  on sequential basis and a decrease of  on a yearoveryear basis we continue to drive quality applies for our customers while lowering our marketing spend office and general expense was  million an increase of  sequentially and flat on a yearoveryear basis slide  reviews nongaap segment performance revenue on our north american careers business was  million down  sequentially and down  yearoveryear adjusted ebitda was  million and ebitda margins were  revenue from our ecomm and newspaper verticals continue to produce highsingledigit increases our midmarket and large enterprise verticals were flattish and our government business was down yearoveryear we are pleased with the results that the q sales realignment are driving as sal mentioned north american bookings increased  with nearly all verticals increasing yearoveryear we believe this positive momentum will continue into our important q renewal season additionally while early we are extremely pleased with the results of the  new products launched in north america the sales numbers exceeded our expectations and the pipeline heading into the renewal season is solid and growing and most importantly early results are demonstrating that this is producing incremental business revenue in international careers segment was down  sequentially and  on a yearoveryear basis with revenue from europe down  sequentially and  yearoveryear the uk continues to do well with yearoveryear revenue increases however this was offset by decreases in germany and netherlands we continue to operate in a challenging macro environment in europe with certain countries doing well and others struggling while early we are extremely pleased with the initial results of the  new products we introduced in october in our tier  european countries apac revenue was up  on a sequential and yearoveryear basis driven by strong results in korea and improving results in india careersinternational ebitda margins were down slightly on a sequential basis we continue to believe that maintaining a current core structure in europe ahead of the new strategy is the right move to support improved future results however we are always looking at ways to cut costs and will not hesitate if we believe there are costcutting opportunities that will not negatively impact the rollout of our new strategy in europe revenue from our iaf segment was up  sequentially and down  yearoveryear adjusted ebitda was  million slide  is key balance sheet and cash flow items adjusted ebitda was  million in the third quarter net cash provided by operating activities was  million we have generated  million of cash flow from operations in the first  months of  compared to  million for all of  we expect to generate between  million and  million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter which would provide between  million to  million of cash flow from operations in  capital expenditures were  million deferred revenue was  million down  on sequential and yearoveryear basis deferred revenue was seasonally the lowest in the third quarter of each year as a reminder we are facing a tough yearoveryear comparison as last years third quarter had  large multiyear government contracts that rolled into deferred revenue this comparison as well as the negative effects of foreign currency drove our yearoveryear decrease total liquidity was  million this takes into consideration the new capital structure we closed in late october we repurchased  shares in the third quarter since the inception of the program in q  we have repurchased  million shares or  of our float we do not plan on repurchasing shares in the near term as we are focusing on executing our new strategy however we still have  million remaining on our current share repurchase program and well continue to evaluate the optimal use of our capital in the future i would like to summarize our new capital structure as i think its important that there is a complete understanding of our rationale our credit facility was set to expire in q of  our intention has always been to refinance in late september or october this plan was further supported by the recent turbulence in the markets and we felt it prudent to take advantage of an open window in the capital markets rather than wait until later in q or q prior to this refinancing our credit facility consisted of an  million term loan and a  million revolver with interest rates of libor plus  basis points working with our advisers we made a strategic decision to change our structure to decrease the amount of the existing credit facility and include some longerterm capital to diversify our capital structure accordingly on october  we completed a  million offering of a  convertible senior notes due in  which included the overallotment option this converted a year lowcoupon unsecured debt instrument with capped call protection and the option is settled in stock or cash all features meant to protect shareholder value and at the same time enhance flexibility we received net proceeds of  million after paying for the capped call and other transaction fees the notes will be converted in cash or stock at our option but our intention is to pay for the principal in cash the capped call provides  protection up to  and any amounts above  can also be settled with either cash or stock at monsters option in addition we have refinanced our existing credit facility and our new facility will have a  million term loan and  million revolver so in summary we have  million of year convertible debt a year  million term loan and a  million revolver slide  is our outlook for q fourth quarter  nongaap eps is expected to be in the range of  to  which excludes approximately  million of stockbased compensation and approximately  million of noncash debt discount amortization related to the convertible debt this guidance takes into account the expected fluctuations in currency exchange rates which will have an unfavorable impact on our reported results now ill turn the call back to sal for his concluding remarks salvatore iannuzzi thank you james we are encouraged by how our new strategy is gaining traction we have delivered several innovative products which will help all customers source talents at scale around the world we have introduced an improved gotomarket strategy designed to not only build a base of new customers in a much larger addressable market but also to increase demand overall from the existing client base in fact although still early we are seeing the new value proposition result in early  im sorry result in increased demand from our customers for both our new and existing products and many more products are to be released in the coming months we have built a very solid foundation and now we are executing on the new strategy from a position of strength and many more  and many of the difficult tasks and decisions are behind us our nearterm priorities are very clear and we are entirely concentrated on aggressively growing our customer base to focus sales execution therefore for personal reasons i believe the time is right to step down from my position as president and chief executive officer of monster and effective immediately i will assume the duties of director and nonexecutive chairman of the board im very pleased to announce tim yates will become chief executive officer as most of you know tim currently serves as a director of our board and for several years prior had served as executive vice president and chief financial officer of monster in addition as we continue to build the organizations capacity to further implement and execute our growth plan we are adding the role of chief operating officer to the management team i am equally pleased to announce mark stoever will assume this position reporting to tim mark as you know has been an executive officer of monster and an accomplished leader of several organizations and monster operating units most recently assisting me in steering the development and implementation of monsters new strategy id like to take this time to thank the management team and all associates of monster for their hard work and support and as nonexecutive chairman im very much looking forward to continuing my support of the board tim mark and the entire management team as we continue to grow the monster business and besides as owner of over  million shares its only prudent i continue to look after my investment also like to thank our shareholders global clients and entire employee database for their continued support timothy t yates you know sal im a pretty large shareholder too its tim yates for those i havent met personally and on behalf of the monster board i want to thank sal for his years of commitment and service to monster over the past  years a tremendous amount has been accomplished its really hard to single out just a few things but to note a couple of things which i look back on as being seminal sal successfully  in the early days successfully and expeditiously resolved the options backdating issue which could have been much more severe for the company he shepherded the company through the worst global recession in recent memory while continuing to make significant investments in the companys future these investments are now allowing the company to launch an exciting and an ambitious new strategy as both sal and james noted this morning you heard the strategy is beginning to gain traction mark and i and the entire management team are fully committed to bringing sals strategy to full implementation we will work tirelessly until we and the market see the strategys full potential as outlined in the recent investor day presentation we all wish sal the best of luck and of course we will be able to continue to rely on sal for his guidance and friendship in his new capacity as nonexecutive chairman for those ive met i look forward to meeting you again soon and for those ive not we will get together in the near future operator please open the call for questions now questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of glenn greene from oppenheimer glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc research division sal lots of luck salvatore iannuzzi thank you glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc research division i guess first question tim obviously im just not aware how engaged you have been recently in the last sort of through this new cycle in terms of the strategy is it fair to say youre still fully committed to the new strategy or sort of going to be doing an evaluation timothy t yates no the board and i  first of all ive been involved as a board member and also with the team and sal because of my history having been here perhaps more so i would say than a regular board member the board has been briefed substantially and frequently on the strategy and in great depth we do not plan to  were not going to revisit the strategy were fully committed to it the objective  the clear objective which sal articulated is to get the product into the market and deliver on the potential of the strategy salvatore iannuzzi because of my relationship with tim having been the cfo of the company previously and since leaving that post we have conferred often and deeply on the strategy i would say that he has very much helped to shape it and thats why the logic of turning it over to him should be seamless he has mark who has been instrumental in both formulating the strategy and also in its execution that i think that  it should be a very seamless transition in addition to that i am very close to the company i will be spending some time here certainly and so i think its coming together very nicely and please lets recall the rest of the management team that is all  all of it has been deeply involved in the strategy from inception they invented the strategy if you will and i think that theyre in a very strong position to execute and really a lot of the heavy lifting has been done now its  i wont say its easy i wish i could say that but its really a matter of us executing on selling it so i think were in excellent shape glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc research division okay i mean all my other questions sort of superseded by the news we just heard but i will ask one question maybe a sense for the north america book has drove i think you talked about the  yearoveryear could you give us a sense how much of the growth or the percentage of the north america bookings were from the new product just to get some idea what the uptake might be and obviously its early james m langrock so obviously it had a benefit glenn were not disclosing the amount it did have obviously benefit it did help the yearoveryear growth of  were not giving the exact amount of that glenn but the one thing i think is important is not only is it driving incremental growth of the new products but were also starting to see that its incremental business overall so its not just the new products were also seeing that the customers that are buying the new product are also buying more of the core so its a combination glenn were not giving the exact number obviously it did help but its also helping drive the core products as well operator our next question comes from the line of mark marcon from rw baird mark s marcon  robert w baird  co incorporated research division first of all tim welcome back mark congratulations sal wish you the best with regards to tweaks that might occur with regards to the strategy the execution of the strategy how should we think about those mark stoever i think  this is mark mark i think as sal and tim said i think we are  we have accomplished a lot and in fact we are in a very good place with respect to where we can focus at the moment its all about customer acquisition its all about the gotomarket and supporting our sales organizations around the world to present the new point of view the new value proposition to both as sal said not just our existing client base and the value we will create for them on top of the core business but a whole new market of customers and that takes a lot of work so there isnt the plan to sort of get away from the core strategy that was laid out back in may to all of you its all about now aggressively executing it to its full potential and as you know we are very committed and believe strongly that this has significant opportunity for all of us most importantly to shareholders mark s marcon  robert w baird  co incorporated research division great and then can we talk a little bit salvatore iannuzzi mark sal mark s marcon  robert w baird  co incorporated research division yes sal salvatore iannuzzi look i think that  i want to be clear on something that  and we as you might imagine before we made the announcement we did this morning we talked about this quite a bit the strategy i want to make sure that it is clearly understood my reasons for leaving the company are exactly what i said its personal okay so by definition i really dont want to get into it the strategy is what we laid out the strategy is taking off we see a lot of evidence of that and we dont want to overstate it at this point i think you know that we prefer to be more on the conservative side there is no dispute whatsoever between the board and myself or the management team with regard to the strategy we are all very much behind it in fact ill continue to assist anyway that i can i am not stepping away i think i will continue to be an employee of this company for a number of months to come okay to see that that strategy is executed so i  one message i want to send very clearly is that the strategy is solid the strategy is right everyone here is behind that strategy it is now  and i dont mean to minimize this in the least it is a question of execution of that strategy and i think were in a very good place to be able to do that so i just want to be as clear as i possibly can on that issue i understand the reasons for the question theyre logical but i want to put that one to bed timothy t yates mark the things that i would add to that is there are specific objectives and signposts laid out in the investor day presentation and one of the things sal would have done and we will do is as we update you well give you exactly where we stand on all of those signposts and objectives mark s marcon  robert w baird  co incorporated research division great and then with regards to capital allocation can you just discuss the logic with regards to pulling back on the buyback now that the stock is at its lowest price and now that you have longterm capital secured james m langrock so mark this is james one we returned  million already for the shareholders and we purchased  on those  million shares mark s marcon  robert w baird  co incorporated research division with a higher price james m langrock in fact an average price of  so we believe  the board and management continue to believe that its undervalued but right now in the short term we want to  were going to be focused on the execution and implementation of the strategy which we believe will transform the company and we still got  million remaining on the authorization so well continue to look at how to use that capital but right now in the near term we think its more prudent to focus more on the execution on the strategy operator your next question comes from the line of randy reece from avondale partners randle g reece  avondale partners llc research division sal sorry to hear you stepping out but im familiar with everybody that remains i have a question for mark i was wondering if i could hear your current state of what i would call job marketing it seems like your business is going far beyond the idea of the business that was extracted from the classified advertising industry and youre getting broader and broader in the concept of marketing jobs for employers and i would just like to hear you describe the challenges and opportunities now that you have been promoted mark stoever randy i think the way we look at it is as weve discussed previously the job  the old job board model is fundamentally shifted to a world of media right no longer are we expected to wall it all off and force people to come see those jobs its all about capitalizing on every candidate potentially thats out there whether theyre actively looking for a job or as id like to say poised for the right opportunity everybody is willing to look for that so our job as a company is to provide those innovative services that allow employers to reach these people wherever they may be and as you know the strategy calls for the broader distribution of these jobs beyond what weve currently done which by the way i think monster has done very well at distributing these jobs today things like the career ad network that continues to grow yearoveryear and is the largest media network of its kind in the world weve always done distribution i think where we go from here is capitalization of the social networks and doing things with  like youve seen the twitter cards roll out and the social ads that will follow from that its all about expansion of our distribution model and moving from the traditional sort of job board to really media and distribution of that media so were making great progress theres lots more to do ill continue to update you as tim says as we progress and hit those signposts but this is a very different company that is approaching this holistically and recognizing that companies need multiple solutions that get at things that traditionally they could not access so well stay focused on that and ill continue to report out as we make that progress randle g reece  avondale partners llc research division james sal said something positive about bookings in north america i was wondering if you could reconcile that with the decline in the deferred revenue this quarter james m langrock yes so if you look at the yearoveryear decrease randy as it relates to a couple of things first is in last year the q of  deferred revenue was benefited by  large government deals that rolled into deferred revenue they were not new contracts but based on our deferred revenue booking policy we were able to put  large government deals in deferred revenue last year there was the fx  there was an fx impact the dollar has strengthened against the euro so we had a negative impact of fx and also starting the quarter  we look at it from a yearoveryear basis starting the quarter coming into q of  we had  million less of deferred revenue starting the quarter so if you were to normalize for the fx the large government deals bookings  deferred revenue would actually would have been up on a yearoveryear basis on a sequential basis q is typically our lowest deferred revenue quarter due to seasonality so  and then also just another thing  i just want to announce that we were apparently awarded a washington state last quarter we had mentioned that we signed a large deal in florida a year deal with  option years weve signed another significant deal we still got to get the contract signed but were the apparent winner another good signpost that the solutions business is growing were now expanding from the federal government we now have ohio florida well hopefully soon have washington under the fold so again from a bookings perspective were very pleased with that so thats the  just some good news around the bookings and the solutions business operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of jeff silber from bmo capital markets jeffrey m silber  bmo capital markets us just wanted to get a little bit more color around your guidance for the fourth quarter i know you dont give specific revenue guidance but does it make sense considering how the bookings trends have been improving that we could see some sequential growth in revenues in north america in the fourth quarter james m langrock yes so jeff on a consolidated basis we would expect modest sequential revenue improvement that really coming from  in north america with the bookings performance in  we would expect a modest sequential improvement in north america into q international on a constantcurrency basis were going to expect to also be up modestly on a sequential basis but with the strengthening of the us dollar the international business would be  on an actual currency basis will be flattish to slightly down but on a constant currency it will be up modest sequentially and then iaf will be flattish as well so thats what id give you from a revenue standpoint expenses should be  would be flattish giveortake  million on either side of that jeff jeffrey m silber  bmo capital markets us and then the tax rate for the quarter james m langrock  jeffrey m silber  bmo capital markets us okay great and then you mentioned the foreign currency impact can you just remind us in your international business roughly where those revenues come from as a percentage basis james m langrock that  is coming from europe and about  from asia of the international piece jeff jeffrey m silber  bmo capital markets us yes no i understand and then just one more  a quick followup can you remind us of the timing of the future rollouts of some of your products mark stoever yes jeff its mark so most recently in the quarter we took the talent  the  core products that anchor the strategy talentbin the monster twitter cards and the talent crm products obviously throughout the us and then recently in the toptier european countries thats all in the market were now localizing   in  languages for the talentbin product for french and german and those well release within days and then our focus is on sort of what we have categorized as sort of the phase ii rollout which is  got  components to it the first being the further development of the social advertising strategy so we will release a much broader social ad product that capitalizes on the twitter work were doing and that will be first quarter of next year starting in january for north america followed by the toptier european markets probably  days after and then we move into the commercialization of the job aggregation strategy which will be introducing the job ad platform and some new ways in which we can offer some performancebased media products and thatll be again starting in q of next year through the midpart of next year operator your next question comes from the line of mark marcon from robert w baird mark s marcon  robert w baird  co incorporated research division can you talk a little bit about the marketing and promotions spend how youre thinking about that where the greater chances are for future efficiencies james m langrock so mark this is james we obviously look at that line closely weve gotten over the years  weve gotten had much more  the apply starts have been improving even with less marketing spend however if you look at the aggregation model in the longer term we believe that the aggregation of all the jobs and the content will have significant sco value over time so thats something that hopefully will gain some more efficiencies as we implement the aggregation have more content and the sco value that well be receiving over time will  hopefully will also drive down online spend ted gilvar mark its ted gilvar chief marketing officer just to add as well just remember that its down  were spending at  million and there was a time where we were spending  million a quarter and we are delivering same or better results for the money were spending mark s marcon  robert w baird  co incorporated research division thats precisely the point behind my question is it looks like youve made some good efficiency gains there and im just wondering if there is still further room to come james m langrock yes well what i would say is that with the  this is james mark with the aggregation and the additional sco value we believe that we could gain more efficiency at the online spend over time as the aggregation model takes hold and we have more job content mark s marcon  robert w baird  co incorporated research division great and then can you talk a little bit about which of the new solutions which you would expect to see the greatest nearterm benefit from mark stoever yes its mark again obviously the talentbin products  when we acquired that company early in the year they had a very small business but they were out there so unlike some of the work we have done with the gozaik acquisition which was all new development we had a bit of a head start so i would say talentbin clearly is off to a very good start the pipelines are very very strong and as sal said thats just in one vertical thats just in the technical recruiting so as you look across the market for other highdemand verticals where clients are trying to reach really the true path thats right ph people who are not out there actively looking that product provides some unique value beyond anything thats out there so were seeing very good early traction on that product followed by the twitter cards and then the communication tool that weve released within the crm portfolio so i look at it that way that will shift obviously as we continue to execute in the market but right now were seeing it sort of take shape that way mark s marcon  robert w baird  co incorporated research division great and then how should we think about iaf long term mark stoever yes i think the same way weve communicated there is  the way the consumer advertising business grows as you know is based on the growth in your audience so where we continue to see very good opportunity and upside for the iaf business is tied to the strategic component of the broader vision whereby were bringing in all of the additional traffic through the all the jobs component of the strategy as we do that there becomes more opportunity to hit those new users with products and services outside of jobs and we plan to do so lastly as we said part of the all the jobs strategy is to provide new experiences to the user base in the form of niche vertical sites so you know that we have launched  vertical sites in the us and we have now kicked off a couple of vertical sites in each of the toptier european markets those sites are designed entirely for a broader opportunity in the consumer advertising space so as those sites continue to get traction which will be over time because those will take time to build the organic traffic thats all new inventory thats all new ad placements and therefore while weve seen sort of flat a little bit  or  up sequentially since the first part of the year the real opportunity lies within the expansion of the inventory placement and the traffic that will come as we continue to progress against the strategy operator and this concludes the monster worldwide third quarter  earnings call thank you everyone for your
