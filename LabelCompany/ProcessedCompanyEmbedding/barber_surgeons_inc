märkisches museum berlin the barber surgeon is one of the most common european medical practitioners of the middle ages — generally charged with looking after soldiers during or after a battle in this era surgery was not generally conducted by physicians but by barbers who had a sharpbladed razor as an indispensable tool of their profession in the middle ages in europe barbers would be expected to do anything from cutting hair to amputating limbs mortality of surgery at the time was quite high due to loss of blood and infection doctors of the middle ages thought that taking blood would help cure the patient of sickness so the barber would apply leeches to the patient physicians tended to be academics working in universities and mostly dealt with patients as an observer or a consultant they considered surgery to be beneath them they often took up residence in castles where they also provided medical assistance to the wealthy contents  middle ages in europe  barbers in paris and italy  barbers in the british isles in the middle ages  in fiction  history  see also  further reading  references  external links middle ages in europeedit due to religious and sanitary monastic regulations monks had to maintain their tonsure the traditional baldness on the top of the head of catholic monks and be bled regularly this created a market for barbers because each monastery had to train or hire a barber they would perform bloodletting and other minor surgeries like pulling teeth or creating ointments the first barber surgeons to be recognized as such worked in monasteries around  ad because physicians performed surgery so rarely the middle ages saw a proliferation of barbers among other medical paraprofessionals including cataract couchers herniotomists lithotomists midwives and pig gelders in  bruno di longoburgo a physician who wrote on surgery was concerned about barbers performing phlebotomies and scarifications barbers in paris and italyedit in paris disputes between doctors led to the widespread patronage of barbers the college of st cosme had two levels of student doctors doctors who were given a long academic robe were permitted to perform surgeries and doctors who were given a short robe and had to pass a special examination before being given that license the shortrobed doctors were bitter because the longrobed physicians behaved pretentiously the shortrobed doctors of st cosme entered into an agreement with the barber surgeons of paris that they would offer the barber surgeons secret lessons on human anatomy as long as they swore to be dependents and supporters of the shortrobed physicians this secret deal existed from around the time of the founding of st cosme in  until  when the group of surgeon barbers asked for their own cadaver to perform their anatomical demonstrations in  the barber surgeons eventually recognized the physicians dominance in italy barbers were not as common the salerno medical school trained physicians to be competent surgeons as did the schools in bologna and padua in florence physicians and surgeons were separated but the florentine statute concerning the art of physicians and pharmacists in  gave barbers an inferior legal status compared to surgeons barbers in the british isles in the middle agesedit master john banisters anatomical tables with figures the paintings comprise a portrait of banister delivering a visceral lecture at the barbersurgeons hall monkwell street london c  formal recognition of their skills in england at least goes back to  when the fellowship of surgeons who existed as a distinct profession but were not doctorsphysicians for reasons including that as a trade they were trained by apprenticeship rather than academically merged with the company of barbers a london livery company to form the company of barbersurgeons however the trade was gradually put under pressure by the medical profession and in  the surgeons split from the barbers company which still exists to form the company of surgeons in  a royal charter was granted to this company and the royal college of surgeons in london came into being later it was renamed to cover all of england — equivalent colleges exist for scotland and ireland as well as many of the old uk colonies eg canada few traces of barbers links with the surgical side of the medical profession remain one is the traditional red and white barbers pole or a modified instrument from a blacksmith which is said to represent the blood and bandages associated with their older role another link is the british use of the title mr rather than dr by surgeons when they become qualified as surgeons by eg the award of an mrcs or frcs diploma this dates back to the days when surgeons did not have a university education let alone a doctorate this link with the past is retained despite the fact that all surgeons now have to gain a basic medical degree and doctorate as well as undergoing several more years training in surgery they no longer perform haircuts a task the barbers have retained in fictionedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this
