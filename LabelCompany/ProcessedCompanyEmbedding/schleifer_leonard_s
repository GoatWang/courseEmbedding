good morning to everyone and i echo michael’s sentiment here on the east coast i hope you are all safe from the storm  was an important and eventful year for regeneron and one where we achieved significant progress on the commercial research and development fronts we currently have eight late stage phase iii programs and a total of  product candidates in clinical development our science driven approach has remained unchanged as we look at  we remain confident that we are wellpositioned to reap the benefits of our longstanding scientific endeavors we expect to new major drug approvals in the united states this year first we are anticipating regulatory action in the united states at the end of march for dupilumab or dupixent our breakthrough il il blocker for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis we believe that if approved dupixent will change the way doctors are able to treat their moderate to severe atopic dermatitis patients secondly we expect regulatory action by the fda for sarilumab our il receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis we are happy to report that just last week sarilumab now also known by its brand name kevzara was approved by health canada strong preclinical data as well as our positive findings from our studies in atopic dermatitis asthma and nasal polyps indicate that il and il signaling is a key pathway driving many allergic conditions and diseases you will hear further details from george about our dupilumab development program we are keenly focused on ensuring that the anticipated dupixent launch in the atopic dermatitis indication is a success by all metrics i personally in addition to the teams at regeneron and sanofi have engaged in fruitful discussions with payers and we remain optimistic that dupixent the breakthrough product will receive good formulary coverage when approved for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis we will also be working rapidly to advance dupilumab in asthma and if the readout from the ongoing phase iii study is positive we anticipate making a us regulatory submission in the fourth quarter of this year combined with our other ongoing and planned studies of dupilumab in allergic diseases we believe that this product candidate has the potential to gain approval in multiple allergic disorders eylea remains an important product for the company and we continue to defend and extend the franchise by focusing on new indications like nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy and combination studies with ang bob terifay will discuss this further on the call for the full year  we expect us eylea net sales yearoveryear percentage growth to be in the single digits as we further diversify our product related revenues stream we do not plan to provide eylea product sales guidance after  turning to praluent this has been a terrific week for patients with high ldl cholesterol first the ldl hypothesis was validated for pcsk inhibitors with positive outcomes data reported by a competitor we look forward to completing our own outcome study towards the end of this year second just yesterday evening we were granted our request for a stay of the injunction pending the appeal praluent will continue to be available to patients in the united states meaning that patients and doctors will continue to be able to choose the best pcsk inhibitor for their needs including the use of a low  milligram option which only praluent provides we remain committed to ensuring that patients who can benefit from praluent will continue to have access to this innovative therapy as for the ongoing litigation we strongly believe that the controlling law and facts support our position that amgens asserted patent claims are invalid and we look forward to pursuing our appeal over the coming months finally before i turn this over to george i want to note that we have started to recognize students in our firstyear as sponsors of the yearold science talent search the most prestigious highschool talent competition as many of you know this program was previously sponsored by intel and before that by westinghouse over the last few weeks we were excited to recognize our first group of  regeneron science talent search scholars and  finalists we believe programs like this are essential to ensuring a strong science talent pipeline for generations to come with that i’d like to turn the call over to george george yancopoulos thank you len and a very good morning to everyone who was joined us today i’d like to begin with dupixent our il il blocker i share len’s excitement about this molecule and its potential use not only in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis but also in various other allergic conditions as len mentioned dupixent is on track towards the end of march for an expected regulatory approval in the united states for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults you will hear more about our ongoing launch preparations from bob terifay in the fourth order of  the marketing authorization application for dupixent in this indication was accepted for review by the european medicines agency or the ema dupixent has received breakthrough designation in both the adult and pediatric atopic dermatitis application in the latter we expect to initiate a phase iii study in adolescent patients between ages of  and  in the first quarter and in the second quarter another phase iii study in younger patients between the ages of six and  scientific evidence indicates that the il pathway is essential not just in atopic dermatitis but also in a wide spectrum of allergic diseases with that hypothesis were exploring the use of dupilumab in multiple allergic conditions let me begin with asthma positive data from our previously reported first pivotal study of dupilumab in persistent uncontrolled asthma which has also been published in the new england journal of medicine demonstrated that in all patients regardless of their allergic classification treatment with dupilumab resulted in improvement in both lung function as measured in fev and exacerbations in the overall population patients treated with the  milligram every other week dose had a  improvement over placebo in the fev measure and a   reduction in exacerbations the most common adverse event associated with treatment in this study was injection site reaction in our opinion efficacy in all comers rather than only in those with allergic classifications could be an important differentiating feature of the product profile particularly in a competitive indications such as asthma as a reminder the approved biologics in asthma are indicated only for patients with allergic classification our large second pivotal study liberty asthma quest a phase  study in adults and adolescent patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma is fully enrolled we expect to report topline data later this year with a regulatory submission to follow in the fourth quarter additionally in the first quarter of  we expect to initiate a phase  study of uncontrolled persistent asthma in pediatric patients between the ages of  and  following quickly behind the atopic dermatitis and asthma indications are additional indications for dupilumab these include nasal polyps where were currently enrolling patients in two separate phase  studies the next indication is eosinophilic esophagitis where we expect to report in the first half of  topline data from our phase  study we continue to explore the role of dupilumab in new indications and plan to initiative a phase  study of dupilumab in food allergies in the second half of  we are pleased with the advances in our late stage pipeline just last weeks sarilumab our il receptor antibody now known as kevzara was approved by health canada for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis kevzara is fillandfinish at sanofis facility in le trait france as we’ve mentioned before this facility is being inspected this quarter and subject to a successful completion of the inspection we plan to resubmit the bla for sarilumab to the fda in the first quarter with an expected twomonth review cycle our phase  ngf antibody program with fasinumab is also advancing and we along with our collaborator teva look forward to initiating additional phase iii studies in both osteoarthritis pain as well as the chronic lower back indication regn our program for respiratory syncytial virus is also moving ahead we expect the ongoing study to be completed by the end of the year moving now to eylea we are conducting two phase iii studies in eylea in combination with nesvacumab our antibody to ang both these studies one each in wet amd and in dme are fully enrolled the efficacy and safety data from both these studies will be analyzed at  weeks while there is greater preclinical support for ang compared to our pdgf program which we are no longer pursuing as we’ve mentioned before eylea sets a very high bar for efficacy in these disease indications we look forward to seeing the data from our phase ii studies with ang in the second half of this year panorama our phase iii study of eylea in patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macro edema continues to enroll patients turning now to praluent our pcsk antibody for lowering ldl cholesterol the odyssey outcomes trial our patient cardiovascular outcome study of praluent is ongoing this is an eventdriven study and we expect it to be completed by the end of  we expect that positive outcomes data will increase the uptake of pcsk antibodies in appropriate patients we are pleased with the progress that we’re making with our immunooncology portfolio regn our pd antibody continues to advance and we are currently enrolling patients in a potentially pivotal study in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in addition we also plan to initiate in the first of the year a clinical study in basal cell carcinoma beyond terminal cancers we plan to initiate in the first half of the year a clinical study for our pd antibody in nonsmall cell lung cancer our second checkpoint inhibitor regn an antibody to lag has also entered the clinic we will be studying it both as monotherapy as well as in combination with our pd antibody let me also update you on progress of our bispecific platform our lead program cd by cd antibody is currently in the clinic both as monotherapy and also in combination with our pd antibody we believe we now have a dosing schedule for the cd by cd bispecific antibody and look forward to expanding the number of patients treated with that dosing regimen lastly i am happy to report that regn our activin a antibody for the treatment of the rare disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive or fop is completing a phase i study in healthy volunteers and there we expect to begin a phase ii trial in fop patients later this year we also recently initiated a combination phase i trial in healthy volunteers of regeneron  with trevogrumab our antibody of gdf for skeletal muscle diseases before i turn over to bob terifay want to add my congratulations to the  regeneron scholars and  regeneron finalists in the science talent search but also add congratulations to every high school student who did a science project and applied these are scientific leaders of the future who we hope are going to change and save our world with that let me turn the call over to bob terifay robert terifay thank you george and good morning everyone fourth quarter us eylea or aflibercept net sales grew  yearoveryear net us eylea sales in the fourth quarter were  million and fullyear  sales were  billion net exus eylea sales in the fourth quarter were  million which represents  growth yearoveryear unadjusted for currency fluctuations net exus eylea fullyear  sales were  billion in  global net sales of eylea exceeded  billion eylea is the market leading product among fdaapproved antivegf agents for all of its approved indications in the united states eylea will continue to be a major revenue driver for regeneron over the years to come our quarteroverquarter eylea sales growth has slowed reflecting normal market dynamics for a more mature product that has been on the market for over five years with no price increase since launch we continue to focus our promotional efforts and the clinical efficacy and safety of eylea and our development efforts on potential new indications and new combinations the next potential driver for eylea growth could be an indication for nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy which is currently in phase iii development our fixed combination program for eylea and nesvacumab our angiopoietin  inhibitor is currently in phase ii clinical development turning now to praluent or alirocumab as reported by sanofi net sales in the fourth quarter were  million worldwide with the us accounting for  million of the total full year net sales were  million with the us accounting for  million we are pleased that the federal court has suspended the injunction on praluent sales marketing and manufacturing therefore we will continue our efforts to grow praluent sales and alleviate reimbursement roadblocks remember praluent is the only pcsk inhibitor that offers a lowdose option most of our sales are for the low dose  milligram dosage form outside of the united states praluent has proved in  countries reimbursement decisions by individual country region and institutional pricing and reimbursement authorities are gradually evolving we are currently preparing for the potential approval and launch of dupixent or dupilumab with an fda pdufa date of march   sanofi genzyme and regeneron have fully hired and trained our field teams at launch our field teams will call on  dermatologists and  allergist who currently comprise biologic therapies these are the physicians who will most likely be comfortable with prescribing a biologic for atopic dermatitis we estimate that approximately  atopic dermatitis patients have exhausted all approved therapies and have failed or are unable to tolerate unapproved use of immunosuppressant therapies we have been working with payers to ensure that these patients have access to treatment as len mentioned our discussions with payers are proceeding well and were optimistic that we can work productively to ensure that patients get appropriate and rapid access to this breakthrough product after approval in anticipation of early demand we have established a reimbursement access services and patient support center which will be ready to help patients from day one of launch our precommercialization efforts have been focused on educating physicians patients and payers on the unmet medical need in moderatetosevere uncontrolled atopic dermatitis it’s devastating impact on patients’ lives and the role of chronic underlying systemic inflammation as etiology this unbranded education has been provided at major medical meetings through digital media and through print media our launch materials and programs are preliminarily prepared pending approval and receipt of our final label we filed a regulatory application for dupixent in the eu in the fourth quarter of  pending a favorable inspection in the first quarter of  of sanafi’s fillandfinish facility in le trait france we intend to quickly refile our kevzara or sarilumab bla with the fda with the potential approval in the second quarter of  sanofi genzyme and regeneron have hired and trained our filed teams who will call on over  rheumatologists responsible for the vast majority of biologics prescriptions for rheumatoid arthritis as with dupixent we have also been working with payers to ensure that patients have access to kevzara and we have established a reimbursement access services and patient support center pending regulatory approval our precommercialization efforts have been focused on demonstrating the central role of interleukin in rheumatoid arthritis to rheumatologists our preparation for a potential launch is in place pending approval and final labeling kevzara achieved its first approval in canada earlier in  the european marketing authorization application or maa for kevzara is currently under review by the ema with a potential decision on the application expected in mid with that let me turn the call over to our chief financial officer bob landry robert landry thanks bob and good morning to everyone overall we delivered solid fourth quarter financial results in the fourth quarter of  we earned  per diluted share from nongaap net income of  million for the full year  we earned  per diluted share from nongaap net income of  billion this represents a yearoveryear increase in nongaap diluted eps and net income of  and  respectively for the fourth quarter and a yearoveryear increase in nongaap diluted eps and net income of  and  respectively for the fullyear  regeneron’s fourth quarter and full year  nongaap net income primarily excludes noncash sharebased compensation expense and includes the income tax effect of nongaap reconciling items a full reconciliation of gaap to nongaap earnings is set forth in our earnings release all of the financial guidance mentioned on this call today and in our fourth quarter  earnings release issued earlier this morning assumes that praluent will remain on the market throughout  total revenues in the fourth quarter of  were  billion and  billion for the full year  which represented yearoveryear growth of  for the three months and  for the full year net product sales were  million in the fourth quarter of  and  billion for the full year  compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  and  billion for the full year of  eylea net product sales in the united states were  million in the fourth quarter of  and  billion for the full year of  compared to  million in the fourth order of  and  billion for the full year of  which represented an increase of  and  respectively during the fourth quarter of  eylea experienced a small increase in us distributor inventory levels as compared to the third quarter  yet remained within our normal one to twoweek targeted range additionally we experienced a slight increase in our eylea gross to net percentage as a result of an increase in the proportion of medicaid patients treated with eylea exus eylea sales were  million in the fourth quarter of  as compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  representing a  increase on a reported basis exus eylea sales for the fullyear  were  billion compared to  billion for  representing a  increase on a reported basis sales growth on an operational or constant currency basis were consistent with our reported sales growth in the fourth quarter of  regeneron recognized  million from our share of net profits from eylea sales outside the united states and  million for the full year of  total bayer collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter of  was  million and  million for the full year of  total sanofi collaboration revenue was  million for the fourth quarter of  and  million for the fullyear of  the sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of regeneron incurred rd expenses reimbursement of regeneron incurred commercialization related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies in the fourth quarter of  our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of praluent and precommercial activities and cost in connection with kevzara and dupixent was under  million and was a loss of  million for the fullyear  this can be found in table four of our earnings release netted within these losses were the global sales of praluent for the fourth quarter of  as recognized by our partner sanofi of  million and  million for the fullyear  turning now to expenses nongaap rd expenses were  million for the fourth quarter  and  billion for the fullyear our nongaap unreimbursed rd expense which is calculated as the total nongaap rd expenses less rd reimbursements from our collaborators was  million for the three months ended december   and  million for the fullyear of  our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed nongaap rd expenses i’d like to note that our nongaap unreimbursed rs expenses came in below our  guidance due to less spending than forecasted in our sarilumab and dupilumab programs and lower operating expenses than forecasted in our rensselaer manufacturing facility for  we’d like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for nongaap unreimbursed rd to be in the range of  million to  billion next nongaap sga expenses were  million for the fourth quarter of  and  million for the fullyear of  nongaap sga came in below  guidance largely due to lower than expected fourth quarter spending on praluent as well as the delayed kevzara launch we continue to expect nongaap sga expense in  to be in the range of  billion and  billion the increase in our forecasted  nongaap sga expense is primarily driven by the anticipated launches of kevzara and dupixent as well as an increase in commercialization related expenses for eylea sanofi reimbursement of regeneron commercialization related expenses a line item found within sanofi collaboration revenue was  million for the fourth quarter of  and  million for the full year of  we expect sanofi reimbursement of regeneron commercialization related expenses in  to be in the range of  million and  million turning now to taxes our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and fullyear  was approximately  and  respectively as compared to approximately  and  for the fourth quarter and fullyear  as a reminder due to the adoption of accounting standards update  the utilization of excess tax benefits in connection with employee exercises as stock options is now reflected in our effective tax rate these deductions as well as a change in geographic mix of earnings were the primarily drivers of the reduction in our effective tax rate in  as compared to  for the fullyear of  we are guiding our effective tax rate to be in the range of  to  from a cash flow and balance sheet perspective we ended the fourth quarter of  with cash and marketable securities of  billion our capital expenditures for the fullyear of  were  million as we enter  we expect our capital expenditure levels to be lower than the previous two years as is reflected in our  guidance of between  million and  million the principal driver of these forecasted lower capital expenditures is decrease spending on the renovation of our limerick manufacturing facility other  capital expenditures include the expansion of our laboratory space within our tarrytown new york facilities and expanding and renovating a portion of our manufacturing facilities at our rensselaer new york facility as highlighted in our thirdquarter  conference call we did take the opportunity in the fourth quarter of  to repurchase for  million all of our remaining outstanding warrants that we issued in  in connection with our convertible debt additionally our remaining outstanding convertible senior notes were settled on october   in total our full year  cash flow statement reflects the use of funds of  million in connection with the reduction of outstanding warrants and repayment of the convertible senior notes which will not recur in  additionally in december of  we entered into a purchase agreement with affiliates of biomed realty to purchase the properties located at our headquarters in tarrytown new york for  million we intend to finance this acquisition with new lease financing where we plan to assign some or all of our rights under the purchase agreement including the right to take titles to the facility to an affiliate of bank of america who will become the legal owner and lessor of the facility directly thereafter we expect to lease the facility from the lessor for five years with rental payments that are expected to be lower than those under our existing headquarters’ lease and immediately accretive to regeneron upon signing the lease at the end of those five years regeneron will have a few options including extending the lease terms purchasing the facility at a predetermined amount or selling the facility to a third party on behalf of the lessor this transaction is estimated to provide an average aftertax annual cash savings of  million during our fiveyear lease term and we expect to close this transaction in the first quarter of  the contemplated lease financing will not constitute indebtedness for the purposes of our unsecured revolving credit facility and therefore does not adversely impact our ability to borrow under the credit facility with that i’d like to turn the call back to michael michael aberman thanks bob operator we can now open the call for qa but i’d like to remind everybody to please limit yourselves to a single question to allow time for others to ask their questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions we are standing by for questions and our first question comes from terence flynn from goldman sachs your line is open terence terence flynn hi thanks for taking the question maybe just on the ang phase ii trials if you can remind us there if those are blinded or open label and then what’s the rationale to wait for the week data instead of reporting the week primary endpoint data thanks leonard schleifer well it’s a blinded trial it’s a single injection either with eylea alone or in various combination arms and we believe that the week data is going to provide us the best opportunity to really evaluate the value of adding angiopoietin to eylea and that’s how we’ve designed the study george yancopoulos i should add that primary endpoint is  weeks… terence flynn all right michael aberman next question operator and our next question comes from geoffrey porges from leerink partners your line is open geoff porges thank you very much so len you mentioned the weather in new york and i wanted to make sure that there wasnt any snow going on in this conference call so i have to ask you about the guidance for eylea so youre really guiding to a significant slowdown in  even compared to your growth trajectory in q could you talk a little bit about the puts and takes in that guidance particularly whether youre assuming any changes in reimbursement for medicare part b and secondly what is it that youre seeing in terms of the penetration particularly in the dme that suggests that the product’s reaching maturity now thanks leonard schleifer thanks geoff no slow at all let me just address the question  your question and generally about our guidance here first of all i remind you that this will be the last year that we do individual product guidance im not a big fan of being in the forecasting business we’re in the drug discovery development and optimization business and forecasting is always somewhat tenuous a lot of people have been concerned about how we get to the guidance and why is the range single digits which can be rather broad you have to remember we are a sciencedriven company and when you look at all of the errors in the estimates of things that can go into it such as market share anything that could happen in government policy negotiations our ability to hold off any growth of avastin any market forces that require increase gross to net when you put all of these puts and takes if you will it does become somewhat of a blizzard which obscures the landscape and its very difficult to feel comfortable that we can make  give you precision that you would like when there are too many estimates in there that when  that you could  when you put them all together the precision is just not there so it is the fifth year of this products weve grown rather substantial and we do think there’s growth also to still be had with new indications and also obviously growth outside united states with bayer but as the year goes on well see how this all plays out michael aberman next question operator and our next question comes from ronny gal from bernstein your line is open ronny gal good morning i’m going to ask one alternate in case you cannot answer the first one so the first one is in case you have the opinion from the court about the preliminary injunction can you just give us a bit of color about this particularly what was the appellate courts opinion about the likelihood of success on the merits now if you haven’t got the opinion yet i would ask you about the praluent trajectory and market share for  obviously some of your clients will be a bit worried about the potential final outcome should we expect you guys to begin to lose a little bit of share against repatha in that market leonard schleifer let me deal with the opinion the legal opinion i think that’s what you are asking related to the injunction by the way it was not a preliminary injunction it was a permanent injunction which is what you get at the end after a jury trial a preliminary injunction is something you might get before a jury trial which was not sought in this case we read the opinion which is available online i think you can probably find it linked to our press release and what the court said is that as is typical in all cases when they are determining whether to upset if you will or put a hold on an injunction that a lower court issued that they consider four factors and these factors the first factor relates to the question of whether youve made a strong showing of a likeliness to win on the underlying appeal and the second factor has to do with whether or not you will suffer irreparable harm if you don’t get this stay during the appeal and third factor has to do with how this affects the other party and the fourth factor has to do with how it affects the public from the way that we look at the actual opinion the court said that the first two of the factors are the most critical and that is whether regeneron and sanofi have made a strong showing of a likelihood of success in the merits and whether or not we would be irreparably harmed and they said based on the submissions and the papers that they felt that we met that standard and we were entitled to an injunction to be stayed so i think that’s all we know at this point now we are moving forward on a somewhat accelerated basis the briefing  our opening brief on the underlying appeal that the judges were talking about when they said whether we made a strong showing of our winning on the success that’s what they are talking about were going to now go try and win on the success on the merits i hope that answers your question michael aberman next question operator our next question comes from mark schoenebaum from evercore your line is open mark schoenebaum hey guys thanks a lot for taking my question thanks to michael manisha and len for all your help while i was out helping out the team i really appreciate it and len it’s great to hear your voice i thought i’d ask a bigpicture question hopefully i can get len fired up here president trump was quoted  it was his press secretary i think a couple days ago when he mentioned that he was clearly in favor of the government directly negotiating drug prices with drug manufacturers i’d love to hear your thoughts on this do you believe it what does it mean for the sector if it were implemented what do you think  what kind of impact would it have on drug prices if indeed it were implemented and more broadly what do you actually think is going to happen with all of this drug pricing stuff thanks a lot len leonard schleifer you’re welcome mark nice to hear your voice as well look i don’t have a particularly unique pipeline into what the president is thinking here we take him at his word for what he said that he thinks that the us is paying too much and is not negotiating i think as he gets deeper into the policies i think he is going to find that in fact that we do negotiate prices for medicare drugs we just do it with individual medicare carriers rather than one negotiator i think that my own perspective on this is that what’s going to happen here is a little bit more of a nuanced dialogue that says that the public is going to recognize and i think the president recognizes that this is a very very hard business innovating and discovering new drugs that can really change people’s lives either how long they live or what the quality of their life is  is something that’s extremely hard to do on the other hand it doesn’t do us any good to do all that if we can’t get these drugs to people who can actually afford them where i actually think that there will be some consensus in congress which is this is going to take congressional action i believe i think there will be some consensus in trying to deal with how much of the payments individuals are making for drugs the copays or coinsurances are really what i think most problematic for the people and that i think that people are beginning to recognize that the skin in the game that the government wanted for a lot of this has gone a little too far making it hard for people literally to get the drugs and i think some relief there will be forthcoming but at the end of the day the attention probably will be and its just my guess is on somehow setting standards that breakthrough drugs ought to be rewarded and price increases that are not  that are unrelated are uncoupled from innovation will be pushed back on anyway at the end of the day were going to have to figure out how to protect incentives through innovation and in  not matter what we think coming back now to regeneron i think regeneron is extremely wellpositioned because i think the winners and losers in our space will be those that are really viewed as the true innovators if you can come up with a product like dupixent hopefully which will be approved towards the end of this quarter where you can change peoples lives that is always going to get value for you so maybe ill just stop there and take the next question michael aberman next question operator our next question comes from ying huang from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open ying huang hi good morning thanks for taking my question i have a question on eylea should we assume that your market share in  in amd and dme will be relatively stable that’s how you come to the single digit guidance and then related to that novartis has a phase iii for rth that’s comparing a q month regimen to the q month for eylea i was wondering if you guys have any thought about that thank you leonard schleifer yeah im not going to get into the granular basis of how we came up with our assumptions ying because as i said you start to add them up and you wind up with lots of errors so it isn’t like one thing drove it versus another so well keep you posted on a retrospective basis how our market share is doing but predicting that its just  its very difficult george can address the novartis trial george yancopoulos right and we want to remind you that their study is really just intended to show that some percentage of their patients can get by with every three months dosing and weve already shown data that shows that a substantial number of our patients can also get by with three months dosing i think that neither they nor i are advocating three months dosing for every patient its just that theyre trying to produce data akin to ours which actually shows that a substantial number of patients can indeed get by with every threemonth dosing leonard schleifer yes and i will just say that look this is a hard business and when you load of the eye with a lot of drugs which is what theyre doing they are going to have to show that they don’t get inflammation they are going to have to show that you don’t get hypertension systemically which was seen in some of the earlier trials and you just dont know so we will have to wait and see and we will look at their data but as george said im not sure that the way that they have set up the trials will accomplish anything more than we’ve already have data for so we will see george yancopoulos and i think one brings up an important point i mean theyre trying to do it by putting in many many more molecules of their agent as compared to eylea and to get a rather similar efficacy bar and with that as len pointed out comes additional risks that they are going to have to show that they are not actually causing michael aberman okay next question operator our next question comes from chris raymond from raymond james your line is open chris chris raymond hey thanks for taking the questions so still a question for the sarilumab so assuming you guys get a timely us approval here some of the survey work has shown real traction for a kevzara especially in its subque format with  it looks like real impact on embryo and humira so at least my view sarilumab has pretty significant differentiation versus actemra and you have got this positive headtohead trial versus humira it’s more convenient administration etcetera so len as you even mentioned on this call youve been a pretty outspoken critic of pharma pricing and the tnf market has been one of more glaring examples of aggressive pricing practices and i know len you don’t want to talk about specific pricing strategies but you guys really struck i think a great note with the pricing decision on eylea would you say that the inflammatory biologics market allows a similar setup here for you to really make a statement or is that market different from the one that eylea launched into leonard schleifer chris in a word yes we think that the constant price increases and the magnitude of them are a reflection of several things one somewhat tone deafness on the people taking these huge increases and somewhat of complexities of the system about how all of these rebates work and i think some of this is being unwound so we do have sort of a threepart strategy if we get kepzara to market which we expect we will one is to provide it as a reasonable alternative to antitnf therapy either in firstline or after failures the second is to try and position it if we can as the preferred il agent based on the profile of the product we’ll have to see how doctors respond to that and by the way there is this growing market for monotherapy which i think as you mentioned we do have attractive data in so monotherapy  that is without methotrexate which is not the most wellliked drug to be frank  is a growing part of the market and the third part of our strategy is the one that you just referred to which is that there is an opportunity to come up with more responsible pricing that’s all that i should say at this point michael aberman next question operator our next question comes from robyn karnauskas from citigroup your line is open robyn karnauskas hi guys thank you for taking my question so i just want to ask another pricing question can you talk a little bit about if you’ve seen any pricing pushback in the us and europe and you did mention on pricing for  i can never pronounce it you talked about formulary  they will be positioned positively maybe talk about how you think about the lessons from pricing pcsk and where you might be getting your confidence in the positioning on the formulary for indiscernible leonard schleifer yeah so a good question robyn and thanks the pcsk story will be a case study and there are lots of views on this and the complexities in the context that they were launched following the hep c struggles that the payers and manufactures had makes that somewhat of a unique story combined with the fact that you had a market of pennies a day fabulous statins which really could serve a lot of the market obviously in our drug dupixent this is a whole different story first of all we have outcomes data now the outcomes data are the endpoints people’s skin and their itch is really a big deal are getting dramatically better and i think that  so when you’re starting with that that’s very important youre also going into a field which the fda has said its a breakthrough we think its a breakthrough i think my discussions with the payers their people think its a breakthrough and most importantly the patients and their doctors believe this is a breakthrough so that’s a whole different kettle of fish than when youre dealing with a drug for example a cholesterollowering drug where people are not even sure they want to have their cholesterol lowered or if it was any good to have their cholesterol lowered we believe it was of course but there was this pushback here with this drug people want this drug people need this drug i think that the data are remarkable consistent across all of our trials it really is a breakthrough so we have had very productive conversations meeting with payers who i think have been receptive to trying to not make is always so adversarial and look we have a role they have a role and we can spend a lot of time pointing fingers at each other like a lot of people do and farmers running around saying well the middleman has taking too much of it and the middleman is saying that the prices are too high and their patients are wondering what is hell is really going on or we can try and work together and come up with a breakthrough product that has responsible pricing and good solid formulary access without significant barriers to the right patients getting the drug i am an optimist and i base that optimism not just based on my genetic makeup but on the fact that ive actually had conversations with the most senior leaders of the most important payers and i have felt that weve gotten a very good reception to our approach so im really looking forward to telling you the details when we launch and to getting this product to patients michael aberman next question operator our next question comes from adnan butt from rbc capital markets your line is open leonard schleifer thanks adnan adnan butt hi thanks maybe for george based on  for nesvacumab based on either phase i or biology you mentioned the bar is high versus eylea but is the bar different than the bar you would have expected for pdgf george yancopoulos well i think that the preclinical data was just very weak for the pdgf class we had been working on that for  years and largely went into that program as a defense as try to  just in case somehow the anomalous early clinical data were proven to be true ang the data  the preclinical data is much stronger but as you said eylea poses such a high bar for efficacy that it’s a challenge for anything to improve it especially eylea does such a good job on things like retinal edema which is one of the major causes of reversible vision loss so were anxious to see testing the hypothesis in patients we think it’s worth going forward and testing it we hope for patients’ sake that it is going to make an improvement but like anything else i mean it’s a high bar and it’s going to be hard to actually beat it michael aberman great next question operator your next question comes from yatin suneja from suntrust your line is open yatin suneja good morning guys thank you for taking my question question is on praluent could you guys comment maybe on how the odyssey outcome trial might differentiate praluent versus repatha and then george you mentioned you expect increased uptick after positive data in appropriate patient could you maybe expand on that how do you view or how do you define that appropriate patient population thank you leonard schleifer right so it’s a little bit early to answer the question on how we are going to differentiate we know that the trials are slightly designed differently in different patient populations but we haven’t seen any data yet whatsoever all we have heard is topline data so we have to wait until we actually get our data and analyze carefully the data that’s been presented george you can comment george yancopoulos and just to remind you your patient population was a higher risk population postacute coronary syndrome type population so you might expect that these patients might have both a higher risk which is one reason why our study had less numbers of overall patients than the repatha study but also that you might have a different degree of benefit in these patients and that it might be represented in different components that comprised of various events of interest leonard schleifer in terms of appropriate questions  appropriate patients i think that was actually bob terifay who had mentioned that i think what he is saying is that we want people to be have the maximally tolerated statins before they go on to choose praluent to further lower their ldl assuming that they have the appropriate cardiovascular  atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in terms of getting more patients through the system i think this will be driven both by doctors there are obviously some doctors who have been waiting for outcomes and therefore and only using let’s say in their most severe patients with severe hypercholesterolemia but now i think that that may change so you might get more drive and more prescriptions coming through i also believe that with outcomes data the payers are not insensitive to the change in the science and they will evaluate this and think about the various barriers that are in place and i believe they may lessen some of those barriers to make it somewhat easier to get these prescriptions to go through george yancopoulos and there is one important thing though whenever we talk about differentiation from repatha we need to keep in mind that we are differentiated this is the only molecule that has a low dose option there are a large number of patients receiving that low dose option and a large number of physicians who prefer to start with that dose that is how we conducted the odyssey outcomes study yatin suneja yes thank you michael aberman okay michael next question operator and our next question comes from alethia young from credit suisse your line is open alethia young hey guys thanks for taking my question it seems like the fda has been kind of tough around manufacturing and stuff so i know you’ve sort of addressed some things with the indiscernible but maybe can you talk about how the breakthrough designation has helped with the dupixent and like kind of what are the remaining steps and how confident you feel about being on time for this approval leonard schleifer yeah i think the fda has been and should be tough about manufacturing we rely on our system  both selfregulated responsible manufacturers regulating their production and quality as well as thirdparty regulators the fda  to ensure the quality of our drugs we have no problem with that at all and i think that sanofi doesn’t either and they’ve worked hard now to improve and get that plant in an acceptable format we still have to go through the routine preapproval inspections  routine in the sense it’s not a routine inspection it’s routine in the sense that you have to have it before a drug is approved but we’ve been through those before as they have and we’re optimistic and we have worked very hard to get ready for that and expect that we should be able to get through that if we do we would expect an approval by the end of the year  the end of the quarter sorry and in terms of the breakthrough status actually that’s been very very very helpful i think it’s a terrific program that congress devised because it gets the focus of the people it gets the staffing on the project to move things along it gets you more access it gets your questions answered etcetera etcetera so i do think that is a good program and my perspective on it is they dont give that out so easily they have high standards and when you get it they do work well with you so no gripes from me im not one of those people when things dont go well i just blame the fda its just the opposite i want a test fda because i want a high bar and want a balanced and fair playing field but i want a high bar so that were just not in the if you will as i said the other day in the infomercial business and anything you can say is fine and doesnt matter whether the product actually works or not mike aberman next question we have time for one more question for those of you who dont get a question today i want to apologize we are in the office and we made an entry so please give us a call and well try to get you on in the next earnings call so this will be the last question operator our final question comes from cory kasimov from jpmorgan your line is open cory kasimov hi good morning guys thanks for taking my question and squeezing me in so relatively speaking how do you view the market opportunity for eylea in nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy compared to the products currently approved indications assuming of course you have positive phase iii data for that patient population thanks leonard schleifer yeah once again im glad you asked the question on the way you did on a relative basis the number of patients is substantially higher who have proliferative diabetic retinopathy as compared to those that have proliferative diabetic retinopathy with diabetic macular edema and so you open up a much larger group of patients who potentially could benefit from the drug of course this is sort of almost treating people who have yet to realize you’re treating people who have eye disease lots of eye disease but it hasnt affected their vision yet and so you have to convince them that to get an injection in the eye to protect their vision i think thats somewhat of an impediment but because  if you have strong data the numbers there are much much larger anyway so i think its a big opportunity on a relative basis let me just close by saying that for us we get it we know how important eylea is but we  and so were going to defend and try to extend that we also get how important it is to make our late stage pipeline a big commercial success and we have worked very very hard to get ready for what we think could be a game changing  and people like to use game changing breakthrough all that stuff but the truth of the matter is those kinds of products dont come along that often where george and his team are able to give us a weapon to address really almost put your finger on the control system for allergic diseases and do that in a way where you don’t have the immune system dysfunction that you do when you do that let’s say for type i immunologic disorders such as the antitnf which do great things if think about it when you control the antitnf part of the immune system you are able to come up with drugs that treated rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis psoriatic arthritis ankylosing spondylitis crohns disease now that’s pretty amazing but on the other hand it came with some risk on the other side of the immune system if you can control that the way dupixent seems to be able to do we might be able to have a drug that can address lots of allergic disorders not just the first one the way these are regulated and the way they can be promoted are only indications by indication but there are lots of indications here you can think of it as we have drug for atopic dermatitis we have a drug for potentially asthma a drug potentially for nasal polyps with chronic sinusitis potentially for food allergies eosinophilic esophagitis and so on and to be able to have that control okay without having the side effects profile that you get from the other side of the immune system the antitnfs i think its quite remarkable so we are extremely excited about that and where the science is taking us there and how the company can evolve from what are tremendous opportunities on that side of the equation and were not giving up obviously we think praluent obviously were are very pleased when that came out last evening and we are going to fight very hard to get our appeal successfully and to make that an important product as well and our pipeline with all the things in it in a tough pricing environment i think regeneron is really the place to be because you get innovation and innovation is something that will always generate value price increases are nice but if you can’t get them you better be able to innovate and that’s our sweet spot so maybe michael i
