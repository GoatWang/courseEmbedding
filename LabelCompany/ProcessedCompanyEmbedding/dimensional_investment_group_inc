fund family its based on the work of esteemed finance professors eugene fama and ken french known as the fama french three factor model that shows additional return can be achieved by weighting portfolios toward smaller and value companies dfa is celebrated for great performance but fund researcher morningstar gives the family mediocre performance ratings and these funds can only be purchased through an advisor meaning you get lower returns after advisor fees here are my findings and what they may mean to you morningstars average ratings morningstars famous five star rating system defines the average mutual fund as a three star rating remember that the average mutual fund underperforms its appropriate index so a three star fund is an underperformer morningstar categorizes  percent of assets within dfa funds into one of four asset classes and rates each dfa category as average between a dismal  star to a more respectable  star as shown here i took a weighted average of the four categories based on each asset class size and calculated a  average rating from morningstar this is in spite of having expense ratios that morningstar defines as very low by comparison vanguard funds average nearly  stars now before jumping to the conclusion that dfa has only performed average i looked at the morningstar overall performance versus the category average over the past five years between  and  dfa funds returned a total of  percent which bested the category average of the same asset classes by  percentage points granted these returns are before the advisor fees charged but the performance ratings should also be before any fee charged by those advisors since dfa funds are no load morningstars response i spoke to russel kinnel director of mutual fund research at morningstar about the paradox of dfa outperforming its peers yet getting only average star ratings kinnell noted the star ratings were based on past performance over a combination of three five and ten year periods he looked at the domestic stock ratings and pointed out several that over the five year period had below average performance versus the category average kinnel agreed that as a whole dfa had outperformed the category average during the five year period kinnel stated however that this wasnt true on a risk adjusted basis first dfa holds less cash than other active funds which increases volatility second dfa funds tend to be more volatile as they hold more smaller cap stocks than other funds in the same category for example the dfa us small cap fund dfstx holds stocks that average only  billion in market capitalization while the average for the category is nearly double at  billion the smaller companies have greater volatility and the morningstar performance is adjusted for this volatility dfa vice president weston wellington responded dimensional balanced strategies have outperformed morningstar model portfolios by an appreciable margin over the last  years so it does not appear that ratings are especially helpful in selecting the best performing funds he did note that dfa tends to tilt more heavily into small cap and value which could be consistent with morningstars average performance ratings adjusted for additional volatilitydfa vs vanguardif everyone indexedmy takethe extra return from dfa funds was never touted as a free lunch  only as compensation for taking on more risk  morningstar adjusted for this risk and found dfa returns only to be average  im a bit surprised however that they didnt beat the category average even adjusted for risk  thats because their lower than average expense ratios alone would have predicted above average riskadjusted returns  on thursday ill examine whether advisors timed dfa  funds poorly and lowered returns for investors   cbs interactive inc all rights reserved comment share tweet stumble email allan roth on twitter» allan s roth is the founder of wealth logic an hourly based
