affirms three cmbs classes of gsmsc ii eop global credit research   mar  approximately  billion of structured securities affected new york march    moodys investors service moodys affirmed the ratings of two pooled classes and one interestonly class of gs mortgage securities corporation ii commercial pass through certificates series eop moodys rating action is as follows cl a affirmed aaa sf previously on jun   definitive rating assigned aaa sf cl a affirmed aaa sf previously on jun   definitive rating assigned aaa sf cl x affirmed ba sf previously on feb   downgraded to ba sf ratings rationale the affirmations of the pooled classes are due to key parameters including moodys loan to value ltv ratio and moodys stressed debt service coverage ratio dscr remaining within acceptable ranges the rating of the interestonly classes is consistent with the expected credit performance of the referenced classes and thus is affirmed the loan benefits from a consistent cash flow derived from a portfolio of  office properties across the united states moodys is concerned about the enormity of this  billion loan that faces refinance in february  the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term from time to time moodys may if warranted change these expectations performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had anticipated when the related securities ratings were issued even so a deviation from the expected range will not necessarily result in a rating action nor does performance within expectations preclude such actions the decision to take or not take a rating action is dependent on an assessment of a range of factors including but not exclusively the performance metrics primary sources of assumption uncertainty are the extent of growth in the current macroeconomic environment given the weak pace of recovery and commercial real estate property markets commercial real estate property values are continuing to move in a modestly positive direction along with a rise in investment activity and stabilization in core property type performance limited new construction and moderate job growth have aided this improvement however a consistent upward trend will not be evident until the volume of investment activity steadily increases for a significant period nonperforming properties are cleared from the pipeline and fears of a euro area recession are abated the hotel sector is performing strongly with nine straight quarters of growth and the multifamily sector continues to show increases in demand with a growing renter base and declining home ownership recovery in the office sector continues at a measured pace with minimal additions to supply however office demand is closely tied to employment where growth remains slow and employers are considering decreases in the leased space per employee also primary urban markets are outperforming secondary suburban markets performance in the retail sector continues to be mixed with retail rents declining for the past four years weak demand for new space and lackluster sales driven by internet sales growth across all property sectors the availability of debt capital continues to improve with robust securitization activity of commercial real estate loans supported by a monetary policy of low interest rates moodys central global macroeconomic scenario calls for us gdp growth for  that is likely to remain close to  as the greater impetus from the us private sector is likely to broadly offset the drag on activity from more restrictive fiscal policy thereafter we expect the us economy to expand at a somewhat faster pace than is likely this year closer to its longrun average pace of growth risks to our forecasts remain skewed to the downside despite recent positive developments moodys believes that the three most immediate risks are i the risk of a deeper than currently expected recession in the euro area accompanied by deeper credit contraction potentially triggered by a further intensification of the sovereign debt crisis ii slowerthanexpected recovery in major emerging markets following the recent slowdown and iii an escalation of geopolitical tensions resulting in adverse economic developments the principal methodology used in this rating was moodys approach to rating cmbs large loansingle borrower transactions published in july  the methodology used in rating class x was moodys approach to rating structured finance interestonly securities published in february  please see the credit policy page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of these methodologies moodys review incorporated the use of the excelbased large loan model v  the large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted loan level proceeds derived from moodys loan level ltv ratios major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage loan structure property type and sponsorship these aggregated proceeds are then further adjusted for any pooling benefits associated with loan level diversity other concentrations and correlations the model incorporates the cmbs io calculator ver which uses the following inputs to calculate the proposed io rating based on the published methodology original and current bond ratings and credit assessments original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds the ios references within the transaction and io type corresponding to an io type as defined in the published methodology the calculator then returns a calculated io rating based on both a target and midpoint  for example a target rating basis for a baa sf rating is a  rating factor the midpoint rating basis for a baa sf rating is  ie the simple average of a baa sf rating factor of  and a ba sf rating factor of  if the calculated io rating factor is  the cmbs io calculator would provide both a baa sf and ba sf io indication for consideration by the rating committee moodys ratings are determined by a committee process that considers both quantitative and qualitative factors therefore the rating outcome may differ from the model output the rating action is a result of moodys ongoing surveillance of commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs transactions moodys monitors transactions on a monthly basis through a review utilizing most® moodys surveillance trends reports and remittance statements on a periodic basis moodys also performs a full transaction review that involves a rating committee and a press release moodys prior transaction review is summarized in a press release dated may   please see the ratings tab on the issuer

goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage and the limited cash out refinance in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan increasing its balanceit only makes sense to undertake a cashout refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage for example refinance with cash out conforming loans it is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing fannie mae and freddie mac for example require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans called “conforming” mortgages because they are considered riskier the added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully if for example a homeowner wishes to refinance a  mortgage and take an additional  cash out there may be no extra costs the new loan amount is less than  percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a  fico score for example on the other hand if the homeowner has a  fico and the new loan amount is  percent of the property value it would cost an extra  to borrow  in general cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high in the above example the added costs come to  percent of the amount borrowed if the homeowner were to take  cash out however the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure the chart below shows the added costs which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loantovalue ratio notice cash out is limited to  percent of the property value what is cashout refinancing a refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage the difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose calculate your cashout refi glossary terms ​ cashout refinancing a refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage the difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose ​ equity the difference between the fair market value of an asset like a home and the amount of debt against that asset like a mortgage balance ​ rate and term refinancing a mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal ​ refinance refinancing means replacing one loan with

interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing because it’s a first mortgage the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans which are usually second mortgages the interest may be taxdeductible check with a tax pro cashout refinance cons underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance not just the amount of cash out cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal unsecured loan increasing the loantovalue to over  percent requires mortgage insurance alternatives to cashout refinancing homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan if terms of existing loan can be bettered adding just a home equity loan if existing loan cannot be improved taking a personal loan if credit rating is good and costs are low consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements however homeowners should run
