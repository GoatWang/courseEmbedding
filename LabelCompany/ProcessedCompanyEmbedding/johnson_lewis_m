final of the men’s  metres at those olympics is certainly the most infamous in the history of athletics and more indelibly etched into the consciousness of the sport the olympics and a global audience of millions than any other athletics event before or since ben johnson’s worldrecord time of  seconds – as thrilling as it was – was the beginning rather than the end of the story following the race johnson tested positive news that generated as many – if not more – shockwaves as his fastest ever run he was stripped of the title lewis was awarded the gold medal linford christie the silver and calvin smith the bronze more than two decades on the story still hadn’t ended in  lewis was named sportsman of the century by the ioc and olympian of the century by sports illustrated yet his reputation was damaged by revelations that he too used performanceenhancing drugs and tested positive prior to the seoul olympics christie also tested positive in seoul but his explanation that the banned substance had been in ginseng tea was accepted smith now a lecturer in english literature at a florida university was the only athlete in the top five whose reputation remains unblemished – the others all tested positive at some stage in their careers containing remarkable new revelations this book uses witness interviews – with johnson lewis and smith among others – to reconstruct the buildup to the race the race itself and the fallout when news of johnson’s positive test broke and he was forced into hiding it also examines the rivalry of the two favourites going into it and puts the race in a historical context examining its continuing relevance on the sport today where every new record elicits scepticism wwwrunneruniversecom reviews there are no reviews yet be the first to
