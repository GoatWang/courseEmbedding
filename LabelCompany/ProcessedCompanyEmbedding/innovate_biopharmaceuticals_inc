smrcp secretinmagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography mrcp has been used for more than  years as a noninvasive tool for imaging pancreatic ducts with the addition of secretin pancreatic secretions are increased leading to significantly improved visualization of the pancreatic ducts for detection of abnormalities including pancreatic cancer the gold standard for pancreatic duct imaging had been ercp an expensive and invasive procedure with complications such as pancreatitis  bleeding  perforation  infection  and death  more than a halfmillion ercp procedures are performed annually in the us and as the role of ercp diminishes for screening it will further the need for approval of secretin for smrcp secretin is a  amino acid long hormone which rapidly stimulates release of pancreatic secretions thus improving visualization of the pancreatic ducts during imaging procedures secretin has also been tested in a variety of central nervous system conditions such as autism though

larazotide acetate is a novel agent that belongs to a new class of drugs called tight junction regulators tight junctions which are located in the bowel should remain closed except to shed dead cells however in patients with celiac disease the presence of gluten causes the tight junctions to remain open thus starting an inflammatory cascade within the bowel that eventually destroys the intestinal villa early research suggests larazotide acetate may help keep the tight junctions closed when ingested prior to a meal thus reducing the inflammatory process in response to gluten  celiac disease

disease   background mechanism diagnosis treatment resources   celiac disease ced is one of the most common autoimmune disorders affecting  of the population in the united states and europe  million and  million people respectively and approximately  million individuals worldwide ced is emerging as a significant public health concern as it is associated with increased comorbidities and mortality and has dramatically increased in prevalence during the past  years currently there are no pharmacologic therapies available to treat this disease the only management for ced is to follow a glutenfree diet by eliminating foods that contain gluten unfortunately the ability to maintain a strict glutenfree diet can be difficult as many ced patients reported being either accidentally or purposefully exposed to glutenladen foods for patients who do adhere to a strict glutenfree diet up to  percent respond poorly for these patients therapeutic modalities beyond dietary modification would be beneficial celiac disease is a tcell mediated autoimmune disease of the small bowel triggered by the ingestion of glutencontaining grains eg wheat barley and rye in genetically susceptible individuals ced is one of the few autoimmune disorders in which all the elements of autoimmunity are understood the triggering environmental factor gluteningliadin the active fractions of gluten the route of passage into the body the mucosa of the small intestine a close genetic association with hla genes dq or dq and a highly specific humoral autoimmune response autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase antittg deamidated gliadin peptides dgp and endomysium ema while previously thought to be uncommon the prevalence of ced is approximately  of the general population the  nih consensus conference on ced confirmed that the prevalence in the united states alone is approximately  million people the number of diagnosed patients will increase dramatically during the latter half of this decade driven by broad based educational campaigns nih research funding and widely available blood screens for highly specific antibodies antittg dgp ema the disease is highly variable with many nonintestinal manifestations and is frequently characterized by some or all of the following chronic small bowel inflammation fatty stools and malabsorption osteoporosis anemia occurrence of other autoimmune diseases neurological disorders and gastrointestinal cancers symptoms may include chronic diarrhea abdominal pain muscle cramps irritability and painful skin rashes celiac disease patients that do not eliminate dietary gluten increase their chances of other diseases such as concurrent autoimmune diseases and a  fold increase in gastrointestinal cancer celiac disease often presents with vague nongastrointestinal symptoms during the active phase characteristic autoantibodies recognizing ttg deamidated gliadin peptides and endomysium are produced early in the disease the tight junctions are opened and severe intestinal damage ensues a biopsy of the small intestine combined with autoantibody and antittg blood test is the most accurate way to diagnose the illness there is no cure for celiac disease and complete elimination of dietary gluten with a glutenfree diet is the only management of the disease for most patients strict dietary avoidance may heal the small intestine within  to  months and reduce the markers of autoimmunity antittg dgp and ema several organizations have been formed to help patients meet the challenge of complete gluten avoidance it is known that altered intestinal permeability leaky gut is a hallmark of ced and tracks the severity of the disease it is likely that leaky gut is both a cause and a consequence of the disease facilitating transport of gluten which then triggers an inflammatory process resulting in tight junction dysfunction leak which can be blocked by tight junction regulation mechanism intestinal tight junctions control the passage of large molecules such as intact proteins particles and cells through the paracellular space this passive transport is known as intestinal paracellular permeability and while it accounts for only  percent of total protein uptake it serves as the major portal for intact protein and antigen delivery into the body protein entry is in close proximity to the submucosal lymphocytes which comprise  percent of immunoglobulin producing cells in the human body increased intestinal paracellular permeability leads to antigen presentation for processing and antibody response tight junctions in other organs have a similar function the regulation of paracellular transport in the capillary endothelia of the blood brain barrier tight junctions are the anatomical barrier interfacing blood and cns tight junction dysfunction has been implicated in a host of disease states including a variety of autoimmune diseases ischemia  reperfusion injury also appears to be associated with tight junction dysfunction while many cytokines bacterial toxins infections and drugs have also been implicated in tight junction injury or destruction
