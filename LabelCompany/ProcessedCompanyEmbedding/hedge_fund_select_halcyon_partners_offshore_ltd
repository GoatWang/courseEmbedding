with less money than is typically required goldman sachs has added three funds to its hedge fund select platform which allows its clients to invest in wellregarded and in some cases brandname hedge funds with much lower minimums than the underlying fund would charge the investment bank disclosed in separate filings tuesday that it has launched hedge fund select halcyon partners offshore hedge fund select dymon asia macro fund and hedge fund select corsair capital investors flagship fund this brings to  the number of funds it has introduced under this format since last september other funds on the platform include those run by alan howard’s londonbased brevan howard asset management barry rosenstein’s new yorkbased jana partners and paul tudor jones ii’s greenwich connecticutbased tudor investment corp goldman only requires hedge fund select investors to plunk down  for each of the funds compared with a minimum of  million to  million typically required by the underlying firms however there is a catch a client must have at least  million invested with goldman altogether having goldman’s imprimatur however does not guarantee superior performance many of the underlying funds that goldman is offering to its clients have produced mediocre performance of late for example the brevan howard multistrategy fund was down  percent through august after rising just  percent in  the dymon asia macro fund run by singaporebased dymon asia capital lost nearly  percent in september and is now up just  percent for the first nine months it rose less than  percent last year to be fair the fund was up a stellar  percent in  and  percent in  david chan who last year joined dymon asia as chief executive officer was previously the head of macro trading at goldman in asia firm founder
