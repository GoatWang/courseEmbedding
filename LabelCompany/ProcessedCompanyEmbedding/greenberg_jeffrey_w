americas most powerful people  and  address marsh  mclennan companies  avenue of the americas new york new york  httpwwwmmccom ■ jeffrey greenberg spent most of his early career under the wing of his father maurice hank greenberg head of american international group aig after nearly two decades he surprisingly left aig and joined marsh  mclennan companies mmc a global insurance investment and consulting company within a few years he was named the companys chairman and chief executive officer ceo greenberg led aig through several tumultuous events including the loss of hundreds of employees in the september   attacks on the world trade center he also steered aig through an investment scandal at putnam investments one of mmcs subsidiary companies greenberg was described as a smart and competent executive who tended to avoid the spotlight jeffrey w greenberg  jim bourgreuters newmedia inccorbis  following in his fathers footsteps jeffrey greenberg grew up in a privileged environment but he did not want to be a stereotypical rich kid as a teenager he took jobs pumping gas and bagging groceries at a local supermarket although he reportedly used the proceeds to buy an alfa romeo sports car his former wife nikki finke described greenberg as a dutiful son after graduating from brown university and georgetown university law school he took a job as a broker at mmc where he quickly became known for his intelligence and hard work i think he could have succeeded in any business michael p esposito a longtime business associate told businessweek  greenberg left mmc after two years to join his fathers company in  he was made head of aigs propertycasualty division the national union fire insurance company three years later he was named executive vice president of domestic brokerage operations the insurance products he helped develop enabled aigs customers to protect themselves against a wide variety of potential problems from severe weather to currency fluctuations while at aig greenberg adopted his fathers tough business style when hurricane andrew hit florida in  jeffrey greenberg is said to have sent out a memo supported by his father telling aig senior managers this is an opportunity to get price increases now  washington post  greenberg spent  years at aig and was expected to succeed his father as head of the company but in  he abruptly left his position as executive vice president just weeks after his brother evan was awarded the same title although jeffrey said he made the move because it would be fun to do something independent of aig  wall street journal  there was some speculation that evans rapid rise within the family business threatened jeffreys position as heir apparent other analysts suggested that jeffrey was tired of waiting for his fathers job though maurice was well past the age of retirement he showed no signs that he was ready to relinquish the top spot at aig still other people in the industry suggested that jeffrey felt strangled by his fathers tight rope at one point his father reportedly responded to a personnel problem in one of jeffreys divisions by saying you either fix your management problem or ill fix mine  washington post  but jeffrey denied that there was any strain in his relationship with his father some aig executives were saddened when jeffrey greenberg left the company and were concerned that his brother would not be able to fill his shoes he was a real creative force one highlevel manager said of jeffrey  businessweek  return to marsh  mclennan soon greenberg returned to mmc the move raised eyebrows because aig was one of mmcs primary sources of insurance coverage for its clients skeptics were concerned that greenberg would give preferential treatment to his fathers company choosing its policies over those of rival insurers greenberg was chairman of mmc capital from  until  in  at the age of  he became the youngest ceo in the companys year history at the helm he was charged with overseeing the three divisions of the multibilliondollar financialservices conglomerate marsh one of the worlds largest corporate risk and insurance brokers putnam investments and mercer consulting group within two years mmcs stock prices were up  percent and greenberg had lured top talent from companies such as pepsico and the union bank of switzerland to fill his management team associates described greenberg as an intellectual and analytical leader with a deliberate management style hes not a person who makes snap decisions michael a lewis an analyst at ubs investment research told the new york times  as ceo greenberg always kept a low profile making few public appearances and rarely hosting conference calls to announce quarterly earnings as was the practice of many of his rivals ceos difficult times for mmc the rosy period that greenberg enjoyed during his first few years at mmc did not last for long the economic downturn at the beginning of the st century hit mmcs stock price hard the company was also devastated by the events of september   mmc had  employees working in the upper floors of the world trade center and nearly  of them were killed when he heard news of the terrorist attack greenberg quickly established a command center at the companys headquarters in midtown manhattan he later arranged for grief counselors and other support for the families of those employees who had perished september  changed the business world significantly but for the insurance industry the repercussions were not all negative mmc took advantage of higher insurance rates and the increased demand for insurance that resulted from the attacks in  putnam investments one of mmcs divisions found itself embroiled in scandal civil charges were filed against the company for alleged trading abuses according to the securities and exchange commission putnams executives used insider information to profit from the international funds they managed at the expense of their clients within a few months after the story became public angry investors withdrew more than  billion from the company greenberg replaced putnam ceo lawrence lasser soon after the scandal broke in a move many thought reminiscent of his father i see this as an aggressive move that hopefully will address whatever problems they have and get them firmly back on track chris winans an insurance analyst at lehman brothers told the new york times  this is very much like his fathers approach to problems to address them quickly and forcefully although greenberg vowed to stick with putnam he was firm that the company would not stand for any sort of shady business practices we are taking measures to see that this does not happen again the kind of conduct that has occurred has no place at putnam he said in a statement  cfocom  he directed putnam investments mutualfund unit to pay millions of dollars in restitution to jilted investors greenberg also added independent directors and limited employee trading all in an effort to restore investor confidence while his company was struggling to regain its foothold in the investment industry greenbergs own finances were solid in  he pocketed approximately  million a hefty in crease from the previous year by the end of the year mmc was on better footing as well the company had a doubledigit revenue increase over the previous year fueled primarily by a strong performance by its risk and insurance businesses in  following the controversy over former chairman richard grassos  million compensation package greenberg was

events hotels movies museums  attractions spas  beauty services stores feature sins of the son in a corporate greek tragedy jeffrey greenberg tried desperately to escape the vast shadow of his insurancemogul father hank only to be smote by a more powerful god by noam scheiber sharethis photo illustration by charles miller the first thing you might notice about jeffrey greenberg is how modest and selfeffacing he can be particularly for a man who’s held a couple of the most important jobs in the insurance industry “jeff was very clever in his way playful” says mark reagan a fellow insurance executive who once worked for greenberg “you’d walk out of a tough meeting and jeff might say ‘that wasn’t as much fun as i hoped’ ” as a young man greenberg was the type who despite his family’s wealth insisted on pumping gas and scrubbing boats to pay off a new car even when he went on to earn  million last year greenberg lived with his second wife and four kids in a relatively unassuming apartment on park avenue before he became ceo of marsh  mclennan a job he held for five years before being forced to resign late last month greenberg had a reputation for stepping in to claim responsibility when higherups lashed out at his subordinates there is something almost cartoonishly allamerican about him at six feet tall greenberg has the build of a natural athlete he was in fact a standout sprinter football player and skier at choate as of last month the yearold greenberg remained one of the tougher tennis matchups on the executive circuit greenberg is also a textbook incarnation of corporate establishmentarianism he is a trustee at brown his alma mater at brookings the granddaddy of washington think tanks and at new york’s elite spence school which his eldest daughter attended greenberg would be perfectly at home in the halls of the council on foreign relations or at a meeting of the trilateral commission he’s a member of both institutions his family spends weekends at their house in northern connecticut but for all jeff greenberg’s obvious successes he’d never escaped the shadow of his largerthanlife family his father maurice r “hank” greenberg the ceo and chairman of aig is quite possibly the most famous man in the history of the insurance business hank almost singlehandedly built the company into a global financialservices powerhouse over the past  years at least since adolescence jeff has been dogged by the sense that nothing he could accomplish would amount to more than a footnote alongside the achievements of his father for his part hank whose management style former employees have compared to george patton’s did his best to remind jeff of this fact during the seventeenyear period he worked for his father at aig “do i think he was harsher because jeff was his son i think the answer is yes” says one former aig executive in one notorious incident hank blew up at jeff over a personnel problem in a roomful of colleagues “you either fix your management problem or i’ll fix mine” the father reportedly bellowed “i think it was a case of two people from the same gene pool with extraordinarily high success drives” says this executive “and there’s only so much oxygen in any given room” jeff greenberg’s whitecollar sensibility didn’t mean he refused to play hardball like his father hank or his brother evan it’s just that jeff wasn’t as good at it to further complicate the matter jeff was not the only greenberg son high up in the aig hierarchy toward the end of jeff’s time at aig his younger brother evan was head of the company’s international operations—and probably the only person who’d risen faster at aig than jeff the brothers had been lifelong rivals jeff had always been the good son—successful at school successful at work but never quite successful enough to impress hank evan by contrast had a knack for screwing up though he’d earned a special place in hank’s heart over the years for having the guts to defy him when evan began to prove himself jeff’s equal in the family business it was more than jeff could handle in june  the combination of this fraternal competition and his father’s suffocating management style led jeff to resign—and walk away from what many observers expected would be his eventual takeover of the company jeff greenberg landed at the giant insurance brokerage marsh  mclennan where within four years he rose to ceo it was a triumph confirmation that he was ultimately his own man then two weeks ago with the firm under fire from new york attorney general eliot spitzer jeff greenberg’s career came crashing down spitzer is accusing marsh  mclennan of rigging what were supposed to be competitive bids and collecting kickbacks from insurance companies in exchange for lucrative business watching jeff tender his resignation you could be forgiven for concluding he was just another greedy ceo getting his comeuppance but in fact it’s impossible to judge the story of jeff greenberg’s rise and fall without understanding the family dynamics that drove him throughout his career when aig went public in  hank greenberg became a very wealthy man something that would have been difficult to imagine when he set out on his professional career hank had come home from the second of two tours of duty in the army the first saw him storm omaha beach as a ranger the second put him in korea as a military lawyer in desperate need of a job to support his wife and newborn son jeff he went looking for one up and down william street then the center of the new york city insurance industry legend has it hank eventually talked his way into an entrylevel underwriting position at continental casualty after treating the boss of a dismissive personnel employee to an animated lecture on deportment that was  by  hank had moved to chicago and become the youngest vicepresident ever at continental overseeing the company’s accident and healthinsurance operations then in  a mentor of greenberg’s recommended hank for a job at american international companies by  hank had taken over the company’s domestic operations american home which at that point could barely be considered “thirdrate” according to david schiff the dean of insuranceindustry analysts hank transformed it into a steady source of profits some five years later buoyed by this success he took over as head of the entire company which he incorporated as aig though hank ran a company with hundreds of millions in annual revenue the greenberg household in the early seventies hardly gave the impression of abundant wealth the greenbergs lived in a fairly modest threebedroom apartment on park avenue with jeff evan and younger brother scott sharing a bedroom when they were home from boarding school or college the kids were “not arrogant for the amount of money they had less arrogant than most” says mark abouzeid the son of an aig executive who grew up around the greenbergs in fact hank was determined not to flaunt his good fortune friends were struck by how proud the family was that its modest country home in brewster new york looked even smaller from the roadside visitors to the greenberg residence at the time recall hank as an almost compulsively disciplined and healthconscious man the family routinely ate tofu long before it was fashionable hank rode his exercise bike every morning while watching the today show even thanksgivings were hardly feasts “i was always on a diet but everybody would watch what everybody ate” says nikki finke a hollywood columnist who was jeff’s first wife and who first met the family when evan and jeff were teenagers “it wasn’t like ‘loosen your belt’ for hank and wife corinne it was more to see how little could you eat”      next share this
