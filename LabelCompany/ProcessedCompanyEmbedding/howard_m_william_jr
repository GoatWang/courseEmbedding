former great lakes bulk carrier howard m hanna jr the th anniversary of its launching comes on april  and on june  it will be  years since the vessel arrived at the scrapyard considering the adventures it is amazing that this ship survived  years howard m hanna jr was a product of the cleveland shipbuilding company of cleveland ohio the  ft long by  ft wide freighter was ordered by the richardson transportation company and the  gross ton steamer was soon hauling iron ore coal and grain it had a carrying capacity of  tons deadweight or  bushels of grain ninetyfive years ago this fall the worst storm in great lakes history packed hurricane force winds mountainous waves rain and then blinding snow as a massive low pressure area pummeled the great lakes region from november  to november   in its wake there were about a dozen ships on the bottom with no survivors while others were beatup and aground the coalladen howard m hanna jr enroute from lorain ohio to fort william ontario passed port huron michigan and entered lake huron in the early hours of november  those on board had no idea of what was ahead while even bigger ships were overwhelmed and disappeared beneath the waves the howard m hanna jr was caught in the trough rolled menacingly and came ashore near port austin michigan the vessel sustained smashed windows and other topside damage the hull cracked at the th hatch the ship was flooded aft and the stack toppled fortunately all  sailors on board survived the terrifying ordeal and were saved winter was coming and efforts to refloat the battered hull did not succeed until the following year during the cold weather season most of the cargo of coal disappeared a pail at a time to heat local homes in  howard m hanna jr was taken to collingwood and then on to midland for reconstruction it did not resume service until  when the ship joined the great lakes transit company as glenshee another grounding in the st mary�s river on october   was not as serious but the ship needed to be lightered before floating free on october  the vessel joined canada steamship lines in  and was renamed marquette on october  it carried some ore between marquette michigan and sault ste marie ontario before tying up for the winter at huron ohio when the vessel sailed the following spring csl had renamed it goderich and it continued to work in the iron ore trade sixtyfive years ago on june   goderich was in a collision with the american freighter frank armstrong in the st mary�s river the latter was one of sixteen maritime class ore carriers authorized by the united states maritime commission in world war two and was on its maiden voyage both ships received significant damage another collision on july   involved the ww holloway in lake superior and also required a stop for repairs at the end of the  season goderich was tied up at quebec city quebec pending a sale for scrapping in europe the algoma central and hudson bay railway company stepped up with an offer that was accepted and the ship resumed trading on their account as agawa  years ago in april  agawa operated through the  season and laid up at goderich with a load of grain the local storage elevators were inadequate for seasonal demands and agawa was sold to the goderich elevator company in  for use as a storage barge renamed lionel parsons the ship worked another  years in this capacity until at the age of  it was no longer needed the tug wj ivan purvis powered the last trip up the lakes through the soo lock and on to thunder bay ontario arriving june   there the survivor of the great storm several collisions groundings and a near sale for overseas scrapping was soon dismantled figure  howard m hanna jr at midland vern sweeting collection figure  goderich sailing for
