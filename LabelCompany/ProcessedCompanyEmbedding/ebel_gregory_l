energy partners second quarter earnings call all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise after the speakers remarks there will be a questionandanswer session thank you julie dill chief communications officer you may begin your conference julie a dill  chief communications officer thank you luke and good morning everyone appreciate you joining us today for our review of spectra energys and spectra energy partners  second quarter results with me today are greg ebel president ceo of both spectra energy and spectra energy partners and pat reddy chief financial officer

our safe harbor statement is contained within our presentation materials and available on our website this disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks so i would ask that you refer to it as you review our materials also contained in our presentation materials are nongaap measures that we reconcile to the most directly comparable gaap measures and those reconciliations are also available on our websites with that let me turn things over to pat john patrick reddy  chief financial officer  vice president okay good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today as youve seen in our news releases spectra energy and spectra energy partners delivered solid ongoing earnings and cash for the quarter these results reflect the strength of our diverse portfolio and are in line with our expectations before i get into the details of the quarterly results i want to discuss some special items we recorded in the quarter that lowered reported ebitda by  million the first two items related to the texas eastern pipeline incident that occurred in april in pennsylvania were working closely with phmsa as we conduct a thorough assessment of the incident consistent with the amended corrective action order we received on july  spectra energys other segment included a special item of  million for our selfinsured portion of cost associated with this event us transmission also recorded a special item of  million for inspection and repair cost of our pipeline system in pennsylvania in total we expect to incur special item cost in the range of  million to  million related to these activities importantly we expect that by november  well be in a position to fully meet our customer obligations for the winter season the next item is a  million charge attributable to the effects of recent flooding in british columbia which affected our grizzly valley operations in western canada the full impact of the floods is still being assessed so well update you when we have a clear estimate we expect insurance recovery for the majority of costs associated with this event next is part of the ongoing cost management efforts in our western canadian business segment and the dcp we took charges of  million and  million respectively related to employee and overhead reductions lastly dcp recorded a loss on the sale of an asset during the quarter and our share was  million setting aside these special items our ongoing ebitda was in line with our expectations thanks to the strong fundamentals that support our base business we continue to focus on what we can control allowing us to deliver on the operational financial and project commitments we made to our investors at the beginning of the year lets take a look at our ongoing ebitda results by segment as compared to last year for the quarter ongoing ebitda spectra energy was  million compared with  million in the prioryear quarter spectra energy partners standalone ongoing ebitda was  million compared with  million in the same quarter last year turning to the drivers of spectra energys results by segment lets start with spectra energy partners which is composed of our us transmission and liquids businesses shown in the upper left hand corner of slide  us transmission delivered ongoing ebitda of  million compared with  million in the prioryear quarter quarterly results reflect increased earnings from expansion projects placed into service during the second half of  as well as afudc from our sabal trail aim and nexus projects additionally last year we benefited from a positive property tax adjustment of about  million taking these factors into consideration us transmissions results increased  million over the prioryear quarter our liquids business reported second quarter ebitda of  million compared with  million in  this decrease is due almost entirely to the absence of equity earnings from our interest in the sand hills and southern hills ngl pipelines which spectra energy partners owned until october of last year and while its not particularly material to our quarterly results ill note that we saw slightly higher volumes during the second quarter on our platte pipeline compared with volumes in the first quarter in summary sep continued to demonstrate strong ongoing earnings and cash generation from its significant expansion program sep paid general partner and limited partner distributions to spectra energy for the quarter of  million and  million respectively yeartodate sep has paid gp and lp distributions of  million and  million respectively lets turn now to our canadian business segments which are shown on the right side of the slide for the quarter the canadian dollar was about  lower than in the previous years quarter the lower canadian dollar resulted in negative fx impacts on ebitda of just  million at our canadian businesses the change in net income related to fx was not material despite the lower fx distribution reported second quarter ebitda of  million compared with  million last year the increase was mainly due to incremental earnings from the  dawnparkway expansion project and higher storage margins as well as colder weather western canada recorded ongoing ebitda for the quarter of  million compared with  million last year in line with our expectations results for the quarter reflect lower gathering and processing revenues lower earnings at empress and a lower canadian dollar largely offset by reduced plant turnaround costs this year as previously noted western canada began implementing costsaving measures to prepare for a challenged commodity environment especially as it relates to its gathering and processing business the recent improvements in natural gas prices in western canada is a positive signal for regional producers however we will continue to monitor the macro environment and proactively adjust our business plans to manage accordingly moving to field services our  share of dcps ongoing earnings was a negative  million in the quarter  million better than in the prior year this considerably improved results for the quarter reflect higher earnings attributable to favorable contract realignment efforts continued cost savings initiatives and incremental earnings from expansions these increases were partially offset by lower commodity prices and lower margin volume declines ongoing net expenses in other were  million compared to a  million in  the increase quarteroverquarter reflects higher employee benefit costs driven by an improvement in our stock price as well as an increase in business development expenses so allinall spectra energys ongoing ebitda for the quarter was in line with our expectation and our achievement during the quarter affirms our attractive footprint strong business model and stable cash flows importantly we continued to demonstrate robust cash generation for our investors so lets take a look at our dcf schedules beginning with sep sep standalone ongoing distributable cash flow for the quarter was  million compared with  million last year the lower dcf is primarily attributable to the absence of sand hills and southern hills contributions in  compared with  additionally with seps robust expansion program underway youll also note that afudc was higher this quarter compared with last year and the business incurred lower interest expense due to higher capitalization youll also notice quartertoquarter distributions from equity investments are lower this is strictly a timing issue associated with distributions from gulfstream and sesh we expect fullyear distributions from equity investments to be completely in line with our  guidance for the full year we anticipate seps coverage to be x consistent with our  forecast and earlier this morning sep announced its th consecutive quarterly distribution with an increase of  per unit raising the total quarterly distribution to more than  per lp unit lets turn now to spectra energys distributable cash flow at spectra energy ongoing distributable cash flow was  million for the quarter compared with  million last year the lower dcf is attributable to the same sep drivers i mentioned previously as well as lower maintenance capex due to reduced plant turnaround activities in western canada we expect  full year maintenance capex to be in line with the guidance we provided earlier this year for the full year we expect coverage to be x consistent with the forecast we provided at the beginning of the year while we still have five months to go were feeling very good about how the businesses continue to perform we expect to deliver on the commitments we made for the remainder of the year thanks to our balanced portfolio of businesses and our ability to benefit from our different segments with diverse underlying business drivers one way weve been able to differentiate ourselves this year has been with the flexibility and competitive advantages offered by our structure our investmentgrade balance sheets remain solid and we have total available liquidity across the entire spectra energy enterprise of  billion as of june  we have multiple equity currencies available to us and have used them to ensure the greatest value is delivered to all of our investors let me remind you of the wide range of financing tools we have successfully used in recent months to finance our growth we raised  million in the first quarter through the newly launched spectra energy atm spectra energy equity provides attractive optionality to fund incremental growth sep has raised approximately  million this year through its atm and other lp and gp issuances and late last year westcoast raised cad  million in a preferred share issuance given our excellent liquidity and financial flexibility we have also been able to access the debt markets in an optimal manner for example given the capital markets environment those unfolding last year and was anticipated for  we were able to get a jump on our  debt maturities by successfully prefunding gulfstream and westcoast debt at attractive terms in the second half of  and in the second quarter of this year we were able to opportunistically enter the market with the union gas cad  million new debt issuance with the weighted average interest rate of a little over  for year and year terms and importantly the rating agencies reaffirmed our lowrisk business profile and financing strategy during the quarter fitch affirms spectra energy capital spectra energy partners and texas eastern ratings and raised spectra energy capitals business outlook to triple bbb stable a notable achievement in the current environment dbrs and moodys also reaffirmed the investment grade ratings of westcoast and texas eastern respectively during the quarter we are disciplined and balanced in our financial management and will continue using our competitive cost to capital across our various financing entities investors can have confidence in the capacity of both spectra energy and sep to finance the incremental growth capex weve added to our backlog as youve heard and as we demonstrated we have the financial strength and flexibility to sustain our growth supported by investment grade balance sheets excellent liquidity and multiple attractive currencies so with that let me turn things over to greg who will speak to the impressive slate of projects we have in execution and in development gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer well thanks very much pat and good morning everybody youve heard me say that fundamentals matter and spectra energy and seps fundamentals continue to be extremely strong both companies are an investment for all cycles weve got an outstanding natural gas focus footprint that goes where the lights are to highdemand highgrowth markets our pipelines and projects are feebased with minimal volume risk we serve strong creditworthy customers and as youve just heard we have the investment grade balance sheets and liquidity to support our growth because those fundamentals are working today we are in an even stronger position than we were last quarter or at the beginning of the year let me walk through a few of the actions that have made us stronger and position us well going forward pat has spoken to some of these but i think theyre worth repeating we are one of the few companies that continue to meaningfully add to an already strong project backlog while delivering projects into services plant during the quarter we added  billion in new demand pull projects bringing our total backlog to  billion extending our growth backlog and horizon this impressive track record is possible thanks to a robust project execution model that allows us to hit the mark and meet investor and customer expectations we achieved another solid quarter of strong earnings and cash generation our performance yeartodate is in line with the expectations we had at the beginning of the year underscoring the strength of our portfolio in our market conditions and as pat just mentioned we have further enhanced our competitive position as a result of the successful capital markets activities weve executed so far this year next we reduced our commodity exposure with the sale of the empress ngl business to plains all american we expect the sale to close in the next few days and generate proceeds of approximately  million lastly dcp is making great progress towards its goal to meet or exceed  ngl cash breakeven target based on the addition of feebased assets and the contract realignment efforts todate dcp llcs standalone margin is now about  feebased compared to  at the beginning of  when combined dpm dcps consolidated  margin is expected to now be  feebased all dcps strategic initiatives allow the business to be self sufficient and resilient in a lower for longer environment so weve realized another strong quarter our expansion plans are moving forward nicely so let me update you on the progress were making on our secured projects and execution youve seen this slide before and weve heard from many investors that it highlights the strength and quality of our expensive backlog as i mentioned since our last call weve added  billion in demand pull projects to our backlog and ill speak to those shortly with the addition of these projects  of spectra energys execution portfolio is now supported by demand pull customers up from  at the start of the year but first let me start with the  inservice projects the ozark conversion went into service on time and began flowing product in july all of our other projects including aim are on track for their expected  inservice dates youll note that weve shifted high time to be inservice during the first half of  due to the neb review and i am pleased however to report that the jackfish lake project in western canada is now on an accelerated path to inservice with recent neb approval and construction starting in august we now expect jackfish to be fully inservice in early  ahead of our original expectations and providing a nice offset to the high pine timing our other projects shown on the slide have inservice dates beyond  and are advancing well in achieving important milestones rather than going through all of these individually ill provide a few highlights of our progress since our last call reconstruction work is currently underway on sabal trail the project is scheduled to begin full construction in late summer to meet an early summer  inservice date in july we received the draft environmental impact statement or deis on nexus and teal a significant milestone that keeps these projects on track to be inservice in the fourth quarter of  we received the ferc notice of schedule in july for access south adair southwest and the lebanon extension and we expect the environmental assessment soon this progress keeps us on track for service to commence in the second half of  and penneast received its deis in july as well and is expected to reach its inservice target these are great strides forward and as youve heard me say before regulatory approval and permitting particularly at the state level is the single biggest challenge our industry faces but i have great confidence in our project to execution model and in the people who are working hard to deliver on our growth promises to customers and investors lets now take a look at the  billion in new high quality projects we added to our execution backlog since our last call youll note that these three projects have a similar profile to the others already in execution theyre demandpull projects supported by strong creditworthy customers first union gas added the  million panhandle reinforcement project a regulated cost of service pipeline expansion to serve incremental industrial market growth in southwestern ontario we submitted the oeb application in june with approval expected early next year and inservice by the end of  next we filed the ferc application for the  million bayway lateral in july with an anticipated inservice date in the first half of  this lateral is supported by year contracts with investment grade refinery and cogeneration customers in new jersey and the most significant addition to our backlog is the  billion intrastate valley crossing project so lets take a look at that now in june spectra energy was named the successful bidder in the  bcf nueces to brownsville rfp process conducted by cfe cfe is the mexicos stateowned power utility and a strong investment grade customer the valley crossing project is expected to begin service during the fourth quarter of  and is underpinned by a year feebased us dollar denominated contract this project is significant on its own merits and was meaningfully add to earnings and cash flow but it also positioned us well to pursue other incremental upstream regional business as mexicos energy reforms progress we expect the market will evolve and lead to further opportunities for pipeline expansions as commercial industrial and power generation loads mature cfe is the customer for both the valley crossing and the south texas expansion project or step as such we are more closely aligning the inservice dates for the two projects so when allinall not only have we added significantly to our backlog this quarter weve also notably advanced our projects in execution again this project is a strong indication of a record and reputation for delivering results in addition to the slate of projects in execution we continue to pursue a portfolio of development opportunities which will lead to continued growth beyond  and were working diligently on those the most significant project advancing towards execution this year is the  billion access northeast project weve recently achieved the number of noteworthy milestones on these innovative projects so lets take a look access northeast is uniquely designed both physically and contractually to serve the needs of new england power generators this project is focused on improving reliability and saving consumers an average of  billion a year in energy costs were working with our partners eversource and national grid to advance state approvals for the customer agreements and we are well positioned to participate in the various state processes underway in maine the puc recently voted to endorse a contract with access northeast we view this as a positive development because the state commission concluded following a lengthy independent review that customers would benefit from the project the commission also approved the business model of the electric utilities entering into pipeline capacity contracts the massachusetts department of public utilities commenced hearings yesterday to review the pipeline capacity contracts submitted by affiliates of eversource and national grid and is expected to deliver a decision later this year and over the weekend we cleared another hurdle when the massachusetts legislature passed an energy bill that does not prohibit electric distribution companies from holding gas pipeline capacity contracts connecticuts department of energy and environmental protection issued an rfp for natural gas capacity in the early summer the department received multiple bids in latejune including a bid from access northeast and is now evaluating the submissions with the decision expected in late august in rhode island a longterm pipeline capacity contract with access northeast was submitted to the puc in june and a decision is expected by the end of october so with continued progress on the state regulatory front we anticipate moving the project into execution later this year access northeast is a complex project particularly in its regulatory permitting and public outreach components so the strong partnerships spectra energy has formed with eversource and national grid is invaluable when it comes to understanding and executing on the local ground game and these types of partnerships are important on our other projects as well projects like sabal trail nexus and penneast we believe these types of partnerships provide our investors and customers with greater project execution assurance ownership optionality for us and of course improves our competitive position to realize these projects we are now more than halfway through the year and were clearly demonstrating how our stable disciplined and reliable approach allows us to deliver on our dividend and distribution growth commitments to investors we believe this differentiates spectra energy and sep from many other pipeline companies today so let me summarize what i hope you heard today overall our project execution efforts are proceeding on track second we continue to add projects with attractive returns to our backlog increasing not only the size of the backlog but also the growth horizon third were delivering solid ongoing results that are in line with the expectations we laid out for investors at the beginning of the year and that further underscores the strength and resilience of our portfolio and fourth spectra energy and sep have excellent liquidity in investment grade balance sheet and access to multiple advantageous financing options to efficiently fund our growth as weve demonstrated time time again we make realistic promises and have a record of doing what we say well do in all market conditions both spectra energy and sep are mustown investments and they are exceptionally wellpositioned to continue providing investors with steady growth and attractive returns regardless of economic or commodity cycles so with that let me turn things back to julie so that we can take your questions julie a dill  chief communications officer thanks greg so luke if you would give some instructions in terms of how to queue up for their questions id appreciate it questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of darren horowitz from raymond james your line is open darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc good morning guys greg i know this is a tricky one on access northeast and certainly very tough to handicap but when you think about the four states puc approvals that were required to proceed which state hurdle do you think is going to be the most challenging to clear and if the timeframe does end up getting pushback for situations outside of your control do you have an idea as to how long that process might take to be remedied and what do you think it might mean in terms of deploying capital and actually starting construction gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer well i think clearly given the progress on some of the other states but then just where its located the mass approval – the massachusetts approval are probably the most critical ones that being said its also where i think our partners probably have the best ground game theyre good in the entire region but i feel pretty confident in their ability to achieve that as you know we have not put this project in execution yet but that being said i think at this point in time we still feel confident that well be able to deliver the service as expected the other thing id say darren its really not a financing issue because most of our capital work is done in the last call it seven months to  months of any project cycle so there is no nearterm financing issues related to it its really much more of a get the ground game done and then go out and execute so i guess if you thought there was going to be a delay i couldnt handicap what that is but i can remember a year or two years ago there were multiple projects and now theres just one i dont think theres any doubt that without natural gas infrastructure theyre going to have a hard time keeping light to new england and if you have continued cold weather and i remember two years ago i mentioned  billion in savings but two years ago it was more like  billion in customer savings so i think logic will prevail and as usual the consumer should be the benefactor here and nothing like the consumer actually has power with politicians and regulators darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc how big of a challenge greg do you think its going to be to get the ferc eis i mean you guys filed for it in april but just from a process perspective is there anything that you guys can do in order to expedite the process when do you expect to receive that gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer no i mean like i dont know if we actually have a date on eis at this point in time but i would say i dont see ferc as the big challenge here darren we have a very standard – this is not unique from a ferc perspective this project weve got a pretty well trod path in new england on projects you know about it obviously aim that will be done this year and then atlantic bridge next year i dont expect anything unique on that front i think this is much more about the innovative contracting structure here and the local requirements darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc okay and then quickly if i could on valley crossing gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc you addressed the opportunities upstream of the nueces origin im just thinking from your prospective how do you further leverage texas eastern it looks like there could be multiple source points for hydrocarbons and there could be a meaningful from a return perspective opportunity for you guys to add some significant vertical integration there can you just identify that opportunity set for us gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah well i mean let bill speak to this but i guess what id say is if you look at our history we build backbones and we build ribs often and this is a further extension actually of the texas eastern backbone and so if you follow that backbone up i think thats where the opportunity is bill do you want to william t yardley  presidentus transmission  storage yeah darren i mean i think quite clearly were tapping into an enormous market with the valley crossing project getting into – getting to the border of mexico and if you follow that back and you get to the texas eastern system and our vast infrastructure across the gulf we hit all if not most of the major supply areas and eventually mexico will probably do what it can do to get back to those and i think that puts us in a good position darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc okay gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i think the header system there darren is about  bcf i think there is  interconnects so thats what its all about right i mean if you think it ultimately we are – valley crossing were going where the lights – lights may not hopefully be built yet but there is not – well theyre there theyre not all powered by natural gas yet but thats clearly where the mexican government is going and theyre going to have to reach back into greater supply locations and i think thats a real competitive advantage that we offer darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc and then last question greg just quickly on the financing and i fully agree with you from a scale prospective i mean i think there is a tremendous amount of intrinsic opportunity there but from a financing perspective youve got many different tools at your disposal and you could argue that it possibly could be considered to be financed at the se level and then maybe even drop down to sep hypothetically you could assume that se would want to take more sep units certainly from a tax liability management perspective can you just give me your thoughts roughly on how youre thinking about that gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer i think you just did i think all those options are on the table darren so obviously we want to achieve the lowest cost of capital thats always what we do if theres – if there is a delta between the cost of capital in se and sep we may use that i think its fair to say ultimately its not surprising that youd see this asset regardless of where its initially financed in the sep but again thats going to depend on the expectations of investors both at se and sep and frankly whoever values it most i guess that would make sense for us to finance it there and as you pointed out the tax situation is also a bit unique than it was a year ago darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc thank you gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ted durbin from goldman sachs your line is open theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co good morning gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning ted theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co maybe just starting with nexus and maybe the competitive dynamics into dawn transcanada is now on record as potentially offering a discounted tariff from empress to dawn and then you got obviously the competitive pipeline out of the marcellus its going to bring a lot of gas in there is there a potential that – that we might flood that market maybe potentially rationalize some of the capacity thats getting built out of the marcellus and the dawn gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer well i dont think well flood that market i mean its a massive market i remember some of that gas could flow right through the dawn hub and up the dawnparkway system as you know were building a chunk there and even further east theres nothing new about transcanadas offer that i guess weve seen that multiple years i think theyll be interesting whether they get up any take upon that and as you know there is always some gas that thats going to come from western canada so i dont see that as a big issue ted i guess i would just remind folks of the interconnect right so weve got to think of being a half bill maybe its even gone up a little bit along our pipeline so a bunch of the gas will get dropped off along the way and i think ive said before theoretically if all the interconnects got used thered be no gas from nexus showing up at the dawn i dont expect that to be the case so i feel good that weve sized our pipe correctly weve got the dropoffs along the way that are going to be utilized whether transcanada or not as successful on that front i dont think thats a heat issue from our perspective we continue to be full steam ahead on that i dont know maybe some others have some larger pipes that theyd rationalized but from our perspective i think weve sized this right theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co okay great and then coming back to valley crossing and maybe i missed this but are the returns on this  billion to be in line with what you would normally look for or have you adjusted this a bit given the concentrated counterparty that youre working with and then would you consider actually investing in country thats when your competitors again that have decided to actually go in into mexico and invest there would you rather to stay north of the border gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer so on the first question absolutely this is right in line with our x to x ebitda build i think – and one would maybe expect that so good returns there obviously there was other competition but i think what we offered what we delivered and maybe obviously our cost of capital advantage kept some competitors away from this process at this point in time so thats good on the aside id expect no different returns from this project in fact id say probably is a little better returns than what we see in some of the northeast projects on this project and obviously intrastate law not easier has some less onerous requirements to get built so thats positive as well ted with respect to incountry absolutely wed be interested in the – thats all a discussion of risk what we have seen todate is other investors or other pipeline companies willing to take much higher risks for much lower returns and with  billion in backlog here that didnt seem to be a great idea at this point in time for us so well continue to look at that but obviously we want to balance the risk profile with the returns and typically higher risks to get you higher returns not the other way around theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co that make sense ill leave it with that thank you gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks ted operator your next question comes from the line of brian gamble from simmons  company your line is open brian gamble  simmons  company international good morning guys gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning brian brian gamble  simmons  company international first one for you on valley crossing one more if i may the – i guess look through over the longer term into mexicos plan electric generation needs clearly this is a big project for them and for sep specifically can you talk about i guess the longer term discussions with cfe does this project come i guess halfway to meeting what theyre expecting from a longer term electrification plan or are there other projects like this essentially that could come to fruition over time that you guys may have a legup on already now that this one is in the bush gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah absolutely i think this probably gets them to at least that   timeframe brian but there is no doubt that they will be looking for more opportunities as those gas markets both on the power side but i didnt say industrial and consumer uses as well require more and more gas and thats why i never take it for granted obviously we like our competitive position with this pipe but i think the upstream opportunities along texas eastern back into the supply areas and particularly in suppliers who are going to be looking for outlets so as you know folks in the midcon in the permian and in the eagle ford and such and even i guess she goes as far as the haynesville if you wanted to less desire for that gas in the northeast given all the product up there and the mexico market is perfect so i dont see another major project in say  but if you start to get it to  this pipeline is going to be utilized fully on day one theyll be looking for additional growth opportunities and we think our pathway is going to be extremely competitive so i – its always good to have the backbone brian building the ribs of the backbone is key thats the basis of our entire strategic positioning brian gamble  simmons  company international greg i mean maybe focusing on backlog or maybe sticking in the us from a kind of southeast power pool standpoint weve seen a pretty big shift yearoveryear and it seems to continue to favor natural gas generation i mean throughout the southeastern market youve got sabal trail down there that starts to move gas around a little bit i guess what other additional opportunities or additional avenues are you guys looking at that maybe i guess in response to the dramatic change in the power generation mix that weve seen over the last  months to  months gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer sure bill do you want to take a shot at that william t yardley  presidentus transmission  storage yeah i think in a number of areas were extremely strong i think the southeast is one that love to get a penetration into and so were work in that area hard you may remember few years back we had the renaissance project that we did a fairly high subscription rate we got close but didnt quite get there and we would be willing to try that again because youre right there is a ton of coal conversion and new gas thats going to be going on the southeast and we think we will be a player there but probably need a good fairly large critical mass to get it gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah so i think what bill is saying between sabal and some of the activities that are going on there youre probably meeting that market but as you start again get into that  timeframe all of those power producers are going to be moving more and more gas i think i may even stand corrected by i think very shortly if not now southern in fpl nextera will be the largest buyers of natural gas just about anywhere definitely in north america thats going to continue to need infrastructure and equally so its not so much and i think you point this out its not so much about necessary demand growth with rather anemic economic growth you might be focused on that but its really about fuel switching and diversity of supply as weve seen with sabal sure there is one pipe in through gulfstream some people talked about maybe expanding gulfstream but people want multiple sources of infrastructure and supply and i think thats going to create opportunities too and one thing its a utility and you are seeing those challenges in the northeast you cant run out of gas in the winter thats just a requirement to have it so i think the opportunities are there and but as bill said were not number one in the southeast yet i think were making good progress there and obviously sabal helps us but i see that as an opportunity for us to use not only our cost of capital our competitive position our execution of successes to hone in some of those markets and thats what were looking to do brian gamble  simmons  company international just one quick followup if you think if you repropose renaissance as it was originally proposed do you think you could get what you needed now to get it through gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer dont know it doesnt appear to be a go at this point in time there is some changes around people different ownership structures all that kind of stuff but i can assure you it has not been scratched from our drawing board but we obviously dont have that in the backlog at this point in time it will be needed ultimately brian gamble  simmons  company international appreciate it guys have a good one gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks brian operator your next question comes from the line of kristina kazarian from deutsche bank your line is open kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc good morning guys gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer hi kristina kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc two questions followup kind of one of the questions earlier you guys obviously at the sep level used the atm for the expense leader in the quarter can you just give me some color on how much capacity you guys are thinking you have left there and do you think its having any material impact on that valuation as well gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer john john patrick reddy  chief financial officer  vice president well kristina weve issued about  million roughly under the sep atm in the year and periodically as you need to we can refresh that amount i would say that it – that our rollout back in february we mentioned that we intended to finance projects at sep about  with debt and equity consistent with maintaining our credit rating and the returns on the cost to capital that we used on our projects and so we kept the sep atm turned on during the year its off currently because of the earnings blackout but wed expect that that would come back on and we could use it opportunistically to top up between now and the end of the year with respect to the potential for overhang i dont know i think most of the mlps out there are using these to raise equity of course we have smaller float sense that parent owns about  of the shares outstanding so thats obviously a factor but its very cheap cost of capital for us in terms of the equity issuance cost its less than  as opposed to doing an overnight or a bought deal and it allows us to if you will dribble out the equity as we needed and not frontload and get out ahead of ourselves so – but its great that weve got the ability to toggle you saw us do that in april with  million purchase of sep units by se that was partly driven by tax considerations with bonus depreciation so i think were just kind of keep our options open on that kristina kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc perfect and then i know weve talked a lot about access northeast but when i think about which of the milestones are needed to actually move it into the execution phase which are those and then can you just give me a quick reminder as well i think were still watching the algonquin tariff case at ferc whats the timing here and what does that mean for the project either way william t yardley  presidentus transmission  storage yeah kristina its bill so id say milestones kind of in order would be lets get through the massachusetts sjc that decision probably coming in the next – within the next month or so if thats a go then i think weve got a lot of momentum connecticuts rfp will be decided in the fall and rhode island will issue their decision on the contract that national grid submitted probably by the end of october all that points to a late fourth quarter i would say movement into execution of the project so thats – i would say thats – those are probably the biggest milestones in terms of ferc i think i would expect a decision sooner rather than later on that there has been a lot of – a fair amount of publicity around it but in reality i mean this is something that is tariff waiver that frankly the ldcs enjoy now in a different form but same concept in order to facilitate retail unbundling so i would expect a positive decision there and while it wouldnt derail the project for sure because there are alternatives its just administratively more challenging kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc perfect thanks bill i always appreciate your expertise operator your next question comes from the line of danilo juvane from bmo capital markets your line is open danilo juvane  bmo capital markets united states thank you most of my questions have been hit just had one quick followup with respect to the equity distribution at sep should we expect that the number that you reported this quarter to be the run rate going forward i know that last quarter there was something funky with the timing of that distribution as well i was just trying to figure out how that looks on a go forward basis here gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer you are talking about the distributions from equity investment danilo there was something unusual in the first quarter relating to sesh and gulfstream and it had to do with the change from quarterly distributions to monthly and so our distributions this quarter are down about  million as a result of that change but by the end of the year well be exactly on track to our – to the number we had in our rollout in february so its really just a timing between the quarters danilo juvane  bmo capital markets united states okay so the  million is that sort of an appropriate run rate to think about for the balance of the year there gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer in turn yes thats right danilo juvane  bmo capital markets united states okay all right thank you thats it from me thanks operator your next question comes from the line of jean ann salisbury from bernstein your line is open jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc hi im trying to understand how much exposure to rising ngl prices on se has is it correct to say that because of the debt covenant at dcp the exposure from dcp is minimal through at least  from a distributable cash standpoint gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer yes absolutely yeah we dont – at se proper wed have no exposure to ngls either up or down thats all at dcp and obviously its got its own rating as you know and the debt covenants at se dont affect that and as you would have seen in our threeyear plan we have not expected anything material from dcp on a goforward basis jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc okay great thanks gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc and then just another one on rover and nexus they have very similar ferc review timelines i was wondering whether in your ongoing discussions with ferc youve heard any indication either way – of if theyre thinking of the combined impact of the projects or treating them as completely individually gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer i think theyve looked at those completely individually i think there was a phone call that involved ferc commissioner tony clark by one of the houses this week and i think he spoke to that directly actually so remember very different markets i know a lot people look at dawn but remember our project is going arguably just a little bit west and then straight north the competitive projects are out there going to defiance and serving quite different markets jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc okay great thats all from me thanks gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of michael blum from wells fargo your line is open michael blum  wells fargo securities llc hey good morning just  gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer hi michael michael blum  wells fargo securities llc i think the only thing that was uncovered that i wanted to talk about was just – so obviously the dc court of appeals remanded the income tax allowance issue back to the ferc regarding ownership of pipelines inside of the partnership structure i was just wondering if you guys can comment just generally your thoughts on how this plays out and then the affect that ferc did change its policy how that would impact the sep thanks gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah as you know i think the ferc folks have a lot of opportunity here to look at this and i personally dont think theyll make a change in how to deal with this but i think theres a couple of unique elements to spectra and the first one is  or  of our mlp is owned by the ccorp and as such we already pay the taxes so the impact would be rather a minimal to us and then b we dont have any cases like that sitting before the ferc today so i wouldnt expect were not looking for changes in rates or structures and the vast majority of all our new contracts obviously not the vast majority virtually all of them are negotiated rates so id say at least for a company like spectra energy if they went an unexpected route i dont think it would have a material – it would not have a material impact on spectra energy michael blum  wells fargo securities llc great thank you gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks michael john patrick reddy  chief financial officer  vice president and greg i had a clarification based on danilos question i may not have understood the last part about the run rate let me just say as i mentioned wed be on track to get about the  million that we had budgeted for the full year for the first six months were about little under a  million so thats what we got twothirds in the first six months of that and the balance in the second six months so i wouldnt take anyone of the quarters and annualize it operator your next question comes from the line of nick raza from citi your line is open nick s raza  citigroup global markets inc broker thank you most of my questions were answered but i have just a couple of addons folks first off on the aim  could you just give us a status update and just how you guys are still scheduled to make the inservice date in november gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah absolutely were full steam ahead as you know its a challenging environment out there but as you know weve got all of our permits where we expect to be in service on november  and i would say nothing that weve seen has really surprised us weve worked up there for a long period of time and expect to see us in service the st of november nick s raza  citigroup global markets inc broker okay awesome and then i guess the question that i had was – the access to northeast project is there an opportunity there to sort of build out the vermont i think youll recall there was some mention of serving that market as well if you guys could talk about that gregory l ebel  chairman president  chief executive officer were ways – were ways away from vermont we – the algonquin system that traverses new england which is our pipelines kind of comes up through southern new england and through connecticut rhode island and up to boston it would be a long pull to get a pipe to vermont from our system for probably what is a small amount of load and so i would not look for us to do that anytime soon nick s raza  citigroup global markets inc broker okay fair enough thats all i had guys thank you operator there are no further questions at this time i turn the call back over to the presenters julie a dill  chief communications officer great well luke thanks very much and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today were going to be seeing many of you i know next week at a conference and then the following week at the city mlp conference as well so well look forward to seeing you then in the meantime if you have any additional questions please dont feel – dont hesitate to give
