diversified metal products inc plaintiff v tbow company trust internal revenue service and steve morgan defendants case no cv eblw united states district court for the district of idaho  us dist  us tax cas cch p  aftrd ria  july   decided july   filed disposition  united states motion for summary judgment docket no  filed april   granted the funds currently held in the courts registry paid to the united states pursuant to a proposed judgment consistent with this decision the trial currently set for july   vacated counsel for internal revenue service defendant betty h richardson us attorneys office boise id paul w sharratt us dept of justice tax division washington dc judges b lynn winmill united states district judge opinion by b lynn winmill opinion memorandum decision and order i introduction this matter comes before the court on defendant united states motion for summary judgment the motion was filed on april   and no opposition to the motion has been filed therefore the court has considered the brief submitted by the united states as well as the applicable case law and facts of this case and issues the following decision and order ii facts diversified metal products inc diversified is a steel and metal fabricator doing business in idaho falls idaho steven morgan was employed by diversified during  where he performed welding and other services tbow company trust tbow was an unincorporated trust organization created july   and terminated in  with steven morgan as its manager the address listed for tbow was  the same as morgans home address tbow entered into an independent contractor agreement with diversified on may   however the effective date of the agreement was march   pursuant to the agreement morgan performed the same welding and other services at diversified as he had prior to that time however tbow billed diversified for the work morgan performed and diversified paid morgans wages directly to tbow morgan performed all labor or services provided by tbow tbow had a checking account at the bank of commerce from march   to august   the signature card for tbow indicated that marlin hill as trustee and steven and koreen morgan had signature authority on the account deposits to tbows account at the bank of commerce totaled   the checks written on the tbow account indicate a pattern in that checks were made out to cash and then designated to an individual or entity in the memo portion of the check the individuals or entity listed in the memo designations were sk  bunch holding ralph brian koreen morgan and steven morgan n the total of the checks made payable to or listed in the memo designation as for sk   bunch holding koreen morgan and steven morgan for the period between march  through july  was   footnotes n the united states also contends that sk  bunch holding trust a trust created with identical documents as tbow is a nominee of steven morgan the internal revenue service has so determined however that is not at issue before the court and will not be decided here end footnotes the internal revenue service has made assessments of unpaid federal income taxes against steven and koreen morgan jointly and steven morgan individually three separate assessments were made with notice of federal tax liens being filed with the madison county recorder in rexburg idaho on august   on august   the internal revenue service served a notice of levy on steven morgans employer diversified requesting payment of all wages salary or other income owed to steven morgan the morgans have failed to voluntarily pay these federal tax liabilities the only payments have come as a result of the seizure and  sale of the morgans property by the internal revenue service as of april   the outstanding liability including statutory interest from the  and  tax years is   which liabilities continue to accrue interest at the statutory rate this interpleader action was filed by diversified in order for the court to determine competing claims to two checks totaling   the action was originally filed in bonneville county idaho and removed to this court by the united states the checks are from diversified and made payable to tbow and represent monies paid for welding and other labor performed by steven morgan at diversified the united states tbow and steven morgan all claim an interest in the funds although diversified has been previously dismissed on its own motion it requests attorneys fees and costs should the united states be unsuccessful in its claim the united states submits this motion for summary judgment and claims that it has priority to the interpleaded funds over the other claimants because the of the liens that arose in its favor as of the date of the assessments the united states contends that these liens have priority over the claims  of steven morgan as they attach to all of his property and rights to property the united states further argues that its liens have priority over tbow as tbow is merely an alter ego andor nominee of steven morgan finally the united states argues that because it is entitled to the entire funds interpleaded to the court diversified may not recover attorneys fees as such would diminish the united states recovery on its tax liens iii summary judgment standard motions for summary judgment are governed by rule  of the federal rules of civil procedure rule  provides in pertinent part that judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings depositions answers to interrogatories and admissions on file together with the affidavits if any show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law uscs court rules rule c federal rules of civil procedure the supreme court has made it clear that under rule  summary judgment is mandated if the nonmoving party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element which is essential to the nonmoving partys  case and upon which the nonmoving party will bear the burden of proof at trial see celotex corp v catrett  us    l ed d   s ct   if the nonmoving party fails to make such a showing on any essential element there can be no genuine issue of material fact since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving partys case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial id at  n footnotes n see also rule e which provides in part when a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse partys pleadings but the adverse partys response by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial if the adverse party does not so respond summary judgment if appropriate shall be entered against the adverse party uscs court rules rules of civil procedure rule e end footnotes moreover under rule  it is clear that an issue in order to preclude entry of summary judgment must be both material and genuine an issue is material if it affects the outcome of the litigation an issue before it may be considered genuine must be established by sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute    to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties differing versions of the truth at trial hahn v sargent  fd   st cir  quoting first natl bank v cities serv co inc  us    l ed d   s ct   the ninth circuit cases are in accord see eg british motor car distrib v san francisco automotive indus welfare fund  fd  th cir  according to the ninth circuit in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment a party  must make a showing sufficient to establish a genuine issue of fact with respect to any element for which it bears the burden of proof  must show that there is an issue that may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party and  must come forward with more persuasive evidence than would otherwise be necessary when  the factual context makes the nonmoving partys claim implausible id at  citation omitted of course when applying the above standard the court must view all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party anderson v liberty lobby inc  us    l ed d   s ct   hughes v united states  fd   th cir  iv discussion the united states bases its motion for summary judgment on its contention that its claims have priority over those of both morgan and tbow n pursuant to the internal revenue code if a person who is liable to pay any federal tax fails to pay such tax after notice and demand a federal tax lien arises against all property and rights to property belonging to that person irc ß  the date the lien arises is the date of the assessment of the tax and continues in full force and effect until the liability is extinguished or becomes unenforceable irc ß  the lien attaches to all afteracquired property of the taxpayer including rights to payment bank of america natl trust  savings assn v mamakos  fd   th cir  furthermore  in order to be enforceable as against third parties the notice of federal tax lien must be filed a federal tax lien arises automatically upon the failure of a taxpayer to pay an assessed tax after notice and demand irc ß  see also united states v speers  us    l ed d   s ct   footnotes n the internal revenue service and not the united states was originally named as defendant in this action however the united states is correct that the internal revenue service has no capacity to sue or be sued blackmar v guerre  us    l ed   s ct   therefore the united states is properly substituted for the internal revenue service in this action end footnotes exhibits   and  to the declaration of cindy mason indicate that notice of the tax liabilities were served on the morgans the certificates of assessments and payments submitted as attachments to exhibits  and  in the absence of evidence to the contrary are presumptive evidence that assessments  were properly made and that the required notices were properly mailed hughes v united states  fd   th cir  additionally exhibits   and  to the declaration of cindy mason indicate that the three notice of federal tax liens were properly recorded n the court in the absence of any evidence to the contrary finds that the liabilities were properly calculated the morgans and tbow were given proper notice and demand for payment and the liens were properly recorded the liens arose on the dates of assessment may   n the two checks at issue from diversified were issued on august   and august   after the liens had arisen footnotes n the court notes that exhibit  is a lien notice against both steven and koreen morgan and was recorded on august   exhibit  is a lien notice against steven morgan only and was recorded on august   exhibit  is a lien notice against tbow as agent nominee transferee andor alter ego of steven and koreen morgan it was not recorded until november   n the court notes that the  tax liability which totals   and is referenced in exhibits  and  to the declaration of cindy mason has been satisfied and is no longer at issue in the instant case end footnotes the priority of federal tax liens is governed by a first in time first in right theory a competing claim prevails against a federal tax lien only if it becomes choate and perfected before the federal tax lien attaches and becomes effective united states v city of new britain  us    l ed   s ct   to be choate a competing claim must be definite as to the identify of the lienor definite as to the identity of the property to which the lien attaches and definite as to the amount of the lien id no such claim has been alleged and thus the united states argues that to the extent the interpleaded funds are determined to be property or rights to property of steven morgan the federal tax liens have attached and must be paid prior to any claim by steven morgan to such funds priority over tbow the united states argues that the federal tax lien takes priority over and attaches to any funds due tbow for work performed by steven morgan at diversified because tbow is the alter ego andor nominee of morgan and that it is a sham trust devoid of economic reality as stated above the liens properly arose on may   and  thus the tax liens against steven morgan attach to all property and rights to property owned by him on may   and thereafter acquired irc ß  runkel v united states  fd   th cir  the internal revenue service is authorized to levy upon property that belongs to the taxpayer but is possessed by or nominally held by the taxpayers nominee alterego or transferee alkim inc v united states  fd   th cir  see also wolfe v united states  fd   th cir  irc ß  that being said the next question is whether tbow is the alterego of steven morgan as the united states brief points out the issue of whether steven morgan has a property interest is an issue decided by state law see aquilino v united states  us    l ed d   s ct   towe antique ford foundation v internal revenue service  fd   th cir  the idaho supreme court has stated that if  there is such a unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the corporation and the individual no longer exist and  if the acts are treated  as those of the corporation an inequitable result will follow then the corporate entity may be disregarded see chick v tomlinson  pd    idaho  idaho  the tomlinson court examined several factors when it considered whether to disregard an entitys separate identity these factors have been utilized as a nonexclusive list by other courts as well they are  whether the individual is a majority shareholder officer director trustee managing partner or otherwise in a position of authority over the affairs of the entity  whether the individual controls and dominates the business entitys actions and affairs without consulting others  whether the individual controls and sometimes withholds information from other investors  whether the individual uses the business entity to shield himself from personal liability  whether the individual uses the business entity for his own personal and financial gain  whether the individual mingles his own and his familys affairs in the affairs of the business entity and  whether the individual uses the business entity to assume his own debts or the  debts of another or whether the individual uses his own funds to pay the business entitys debts see towe antique ford foundation v irs supra  fd  at  applying montana law the first factor is met as morgan was a manager of tbow the second factor is satisfied since morgan was able to act independently of the trustees the trust creation documents indicate that marlin hill needed to cosign all checks and approve all major purchases however the documents also allowed him to delegate the management of the trust to others steven and koreen morgan were managers of the trust it is also clear that morgan has mingled his own and his familys affairs in those of tbow the united states further cites to the fact that morgan had been assessed for his  federal tax liability prior to the time when tbow was formed additionally morgans  and  tax liabilities had accrued prior to december   which is the date tbows creation documents were filed with the madison county recorder he was also under a labor contract with tbow and morgans employer and duties were unchanged after the independent contractor agreement was executed between  tbow and diversified finally the funds paid to tbow by diversified were placed in tbows checking account and then checks were made out on that account and designated to steven morgan koreen morgan or sk  bunch holding trust which the internal revenue service has determined to be another nominee of steven morgan the towe court considered additional factors in determining whether an alter ego situation existed those factors are whether  no consideration or inadequate consideration was paid by the nominee  the property was placed in the name of the nominee in anticipation of a suit or occurrence of liabilities while the transferor continued to exercise control over the property  a close relationship between transferor and the nominee existed  the conveyance failed to be recorded  possession was retained by the transferor and  the transferor continued to enjoy the benefits of the transferred property see towe antique ford foundation v irs supra  fd at  in the instant case the tax liabilities had already arisen when the trust was formed and the morgans had notice of those liabilities  prior to the execution of the independent contractor agreement these facts indicate that the channeling of wages through tbow was done in anticipation of the tax lien all the while morgan continued to exercise control over the money it is also clear that a close relationship existed between the morgans and tbow steven and koreen morgan were managers of the trust and their home address was an address listed for the trust the trust was in effect steven morgans employer as it contracted to send steven out to work at diversified and billed diversified for stevens wages steven was paid directly by tbow and only indirectly by diversified it is also clear that morgan retained possession and continued to enjoy the benefits of tbows assets the morgans continued to retain possession of the funds in the tbow account by virtue of their managerial status and because tbow paid steven his wages from the trust checking account based on the foregoing the court finds that tbow was in fact the alter ego of steven morgan because of the alter ego status of tbow the funds payable to tbow and deposited within the registry of the court are properly considered to be the property  of steven morgan and thus subject to the federal tax lien n footnotes n an additional ground for granting summary judgment is that the morgans have failed to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element which is essential to their case and upon which they will bear the burden of proof at trial celotex corp v catrett  us    l ed d   s ct   by not responding to the motion for summary judgment the morgans have made no showing that steven morgan or tbow has any claim to the funds which has priority over the united states lien for this reason alone the court could grant summary judgment to the united states however the court finds it preferable to resolve motions for summary judgment on the merits whenever possible end footnotes diversifieds claim for attorneys fees the ninth circuit has held that a partys claim for attorneys fees and costs may not deplete any portion of any interpleaded fund prior to full satisfaction of the federal  tax lien thereon abex corp v skis enterprises inc  fd   th cir  diversified apparently concedes this fact as it only sought attorneys fees in the event that the united states did not prevail on its claim to the funds here the lien far exceeds the   interpleaded and thus the court will not grant diversified its attorneys fees in this matter v conclusion the court finds that the federal tax lien was properly assessed noticed and recorded and that it takes priority over any competing claims the court further finds that tbow was the alter ego ornominee of steven morgan and the funds payable to it are in fact morgans property and subject to the lien finally because an award of attorneys fees to diversified would deplete the interpleaded funds prior to full satisfaction of the lien the court declines to award such fees and costs vi order based on the foregoing and the court being fully advised in the premises it is therefore ordered that the united states motion for summary judgment docket no  filed april   should be and is hereby granted it is further ordered that the funds currently  held in the courts registry shall be paid to the united states pursuant to a proposed judgment consistent with this decision the court directs the united states to prepare and submit for the courts approval such proposed judgment it is further ordered that the trial currently set for july   is hereby vacated dated this th day of july  b lynn winmill united states
