anticipated in the second quarter of  with earlier studies demonstrating effects on steatosis inflammation and fibrosis i believed that the stock would eventually get more attention from wall street as the year progressed taking into account recent deal premiums and scarcity of wholly owned nash assets i stated i wouldnt be surprised for the company to be the subject of ma speculation data presentation data was presented at the rd annual meeting of the european association for the study of the liver easl during the international liver congress ilc in april efficacy of aramchol was demonstrated in mcd nash and taa fibrosis models with the latter showing a direct antifibrotic effect results indicated that aramchol has a dual effect on fibrosis by improving fatty acid oxidation in addition to a direct impact on collagen producing cells which in turn could actually reverse fibrosis other developments a notable election to the board of directors was made when dr carol brosgart was chosen she previously served as vice president of clinical research at gilead sciences gild and was instrumental in the launches of hepatitis b products also noteworthy she was a member of the

cash burn of  million on the conference call it was mentioned that aramchol could be a very unique nash asset one that has been shown to downregulate steatosis and has a direct effect on fibrosis the asset could be used as a standalone treatment or in combination with antiinflammatory treatments chief scientific officer liat hyardeny commented that we could see combination studies in the future in comments on outcomes for the phase  arrest study chief medical officer tali gorfine noted that a  reduction in steatosis would be significant of patients enrolled in the trial  had stage three fibrosis at baseline  with stage  fibrosis and  with stage zero fibrosis this illustrates that the patient population enrolled has rather advanced disease and  had a nas score of five or higher final thoughts earnings are coming on july st so interested readers should stay tuned for further updates from management on study progression and any indications of progress in business development i dont want to read too much into the appointment of dr brosgart to the board of directors but with prior experience at tobira and gilead i wouldnt be surprised to see her connections put to good use for a collaboration or acquisition tobira was acquired for a premium of over   even a  premium for galmed would be pocket change for the majority of interested parties to receive a nash call option in the form of aramchol for readers who bought shares after the first article i would take partial profits in the range of  to  depending on risk tolerance this would allow significant upside exposure as i believe we could continue to see a significant runup into data for those who have done their due diligence and are interested in the story any potential weakness caused by a secondary offering in the near term could offer a potential buy point to establish a pilot position risks to the story include setbacks with the arrest trial as well as the possibility of disappointing data additionally as stated before the companys limited cash position is a concern and nearterm dilution is expected intense competition in the nash space is also a concern as other assets exist that are further along in

aramchol™ noninvasive companion diagnostic program jul    et from galmed pharmaceuticals ltd tel aviv israel july   prnewswire  galmed pharmaceuticals ltd nasdaq glmd galmed a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a oncedaily oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases announced today that it has entered into a research option and license agreement license agreement and a share purchase agreement with one way liver genomics sl owl for the development of a noninvasive bloodbased companion diagnostic tool  under the license agreement galmed and owl will work together during galmeds phase iib arrest study to develop a noninvasive blood test including metabolic markers biomarkers that could potentially predict therapeutic responses to aramcholtm galmeds oncedaily oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or nash  the development of this proprietary noninvasive companion diagnostic for aramcholtm serves a dual purpose commercializing a companion diagnostic for aramcholtm that could replace liver biopsy in testing the ongoing efficacy of treatment which may enhance aramcholtm market penetration improving nash patient selection for aramcholtm including for galmeds potential future phase iii study under the terms of the license agreement owl will develop a proprietary companion diagnostic exclusive for aramcholtm which will be cofunded by galmed up to € over the course of the arrest study and paid based on reaching development milestones  upon commercialization owl may earn  royalties on annual net sales of the companion diagnostic product separately under the terms of the share purchase agreement owl stands to earn two milestone payments during the arrest study  the first payment of € will be paid upon the successful completion of the arrest studys interim results expected during the first half of  the second milestone payment of € will be paid upon the successful completion of the arrest study  through these two milestone payments totaling € galmed shall receive shares of owl based on its most recent valuation  finally owl has granted galmed an option to purchase additional shares up to  of owl building on several years of collaboration between galmed and owl todays announcement further positions the companies as frontrunners in the treatment and diagnosis of nash and other liver diseases in order to diagnose and treat the vast number of nash patients its imperative that galmed takes a comprehensive approach  its critical that the medical and scientific community collaborate to find validated noninvasive diagnostic tools  its clear that todays standard of care for the diagnosis of nash – an invasive liver biopsy – will become obsolete over the coming years and will not serve as a suitable followup tool to determine the success of treatment  galmed is endeavoring to assume a leadership role in both the treatment and diagnosis of nash stated allen baharaff galmeds president and chief executive officer  mr baharaff continued the collaboration with owl one of the worlds leading metabolomics companies is an important milestone in our strategic development plan our team of liver research professionals are proud to be involved in the exciting and innovative clinical development of aramcholtm  owl recognizes the unique synergies that will be created with galmed in the development of aramcholtm  the studies that we will perform during the arrest study will allow us to obtain a more advanced owliver® product our noninvasive test to diagnose nash and identify surrogate markers linked to aramcholtm response in patients suffering from nash  we believe that regulatory agencies will recognize the benefits of noninvasive approaches for the diagnosis of nash commented pablo ortiz md phd owls chief executive officer mr baharaff and dr ortiz concluded todays partnership which is the first step in the identification of biomarkers capable of predicting an individuals response to aramcholtm is critical to the development of personalized strategies that will optimize therapeutic outcomes about galmed pharmaceuticals ltd galmed is a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a novel oncedaily oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases utilizing its proprietary firstinclass family of synthetic fattyacidbileacid conjugates or fabacs  galmed believes that its product candidate aramcholtm has the potential to be a disease modifying treatment for fatty liver disorders including nash which is a chronic disease that galmed believes constitutes a large unmet medical need about one way liver genomics sl owl is a privatelyheld biotech company based in derio spain committed to the research and development of pioneering diagnostic assays for liver conditions and other complex human diseases through metabolomics  it is currently highly focused on global commercialization of owliver® a noninvasive bloodbased diagnostic test of nash and in the identification of potential metabolic markers of the different histopathological changes occurring in the

the authors’ knowledge an animal model for cash has not been described previously it has been established that fatty acid bile acid conjugates fabacs prevent the formation of dietinduced fatty liver the current study was designed to establish an animal model of cash and to use that model to study the effect of fabacs on its occurrencemethods cbl mice were given different doses of oxaliplatin and irinotecan oxaliplatin administered once weekly at a dose of  mgkg for a total dose of  mgkg was tolerated best and was associated most consistently with cash thus that dose was chosen as the induction model for cash subsequently mice were divided into a control group no treatment an oxaliplatin group and a cashprevention group which received oxaliplatin and cfabac at a dose of  mgkg daily the animals were killed after  daysresults  liver fat content was significantly lower p   in the control group  mgg and the prevention group  mgg compared with the oxaliplatin group  mgg this difference was mainly because of the accumulation of liver triglycerides in the oxaliplatin groupconclusions  the current results indicated that cbl mice receiving weekly oxaliplatin can be used as a

acid conjugates fabacs are novel synthetic lipid molecules which were designed for the treatment of cholesterol gallstones the rationale was to combine a cholesterol solubilizing moiety a saturated fatty acid with a bile acid cholic acid as a vehicle to enable secretion into bile and entry into the enterohepatic circulation an amide bond was used to provide stability against intestinal degradation initial in vitro studies showed that fabacs are indeed cholesterol solubilizers able to prevent biliary cholesterol crystallization arachidylamidocholanoic acid aramchol was found to be the most potent fabac in these studies animal studies revealed that aramchol was absorbed after oral administration and could prevent cholesterol crystallization as well as dissolve preformed crystals in rodents fed a lithogenic diet in gallstone susceptible mice aramchol prevented gallstone formation and dissolved gallstones fabacs were found to be metabolically active substances also able to decrease blood cholesterol atherosclerotic plaques and fat accumulation in the liver in several animal species the underlying mechanisms of action are under active investigation and several effects eg on cholesterol and bile salt metabolizing enzymes as well as cholesterol efflux from cells have been discovered these findings are however only the beginning of our understanding of the metabolic

molecules that solubilize cholesterol prevent cholesterol crystal and gallstone formation and dissolve preexisting gallstones in mice they are thus potential agents for gallstone prevention and treatment the available knowledge concerning their biliary systemic or possible toxic effects is however incompleteaim  to obtain information regarding biliary and systemic effects of fabacsmethods  hamsters rats and mice were administered cfabac intragastrically and serum and bile chemistries organ histology animal wellbeing and survival were monitoredresults   fabac feeding  mgkgday caused no adverse effects in any of the animal species studied fabac did not influence biliary cholesterol phospholipid or bilesalt concentrations in mice in hamsters biliary cholesterol concentration decreased slightly but effects on phospholipids and bile salts were inconsistent in some mouse strains fabac supplementation increased transaminases slightly in hamsters and rats transaminases were mainly unaffected or even decreased serum alkaline phosphatase creatinine albumin and glucose were generally unaffected by fabac feeding no gross or histopathological differences between controls and fabacfed animals were noted in any of the organs investigatedconclusions  cfabac given at a pharmacological dose is safe and devoid of any significant toxic effects in three different animal species

study whether fatty acid bile acid conjugates fabacs have a beneficial effect on atherosclerosis progression and blood lipid levels in micemethods  cbl female mice fed a highfat paigen diet were administered an oral dose of fabac or ddho daily quantification of atherosclerotic fattystreak lesions at the aortic sinus was performedresults    the fabactreated mice showed a significant reduction in the atherosclerotic lesion areas as compared to the control group p   a significant elevation in total cholesterol levels was observed in both the fabac and control groups higher fabac levels were measured in the highdensity lipoprotein fraction as compared to the verylowdensity and lowdensity lipoprotein fractionsconclusions our findings demonstrate that fabacs given orally reduce the

octabstractwe have recently synthesized fatty acid bile acid conjugates fabac that were able to reduce and retard cholesterol crystallization in model and human biles when given orally they prevented the formation of cholesterol crystals in the bile of hamsters the aim of the present study was to determine whether the fabac are cholesterol solubilizers whether they can dissolve preexisting crystals whether they can prevent the formation of cholesterol gallstones and to investigate the optimal type of bond between the fatty acid and bile acid the presence of cholesterol crystals was determined by light microscopy and the total crystal mass of precipitated crystals was measured by chemical means inbred cjl mice on a lithogenic diet were used to evaluate cholesterol crystal formation dissolution and gallstone formation in vivo arachidyl amido cholanoic acid aramchol was the fabac used in the present experiments at equimolar amounts the cholesterolsolubilizing capacity of aramchol was higher than that of taurocholate and similar to that of phosphatidylcholine the addition of aramchol dissolved approximately  of preexisting crystals in model bile solutions the same phenomenon was demonstrated in human bile ex vivo with a doseresponse effect all inbred mice developed cholesterol crystals in bile after  d on the lithogenic diet thereafter supplementation of the diet with aramchol progressively reduced the proportion of mice with crystals to  after  d on the lithogenic diet  of inbred mice developed cholesterol gallstones in the gallbladder by day  none of the mice whose diet was supplemented with  mg or  mg of aramchold developed stones or crystals fabac are a new class of molecules that are cholesterol solubilizers and which are able to dissolve

cholesterol gall stones are a frequent disease for which at present surgery is the usual therapy despite the importance of bile acids it has become evident that phospholipids are the main cholesterol solubilisers in bile even phospholipid components such as fatty acids have anticrystallising activityaim to synthesise fatty acid bile acid conjugates fabacs and study their effects on cholesterol crystallisation in bile in vitro and in vivomethods  fabacs were prepared by conjugation of cholic acid at position  with saturated fatty acids of variable chain length using an amide bond cholesterol crystallisation and its kinetics crystal observation time crystal mass were studied in model bile pooled enriched human bile and fresh human bile using fabacs with saturated fatty acids of varying chain length c to c absorption of fabacs into blood and bile was tested in hamsters prevention of biliary cholesterol crystallisation in vivo was tested in hamsters and inbred miceresults  fabacs strongly inhibited cholesterol crystallisation in model as well as native bile the fabacs with longer acyl chains c to c were more effective at a concentration of  mm fabacs almost completely inhibited cholesterol crystallisation in fresh human bile for  days fabacs were absorbed and found in both portal and heart blood of hamsters levels in bile were  times higher than in blood indicating active secretion appreciable levels were found in the systemic circulation  hours after a single administration ingested fabacs completely prevented the formation of cholesterol crystals in the gall bladders of hamsters and mice fed a lithogenic dietconclusions  fabacs are potent inhibitors of cholesterol crystallisation in bile they are absorbed and secreted into bile and prevent the earliest
