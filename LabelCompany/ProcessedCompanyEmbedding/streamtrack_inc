results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and those in our form k for the fiscal year ended august   filed with the securities and exchange commission december   and all subsequent filings overview streamtrack inc streamtrack or the company is a digital media and technology services company the company provides audio and video streaming and advertising services through the radioloyaltytm platform the platform to a global group of over  internet and terrestrial radio stations and other broadcast content providers we also developing robot fruit which is intended to be a powerful marketing tool that combines a mobile app creation platform customer loyalty program and content management system into an instant and measurable marketing engine for businesses the company is also continuing development of streamtrak designed to enable fans artists bands music publishers and record labels to distribute discover create and share contentin addition the company through ampedfantasycom has entered the rapidly growing daily fantasy sports industry the amped fantasy brand will offer diverse contests to attract fans of all kinds the mobile and web offering which is under development will include but not be limited to free and paid daily weekly pickem

others feel closer to the real life game and all with no seasonlong commitment through sportsalertcom the company owns a subscriber based alert system for various sports with over  registered users users can choose whether they want score updates sent to their mobile phone or email customizable by sport and events our streaming business model is focused on the following core principles  we barter with audio content providers namely internet and terrestrial radio stations to obtain control and management of their desktop advertising opportunity ad inventory we also routinely purchase any ad inventory the content providers have not previously transferred to us by barter  in exchange for the ad inventory we pay for all internet and mobile streaming costs associated with the broadcasters content that is streamed through our platform we barter in order to scale our business the end result of the barter is that we aggregate ad inventory from broadcasters that management believes can reach substantial size while maintaining a primarily fixed cost structure for our hardware content delivery labor and other costs respectively  we rebroadcast original audio broadcast content through the platform in a streaming media format in desktop and mobile environments by rebroadcasting we ensure that we do not pay any royalties royalties are the responsibility of our broadcasters this is a substantial advantage for us as many of our competitors pay royalties of up to  of revenues generated from licensed broadcast content  we serve advertisements ads within the platform in audio display and video formats in a desktop environment and display ads in a mobile environment using our radioloyaltytm apps  ads are served by our automated systems based on geography and demographics data among others  the primary technology that makes our platform unique in the industry is that we are able to rebroadcast audio content with geographically targeted ads that replace ads served within an original broadcast targeting a listener in a certain geography by having this capability we can also choose to replace audio ads that do not generate as high of ad revenues with videobased ads that generate much higher ad revenues in effect we make the broadcasters original broadcast capable of delivering ads that are geographically targeted throughout a global broadcast marketplace while also utilizing video ads and our proprietary video instream technology to increase advertising rates  all of our primary technology that supports the platform is automated and capable of operating in a live environment audio content is streamed ads are targeted and served audio ads are replaced as needed and video ads replace audio ads as desired and when possible advertising revenue constitutes the majority of our total revenue representing  of total revenue for the nine months ended may   we anticipate this trend will continue and our revenues will be generated primarily from advertising our advertising revenue for the nine months ended may   was almost entirely derived from advertising delivered on desktop devices we deliver content on mobile devices through our radioloyaltytm app but we do not currently generate significant mobile advertising revenues management believes that mobile advertising represents an opportunity for the company in the coming years and on an ongoing basis management expects the mobile advertising market will grow at substantial rates in the coming years however many challenges exist in this market we believe these challenges will be solved primarily with new technologies we believe our current technologies and other technology under development will solve some of these challenges by solving these challenges we will be able to monetize the mobile listenership we are growing today table of contents in june  the company received an office action where the examiner laid out new grounds of rejection addressed to the new claim language from our previous amendment to us app no   watch this  rad claims    and  were rejected under  usc a as being unpatentable over us  filed  by flather in view of us  filed  by ahanger et al in view of us  filed   by baldeschwieler et al in view of us  with priority to  s filed by briggs et al the company had until june   to respond to this decision and while the company believes that its claims are patentable it choose not to pursue the claims further because it would have been cost prohibitive the company is exploring alternative options as it relates to the watchthis technology on february   the company sold the domain name wwwwatchthiscom for  while the uspto has rejected our claims put forth management believes that the viability of the technology is still feasible currently we have stopped development of this product until management identifies all of the options that are available for the business to potentially pursue in november  we completed an asset purchase of robotfruit a mobile loyalty and application platform robot fruit provides a complete saas based mobile platform for publishers and content owners to directly sell their mobile web and inapp ad inventory on leading

sports games have been an integral part of the sports industry for decades now the rapidly expanding daily fantasy or dfs industry is quickly becoming the new alternative with sports fans industry leaders have reported annual growth of daily fantasy sports of close to  over the past several years with in excess of  million active players according to the fantasy sports trade association fsta daily fantasy sports revenue in  was around  billion and is projected to grow to  billion by  with endorsements by professional sports organizations including the nfl mlb and nba along with credible media outlets and organizations including yahoo cbs rotowire and more daily fantasy sports is quickly becoming commonplace we believe there is a large and growing market opportunity for our ampedfantasy fantify and sportsalert products the company received a final office action rejecting the companys claims to us app no   ads with media streams  rad key metrics we track listener hours because we believe it is the best key indicator of the growth of our platform business revenues from advertising through our platform represented substantially all of our revenues for the nine months ended may   we also track the number of active users on our platform as well as the radioloyaltytm app as indicators of the size and quality of our audience which are particularly important to potential advertisers we calculate actual listener hours using our internal analytics systems some of our competitors do not always calculate their listener hours in the same way we do as a result their stated listener hours may not represent a truly comparable figure player launches are defined as the number of individual times the universalplayertm was launched registered users are defined as the number of users who have signed up for an account with us in order to access our broadcasters content and to earn loyalty points the number of registered users may overstate the number of actual unique individuals who have signed up for an account with us in order to earn loyalty points as an individual may register for and use multiple accounts under unique registration information this is in breach of our terms and conditions but we may not be able to effectively manage and authenticate registration information in order to ensure each user is a unique individual we define registered users as those who have signed up with us to receive loyalty points we calculate this by the number of submissions we receive from users signing up for our loyalty service we calculate listener hours as follows when the universalplayertm is launched a session is created  this is considered the listeners start time at one minute following the launch of the universalplayertm we record  minute of listening time if a session lasts between  and  seconds we record  seconds of listening time at tenminute intervals following the session being created we count each  minute period as listening time so for example if a user launched the universalplayer tm at am we will recognize  minute of listening time at  then  minutes of listening time at   minutes at  etc stations are defined as the total of all stations created by broadcasters that utilize the platform a single broadcaster may create many stations and these stations may be active or inactive table of contents events are user interactions such as a  minute interval clicking song likedislike sharing what they are listening to checking the news through our news app in the player etc the last event we see for the user is considered the end of their session we then take that time minus the time the session started to determine how long the session is so for example if a user launched the universalplayer tm at am and liked a song at am but exited the player at am we would recognize  minutes of listening comparison of the nine months ended may   and may   for the nine for the nine months ended months ended may   may   revenue

these costs but management cannot be certain that it will succeed in entering into such arrangements management may potentially make a business decision to move forward delay or cancel certain partnerships because of the companys overall capital needs nonetheless the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the successful execution of the business plan and

all with no seasonlong commitment through sportsalertcom the company owns a subscriber based alert system for various sports with over  registered users users can choose whether they want score updates sent to their mobile phone or email customizable by sport and events   our streaming business model is focused on the following core principles    we barter with audio content providers namely internet and terrestrial radio stations to obtain control and management of their desktop advertising opportunity ad inventory we also routinely purchase any ad inventory the content providers have not previously transferred to us by barter      in exchange for the ad inventory we pay for all internet and mobile streaming costs associated with the broadcasters content that is streamed through our platform we barter in order to scale our business the end result of the barter is that we aggregate ad inventory from broadcasters that management believes can reach substantial size while maintaining a primarily fixed cost structure for our hardware content delivery labor and other costs respectively      we rebroadcast original audio broadcast content through the platform in a streaming media format in desktop and mobile environments by rebroadcasting we ensure that we do not pay any royalties royalties are the responsibility of our broadcasters this is a substantial advantage for us as many of our competitors pay royalties of up to  of revenues generated from licensed broadcast content      we serve advertisements ads within the platform in audio display and video formats in a desktop environment and display ads in a mobile environment using our radioloyalty tm apps      ads are served by our automated systems based on geography and demographics data among others      the primary technology that makes our platform unique in the industry is that we are able to rebroadcast audio content with geographically targeted ads that replace ads served within an original broadcast targeting a listener in a certain geography by having this capability we can also choose to replace audio ads that do not generate as high of ad revenues with videobased ads that generate much higher ad revenues in effect we make the broadcasters original broadcast capable of delivering ads that are geographically targeted throughout a global broadcast marketplace while also utilizing video ads and our proprietary video instream technology to increase advertising rates      all of our primary technology that supports the platform is automated and capable of operating in a live environment audio content is streamed ads are targeted and served audio ads are replaced as needed and video ads replace audio ads as desired and when possible   advertising revenue constitutes the majority of our total revenue representing  of total revenue for the nine months ended may   we anticipate this trend will continue and our revenues will be generated primarily from advertising our advertising revenue for the nine months ended may   was almost entirely derived from advertising delivered on desktop devices   we deliver content on mobile devices through our radioloyalty tm app but we do not currently generate significant mobile advertising revenues management believes that mobile advertising represents an opportunity for the company in the coming years and on an ongoing basis management expects the mobile advertising market will grow at substantial rates in the coming years however many challenges exist in this market we believe these challenges will be solved primarily with new technologies we believe our current technologies and other technology under development will solve some of these challenges by solving these challenges we will be able to monetize the mobile listenership we are growing today      table of contents     in june  the company received an office action where the examiner laid out new grounds of rejection addressed to the new claim

february   the company sold the domain name wwwwatchthiscom for  while the uspto has rejected our claims put forth management believes that the viability of the technology is still feasible currently we have stopped development of this product until management identifies all of the options that are available for the business to potentially pursue   in november  we completed an asset purchase of

opportunity for our ampedfantasy fantify and sportsalert products   the company received a final office action rejecting the companys claims to us app no   ads with media streams  rad   key metrics   we track listener hours because we believe it is the best key indicator of the growth of our platform business revenues from advertising through our platform represented substantially all of our revenues for the nine months ended may   we also track the number of active users on our platform as well as the radioloyalty tm app as indicators of the size and quality of our audience which are particularly important to potential advertisers   we calculate actual listener hours using our internal analytics systems some of our competitors do not always calculate their listener hours in the same way we do as a result their stated listener hours may not represent a truly comparable figure   player launches are defined as the number of individual times the universalplayer™ was launched   registered users are defined as the number of users who have signed up for an account with us in order to access our broadcasters content and to earn loyalty points the number of registered users may overstate the number of actual unique individuals who have signed up for an account with us in order to earn loyalty points as an individual may register for and use multiple accounts under unique registration information this is in breach of our terms and conditions but we may not be able to effectively manage and authenticate registration information in order to ensure each user is a unique individual we define registered users as those who have signed up with us to receive loyalty points we calculate this by the number of submissions we receive from users signing up for our loyalty service   we calculate listener hours as follows when the universalplayer tm is launched a session is created  this is considered the listeners start time at one minute following the launch of the universalplayer tm  we record  minute of listening time if a session lasts between  and  seconds we record  seconds of listening time at tenminute intervals following the session being created we count each  minute period as listening time so for example if a user launched the universalplayer tm at am we will recognize  minute of listening time at  then  minutes of listening time at   minutes at  etc   stations are defined as the total of all stations created by broadcasters that utilize the platform a single broadcaster may create many stations and these stations may be active or inactive      table of contents     events are user interactions such as a  minute interval clicking song likedislike sharing what they are listening to checking the news through our news app in the player etc the last event we see for the user is considered the end of their session we then take that time minus the time the session started to determine how long the session is so for example if a user launched the universalplayer tm at am and liked a song at am but exited the player at am we would recognize  minutes of listening   comparison of the nine months ended may   and may         for the
