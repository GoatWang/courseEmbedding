september 00 august 00 meet gulf power’s new ceo what is in the future for the utility by rick outzen stan w connally jr took over as president and ceo of gulf power company on july  he assumes control of the pensacolaheadquartered utility that provides energy services from northwest florida communities stretching from perdido key to apalachicola and has over 00 employees the georgia tech graduate began his career with southern company in  as a coop student at georgia power’s plant yates and has held positions in various functional areas including customer operations sales and marketing and power generation he has managed plants for both mississippi power and alabama power  most recently connally was senior vice president and senior production officer for georgia power company as the remnants of hurricane isaac passed through the area the gulf power ceo took time to visit with the independent news in his offices that overlook pensacola bay connelly talked about the differences between the southern company utilities the future of the crist plant and whether nuclear power is coming to our area in you worked for all four of southern company’s subsidiaries mississippi power alabama power georgia power and now gulf power how are they different connally i have met the same type of folks in every company that i’ve been in by that i mean they’re dedicated hardworking and trying hard to serve companies when you get to a company like gulf power you find it to even a greater degree there’s a sense of ownership in this company that’s pretty special these people live and work here and are passionate about serving their communities in there has been considerable buzz about gulf power replacing the crist plant in the cantonment area possibly with a nuclear facility what’s the future of that facility connally we’ve been investing in that plant for the long haul when you think about diversity in our generation portfolio having the crist plant in that portfolio is important to us we’re proud to have it and it’s operating very very well in what about a new plant connally we don’t have an immediate need for a new plant but we’ve always got to be prepared when you turn the light switch on in the morning that doesn’t happen because you built the plant yesterday you started building the plant 0 to years ago in the florida public service commission psc denied for a second time in july gulf power’s request for a rate increase related to purchasing land in north escambia county for a new plant how does that impact the prospects of a new plant connally the north escambia land was unique because it really opened all options for us – whether it be natural gas clean coal or nuclear the commission did not approve our cost recovery around that land however they did approve the majority of what we asked for last year we’re evaluating all our options the land we think is still a very strategic piece of property for our customers in what is the timeline for getting a new plant online connally depends on the type of plant a nuclear plant would have the longest lead time and it can take up to 0 years in planning permitting and construction a natural gas plant is less about five to seven years in when will our area need a new plant connally it’s based on the projection of where your load growth is going to be we’ve got teams every year looking at load growth looking at customer growth and where is that customer growth the advantage of the north escambia property is that it’s close to a load center pensacola there are a lot of variables and it is a longrange process load margins are a 0 percent which is where you want it we’re probably looking at  before we need new generation based on what we know today in you serve on the board of directors of the florida chamber of commerce and enterprise florida what role do you plan to personally play in the community connally i see my role as being sure i represent gulf power across the region and across the state our people are already involved i think there are ways i can plug in and compliment them in areas like united way and american cancer society gulf power has always been a part of the fabric of the community i want to strengthen that fabric gulf power presidents   francis b carter    thomas w martin    robert w williamson    eugene a yates    james f
