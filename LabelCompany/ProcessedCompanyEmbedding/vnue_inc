in tandem to enter into deals with venues artists and labels across the united states using this initial launch strategy the collective venue network effect whereby each deal makes the offer more

and further evangelize the creation of the collective network of connected venues that empower artists to create content and monetize it   markets and opportunity   it is estimated that there are over  indie bands performing in the us domestic market alone and while a handful of them will get produced under a label even less will be big enough to attempt to utilize today’s current methods to capture and deliver live performance audio from a given show currently artist bands and performers are missing a simple capture and immediate sell tool kit to deliver high quality audio and video to their fans for each of their live shows   vnue’s goal first and foremost is to empower artists  not only in serving their fans but generating a monetary footprint which can foster the continued creation of their art        table of contents   vnue intends to strategically align an economically viable inhouse digital solution during a golden era of live music by creating a platform and

industry executives record labels music publishers and live performance venues will access vnue’s solution as a service through which they are able to benefit from a range of different revenue models

performances both audio and video or audio separately in addition the revenue stream can also include an advertising or sponsorship component that was integrated into tours this revenue share aligns business outcomes for all parties and means that costs are primarily baked into the software and delivery agent typical revenue shares are expected to range from  percent and vary based on the level of service allocated to each artist label music publisher and performance venue and the scale of the business opportunity secondary revenue streams include fees for storage usage licensing and software upgrades design or social advertising distribution vnue’s revenue share is reported as net revenue ie gross transaction revenues minus any revenue share due to third parties   as a softwarefocused business vnue can take advantage of a single technology platform to continuously acquire users at low marginal cost leveraging artist promotion in venue marketing and mobile notifications further automation and selfservice tools are intended to allow vnue to provide more advanced services to the industry and artist without adding significantly to the cost base or headcount   vnue intends to deliver a technology suite to accompany the publisher that allows them to source and then generate a wide swath of reports down to granular level in venue streams and conversions vnue looks to commercialize the in venue sales components that is currently missing and expand these efforts globally and embed live and ondemand content from the vnue audience network

contents   management believes its enterprise level solution drives the following benefits to customers    vnue super admin – proprietary rights management software that enables granular control of content distribution including by geography personality types and publishers    long term investment – vnue primarily takes a share of customers’ revenue with vnue taking the majority of its fees when

labels venues and artists work with us to adapt their deal based on different revenue models including licensed adfunded and direct to consumer or sponsorship    keep the data – performance data is collated from the foh mobile sandbox super admin and artist admin into one dashboard financial data can be downloaded anytime for any reason full transparency of vnue data is extremely important    vnue audience reach – vnue’s distribution to a preconnected network of publishers enables access to potentially larger audiences   license agreement with universal music corp   on november   the company entered into a license agreement with universal music corp universal the license agreement is effective september   and has a term of two  years from the effective date under the terms of the license agreement universal is granting to vnue a nonexclusive nontransferable nonsublicensable license to create and distribute content using certain universal compositions more specified in the grant of right’s section of the license agreement   the company will then market and sell this content via the vnue service at certain agreed upon price points more specifically described in the business model and price points section of the license agreement and the company shall pay universal royalties for each sale of the content as specified in the royalty rates section of the license agreement   in accordance with the minimum guarantee provision of the license agreement the company was required to pay universal a minimum first year fee of fifty thousand dollars  which is due within  days of execution and a second year minimum fee of fifty thousand dollars  which is due upon the commencement of the second year of the term the company paid the minimum first year fee of fifty thousand dollars  to universal on november   upon mutual agreement of the parties the second payment has been deferred pending certain revisions of the agreement currently being negotiated between the parties   now that the company has paid the minimum first year fee to universal the company’s plan is to continue raising capital through the sales of its common stock in order to complete the development of its vnue service once development of the vnue service is complete the company plans to concentrate on the marketing and sales of content created under the licensing agreement with universal as well as identifying strategic opportunities with other music industry leaders        table of contents   competition   a number of music streaming services exist but these services are not packaging the audio for a fan that is currently at the performance to purchase and enjoy immediately after the show in addition they are not providing services on a cost effective automated basis necessary to provide high quality audio recordings that is cost effective enough to be utilized by artists to cover all their individual shows our main competition is a small group which includes setfm lovelive soundhalo and nugsnet there are some competitors that do post show production audio through a very manual and delayed process that is not available to the fans for days if not weeks after the show and their process is so costly that the artists have to pick and choose certain shows to cover others have attempted to capture live audio at shows and burn the show to a cd for distribution at the show but again this is a very costly and manual process that does not produce enough cds fast enough at a given show to meet the demand we believe the cd process does not scale effectively and cannot efficiently cover every show in a tour nor does the cd process appear to have the capability to cover thousands of bands at once as every show requires a significant amount of equipment and manpower deployed at each show additionally the idea of delivery media on a cd is antiquated and we believe the ability to deliver media on mobile devices is key to capturing today’s market audience in addition antiquated capture and delivery methods have an additional difficulty in that there is a complex back end process of clearing publishing and royalty rights which is difficult for the average band to navigate in order to produce and deliver live show audio to their fans vnue’s acquisition of the lively software provides the technology for a comprehensive solution that addresses these concerns in one automated solution   however there can be no assurance that even if we are successful we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry as we are a relatively small company we face the same problems as other small companies in any industry such as lack of available funds established distribution channels or an established customer base our competitors may be substantially larger and better funded than us and have significantly longer histories of operation and development than us in addition they may be able to provide more competitive products than we can and generally be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in legislation and regulations relating to the industry additionally our competitors may devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products or services than we do increased competition could also result in loss of key personnel reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could harm our business   key business strengths   management believes that the key factors that will contribute to vnue’s success are    the connected venue network preconnected network – vnue has a large and growing preconnected network of partners – over  content owners and over  publishers content owners can quickly access this network of publishers who may want their content and publishers can access a wide range of premium content across the business’ industry verticals    vnue audience innovation – vnue has a team of approximately  people involved in rd tasked with continually upgrading and enhancing the software product to better serve customers’ evolving needs upgrades are easy to deploy due to the platform’s modular design – it has been constructed as a service orientated cloudbased architecture for maximum scalability    advanced services – vnue’s specialist teams offer a range of advanced services including audience development metadata and search engine optimization premium advertising and sponsorship sales live streaming event support and premium support for enterprise customers vnue studios leverages a creative network of content producers talent publishers and brands to identify opportunities for the creation of the best live programming    business model aligned to the customer interests – vnue’s primary revenue model is to take a share of those revenues due to the customer for use of its software and services as well as approved license to package performances within our products aligning vnue success with the success of its customers greatly helps the artist vnue’s strategy is not focused on production inhouse or acquiring rights therefore it does not actively seek to compete with content owners nor does it own bc sites therefore it does not actively seek to compete with publishers    track record of delivering for key reference customers – due to the proposition described above capabilities and customer benefits vnue has signed up a range of established customers the directors believe that a track record of recruiting and delivering for established customers will support further business development activities   employees   we currently have two fulltime and no parttime employees we also currently engage independent contractors in the areas of accounting legal and auditing services corporate finance as well as marketing and business development the remuneration paid to our officers and directors will be more completely described elsewhere our audited financial statements we expect to double the number of employees over the next  month period we do and will continue to outsource contract employment as needed        table of contents   reports to

do prohibit us from declaring dividends where after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend    we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or    our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution   we have not declared any dividends and we do not plan to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future        table of contents    equity compensation plans   in april  we adopted a  stock incentive plan the plan the purpose of the plan is to promote the longterm success of our company and the creation of stockholder value by encouraging the attraction and retention of qualified employees and nonemployee directors encouraging them to focus on critical longrange objectives of our company and linking their interests directly to stockholder interests through increased stock ownership the plan seeks to achieve this purpose by providing for various types of incentive awards to participants we believe it is important to have flexibility to grant various types of equity awards to our employees so that we can react appropriately to the changing environment no securities have been issued under the plan to date   the plan shall be administered by our board until the appointment of an appropriate committee the committee the committee has the discretion to determine the types and terms of awards made under the plan the plan allows the company to grant stock options restricted stock rights restricted stock performance shares performance share units and stock appreciation rights to employees officers consultants to and nonemployee directors of our company on the grant date of the award the total number of shares subject to all awards under the plan is fifteen million subject to adjustment as provided in the plan for stock splits dividends distributions recapitalizations and other similar transactions or events the maximum number of shares that may be granted to a participant in any year is three million if any shares subject to an award are forfeited expire lapse or otherwise terminate without issuance of such shares such shares shall to the extent of such forfeiture expiration lapse or termination again be available for issuance under the plan rules other than for nonsubstantive amendments to the plan the plan also sets out provisions relating to a change in control of the company the nontransferability of awards the forfeiture and

analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the twelvemonths ended december   should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report we are in the process of completing development of our products and services and therefore do not have revenues or income        table of contents   twelve months ended

ended december   the increase represents the necessary development of our software that is the basis for our products and services that we plan to offer as we implement our business plan as well as a decrease in the value of shares issued for services   general and administrative expenses   our general and administrative expenses for the twelvemonths ended december   amounted to  compared to  for the twelvemonths ended december   the decrease in general and administrative expenses relative to last year is due primarily to the decrease in salaries for full time personnel and contract labor caused by our lack of sufficient working capital   acquisitionrelated costs   our acquisitionrelated costs for the twelvemonths ended december   amounted to  in connection with the closing of the merger on may   there were no such costs in    impairment of intangibles   our impairment of intangibles costs for the twelvemonths ended december   amounted to  there were no such costs in    other income expenses net   we recorded other expense net for the twelvemonths ended december   of  compared to other expense net of  for the twelvemonths ended december   the change in net other expenses was primarily due to increased financing costs of  offset by the change in fair value of derivative liability   net loss from operations   as a result of the foregoing acquisitionrelated costs software development expenses general and administrative expenses and other income our net loss for the twelvemonths ended december   was  compared to our net loss for the twelvemonths ended december   of    liquidity and capital resources   since our inception we have funded our operations primarily through private offerings of our equity securities and loans   as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of    we had negative cash flow from operating activities of  for the twelvemonths ended december   compared with negative cash flow from operating activities of  for the twelvemonths ended december   the improvement in our negative cash flows for operating activities for the period is primarily due to greater costs associated with the issuance of common stock for the merger and for services and financing activities for the twelvemonths ended december     we had no cash flow from investing activities for the twelvemonths ended december   we had negative cash flow from investing activities of  for the twelvemonths ended december   due to an advance to a related party   we had positive cash flow from financing activities of  for the twelvemonths ended december   as compared to  for the twelvemonths ended december   the cash flows from financing activities for the twelvemonths ended december   were primarily due to  in proceeds from a convertible note  received from a stockholder and  in proceeds from the issuance of common shares the cash flow from financing activities for the twelvemonths ended december   was primarily due to  in proceeds from the issuance of common shares this  is offset by  in repayments to a stockholder and  in repayments of convertible notes payable during the same period        table of contents   offbalance sheet arrangements   we have no significant offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders   going concern   the company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business as reflected in the consolidated financial statements the company had a stockholders’ deficit of  at december   and incurred a net loss of  and used net cash in operating activities of  for the reporting period then ended certain of the company’s notes payable are also past due and in default these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements were issued the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   management estimates that the current funds on hand along with the funds received after year end as well as from additional sources will be sufficient to continue operations through december  the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company’s ability to execute its strategy and in its ability to raise additional funds management is currently seeking additional funds primarily through the issuance of equity securities and convertible notes for cash to operate our business no assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or if available that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the company even if the company is able to obtain additional financing it may contain undue restrictions on our operations in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stock holders in case or equity financing   we have not generated revenues have incurred losses since our inception and rely upon the sale of our common stock and loans from related and other parties to fund our operations we do not anticipate generating any revenues in the foreseeable future and if we are unable to raise equity or secure alternative financing we may not be able to pursue our plans and our business may fail   application of critical accounting policies and estimates   our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to our financial results and to the understanding of our past and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s estimates and assumptions we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if  it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making our estimate and  changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations see note   significant and critical accounting policies and practices page f herein        table of contents   use of estimates and assumptions and critical accounting estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period critical accounting estimates are estimates for which a the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and b the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information changes in facts and circumstances historical experience and reasonable assumptions after such evaluations if deemed appropriate those estimates are adjusted accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates include the assumptions used to value the derivative liabilities the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset and the accruals for potential liabilities   internal software development costs   development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established the company considers technological feasibility to be established when all planning designing coding and testing has been completed according to design specifications after technological feasibility is established any additional costs are capitalized through december   technological feasibility of the company’s software had not been established and accordingly no costs have been capitalized to date   derivative financial instruments   the company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives for derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations the classification of derivative instruments including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity is evaluated at the end of each reporting period derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or noncurrent based on whether or not netcash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within  months of the balance sheet date   stockbased compensation   the company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and nonemployees in noncapital raising transactions for services and for financing costs the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by fasb where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on the straightline basis over the vesting period the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to nonemployees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the fasb where the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a the date at which a performance commitment is reached or b at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete options granted to nonemployees are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period as the options vest they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting in certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the nonemployee option grants are immediately vested and the total stockbased compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date   the fair value of the companys stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which uses certain assumptions related to riskfree interest rates expected volatility expected life of the stock options or warrants and future dividends compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the blackscholesmerton option pricing model and based on actual experience the assumptions used in the blackscholesmerton option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods   recent accounting pronouncements   see note  of the consolidated financial statement for management’s discussion

the related consolidated statements of operations stockholders deficit and cash flows for the years then ended these financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits   we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement the company is not required to have nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting accordingly we express no such opinion an audit includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion   in our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the company as of december   and  and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america   the consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern as discussed in note  to the consolidated financial statements during the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss and utilized cash flows in operations and at december   had a stockholders deficit these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern managements plans in regards to these matters are also described in note  the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this

contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period critical accounting estimates are estimates for which a the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and b the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop estimates utilizing currently available information changes in facts and circumstances historical experience and reasonable assumptions after such evaluations if deemed appropriate those estimates are adjusted accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates include the assumptions used to value the derivative liabilities the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset and the accruals for potential liabilities   internal software development costs   development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established the company considers technological feasibility to be established when all planning designing coding and testing has been completed according to design specifications after technological feasibility is established any additional costs are capitalized through december   technological feasibility of the company’s software had not been established and accordingly no costs have been capitalized to date   fair value of financial instruments   the company follows the fasb accounting standards codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and to measure the fair value of its financial instruments the fasb accounting standards codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels the three levels of fair value hierarchy are described below     f   table of contents    level  quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date     level  pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable reporting date as of the end of the period     level  pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data   financial assets are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable   the carrying amounts of the company’s financial assets and liabilities including cash accounts payable accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments   the fair value of the derivative liabilities of  and  at december   and  respectively were valued using level  inputs   derivative financial instruments   the company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives for derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations the classification of derivative instruments including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity is evaluated at the end of each reporting period derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or noncurrent based on whether or not netcash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within  months of the balance sheet date   carrying value recoverability and impairment of longlived assets   an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of a longlived asset asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value the carrying amount of a longlived asset asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset asset group that assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset asset group at the date it is tested for recoverability an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a longlived asset asset group exceeds its fair value if an impairment loss is recognized the adjusted carrying amount of a longlived asset will be its new cost basis for a depreciable longlived asset the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset restoring a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited   the company’s longlived asset asset group is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable the company tests its longlived assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events the long lived asset was determined to be impaired at december   and a loss of  was recorded for the year ended december     concentrations of credit risk   financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents the company places its cash with high quality financial institutions and at times may exceed the fdic  insurance limit the company does not anticipate incurring any losses related to these credit risks the company extends credit based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition generally without collateral exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customers financial condition the company monitors its exposure for credit losses and intends to maintain allowances for anticipated losses as required     f   table of contents   loss per common share   basic earnings loss per share are computed by dividing the net income loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year diluted earnings loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued using the treasury stock method potential common shares are excluded from the computation as their effect is antidilutive   for the years ended december   and  the calculations of basic and diluted loss per share are the same because potential dilutive securities would have an antidilutive effect as of december   and  we excluded the outstanding securities summarized below which entitle the holders thereof to acquire shares of common stock from our calculation of earnings per share as their effect would have been antidilutive       december                convertible notes payable                 stockbased compensation   the company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and nonemployees in noncapital raising transactions for services and for financing costs the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by fasb where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on the straightline basis over the vesting period the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to nonemployees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the fasb where the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a the date at which a performance commitment is reached or b at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete options granted to nonemployees are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period as the options vest they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting in certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the nonemployee option grants are immediately vested and the total stockbased compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date   the fair value of the companys stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which uses certain assumptions related to riskfree interest rates expected volatility expected life of the stock options or warrants and future dividends compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the blackscholesmerton option pricing model and based on actual experience the assumptions used in the blackscholesmerton option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods   income taxes   the company follows the asset and liability method which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement     f   table of contents    the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as well as tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards the company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary   management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years if actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary the company’s tax years  to  remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions   pursuant to the internal revenue code section  section  certain ownership changes may subject the nol’s to annual limitations which could reduce or defer the nol section  imposes limitations on a corporation’s ability to utilize nols if it experiences an ownership change in general terms an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than  percentage points over a threeyear period in the event of an ownership change utilization of the nols would be subject to an annual limitation under section  determined by multiplying the value of its stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable longterm taxexempt rate any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years the imposition of this limitation on its ability to use the nols to offset future taxable income could cause the company to pay us federal income taxes earlier than if such limitation were not in effect and could cause such nols to expire unused reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols   recently issued

asu  compensation  stock compensation topic   improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting the amendments in this asu require among other things that all income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled the asu also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employees shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes

characterized the fair value of the conversion features as derivative liabilities upon issuance the company determined that upon issuance of the notes the initial fair value of the embedded conversion

this annual report an evaluation was carried out by our management with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules a€ and d€ under the securities exchange act of  the “exchange act” as of december   disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures   based on that evaluation and the material weaknesses outlined below under internal control over financial reporting our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer concluded as of the end of the period covered by this annual report that due to weaknesses in our internal controls described below our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in recording processing summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information may not be accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures   internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   using the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso   a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december   the company determined that there were deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses as described below    lack of proper segregation of duties due to limited personnel    lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review    lack of adequate policies and procedures for accounting for financial transactions    lack of independent board members    lack of independent audit committee        table of contents   management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above material weaknesses   in light of the existence of these material weaknesses management concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls as a result management has concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by coso   weinberg  company an independent registered public accounting firm is not required to and has not issued a report concerning the effectiveness of our

of ethics our board has found that the fiduciary duties placed on individual directors by applicable legislation and the restrictions placed by applicable legislation on an individual director’s participation in decisions of the board in which the director has an interest have been sufficient to ensure that the board operates independently of management and in the best interests of our company   board leadership structure and role on risk oversight   at present we have determined our current leadership structure comprised of our directors and officers is appropriate due to our small size and limited operations and resources   we have no policy requiring the combination or separation of the principal executive officer and chairman roles and our governing documents do not mandate a particular structure our directors recognize that the leadership structure and the combination or separation of these leadership roles is driven by our needs at any point in time   our directors are

than  of our outstanding common stock our directors and our executive officers and directors as a group to the best of our knowledge the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares except as otherwise noted there are not any pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control   the information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the securities and exchange commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose under these rules a person is deemed to be a “beneficial owner” of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security a person is deemed to own beneficially any security as to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within  days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible security warrant option or other right more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities the percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within  days by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within  days consequently the denominator used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner except as otherwise indicated below we believe that

indemnified as provided by the nevada revised statutes and our bylaws we have been advised that in the opinion of the securities and exchange commission indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act is against public policy as expressed in the securities act and is therefore unenforceable in the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities is asserted by one of our directors officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered we will unless in the opinion of our legal counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
