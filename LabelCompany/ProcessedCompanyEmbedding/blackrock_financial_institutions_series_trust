economy has settled into a steady growth rate slightly above the postcrisis trend in fact our blackrock gps suggests g growth over the coming year is set to comfortably exceed current consensus forecasts investors may want to embrace the implications of a durable economic expansion and favor risk assets like stocks over bonds three themes to consider sustained expansion we believe the current cycle won’t die of old age any time soon the economy still has slack for the recovery to chug on rethinking risk low volatility is no cause for alarm in and of itself placid markets are the norm when the economic backdrop is benign rethinking returns longterm bond yields are likely to remain low this suggests stock valuations may not snap back to historical averages  sustained expansion the current us economic cycle has been unusually long sparking fears that it may die of old age we have a different take looking at the quantity of recovery rather than the time it has taken reveals an economy with ample slack to power on its remaining lifespan may be clocked in years not quarters room to runcomparison of us economic cycles from peaks to troughs  sources blackrock investment

recent lows plumbed by volatility measures such as the vix for the sp  and move for us treasuries for some this calm is causing consternation surely markets must obey the principle of mean reversion and volatility should march back to more “normal” levels however this popular line of reasoning features a flaw markets are typically docile when the economic backdrop is benign low volatility  with a long taildistribution of realized monthly us equity volatility  sources blackrock investment institute with data from robert shiller june  notes realized volatility is calculated as the annualized standard deviation of monthly changes in us equities over a rolling month period bars show the number of months at each level of volatility each bar represents a bucket of two percentage points in realized volatility for example the bar marked – shows that volatility was between  and  for  months this isn’t to suggest complacency is warranted spikes in volatility happen with some frequency and present real risk for flightier investors however a sustained shift into a high volatility state may require a real growth scare or systemic financial threat as neither looks imminent at least as we parse the signals dialing down risk in portfolios today may leave investors tilting at windmills take action keep calm but hedge on pairing stocks and bonds remains a prudent risk management play more

make better financial decisions you solidify your relationships and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge blackrock has resources to guide you through these conversations and to assist you create a transparent documented process lay the foundation with our objectivesetting worksheets risks it’s important to contemplate portfolio risk in two dimensions how much risk should be taken and what types of risk are tolerable in the portfolio these two questions should be used dynamically when working with clients to regularly align their objectives with the amount of risk they are willing to take to achieve them discover how we see and analyze risk costs portfolio costs come in two categories fees transaction costs and management fees and taxes each of these eat into the returns a portfolio generates advisors that build a documented cost budget into their portfolio construction process can limit the impact of this erosion and ensure they are incurring costs only when justified learn how to capture the best value across investments view transcript you’ve heard it before … eat right … exercise … get regular checkups and you know that to be healthier you should do those things but what if there was a regulation that said you must do those things the department of labor fiduciary rule underscores the importance of understanding your client’s personal and financial retirement objectives and building a portfolio based on that shared understanding as erisa fiduciaries advisors will need to demonstrate the value of the services they offer for the fees they charge … and it starts with meaningful personal relationships and deep understanding of client circumstances because these circumstances are what drive their financial objectives when you look deeper spend the extra time with clients … when you help them make better saving spending and investing decisions … you solidify your client relationships make them clients for life and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge research from morningstar shows that investors who make intelligent financial planning decisions achieve better outcomes they call it portfolio “gamma” and as a fiduciary working to deeply understand client objectives … and regularly affirming those objectives  may be the most important thing you do with clients this is where you can add significant value … or gamma … to the client relationship consider a process where you start by understanding the future purpose of the client’s money why are they investing how much to they need in what timeframe then assess different actions a client may need to take over time in order to achieve their desired goals do they need to work longer spend less or modify how they’re investing you and your client need to know their current cash flow to help determine how much … or how much more … they can save and invest and if retirement is the primary goal understanding future cash flow can be more complicated part of complying with dol’s new regulation is having a documented process … that is transparent … to help address each client objective if your firm has a form for this please use it however if not blackrock has resources to guide you through your process – including several worksheets that you can access here – to help you demonstrate your value proposition add gamma to your client relationships and meet your obligations as a fiduciary understanding the dol rule the department of labors dol fiduciary rule also known as the “conflict of interest” rule extends fiduciary status and responsibilities under the employee retirement income security act of  erisa to a broader range of services relating to retirement assets including iras as a fiduciary under erisa it is important for advisors and their firms to be able to demonstrate that each recommendation they make is in the best interest of the client at its core the rule is intended to increase protections for individual investors by ensuring advisors are acting in their clients best interest and by addressing conflicts of interest many wealth management firms are providing advisors with specific resources regarding the dol rule regularly consult with your home office or legal counsel for guidance on the rule’s impact read the full rule and exemptions here when will the dol rule apply and what does that mean the fiduciary standard within the dol fiduciary rule goes into effect on june   full implementation of much of the detail of the rule has been delayed until january   the delay will allow the dol to receive further comments from the public and conduct additional analysis on the best way and the timeframe to implement this fiduciary standard furthermore the sec has recently sought public comment on the appropriate standard to be applied across all investment accounts which may impact the rule’s full implementation in the transition period between june  and january  advisors are required to adhere to an “impartial conduct standard” for retirement accounts which requires them to provide investment advice in the investors best interest receive no more than reasonable compensation and avoid misleading statements to investors about recommended transactions between now and january  the dol said it will not pursue claims against fiduciaries who are working in good faith to comply while it conducts an economic and legal analysis of the rule’s impact what does it mean to be an erisa fiduciary are there exceptions under the rule erisa fiduciaries must comply with erisa’s prohibited transaction rules or operate under specific exemptions where available in other words simply disclosing or receiving consent for the conflict will not make it permissible intermediaries who are fiduciaries are precluded from receiving compensation that varies depending on the investment product or program absent a specific exemption absent an exemption prohibited transactions under erisa include dealing with client assets for a fiduciary’s own interest or own account acting on both sides of a transaction receiving any consideration for a fiduciary’s own account in connection with a transaction involving client assets the fiduciary rule does contain key exemptions and one is particularly important the best interest contract bic exemption allows erisa fiduciaries to receive otherwise prohibited payments ie receive variable compensation provided that the advisor meets certain conditions and adheres to an “impartial conduct standard” to rely on the bic and provide advice relating to ira accounts an advisor and firm must act in the client’s best interest and charge reasonable compensation not use inappropriate incentives to favor certain products or services provide extensive disclosure of all payments received from providers not prohibit clients from engaging in classaction litigation to resolve claims  enter into a written contract which contains these terms and more the disclosure and contract requirements will not be enforced until january   more steps to take transition from brokerage to advisory transition from brokerage to advisory scale your fiduciary practice scale your fiduciary

outlook jul   by blackrock investment institute the global economy has settled into a steady growth rate slightly above the postcrisis trend in fact our blackrock gps suggests g growth over the coming year is set to comfortably exceed current consensus forecasts investors may want to embrace the implications of a durable economic expansion and favor risk assets like stocks over bonds three themes to consider sustained expansion we believe the current cycle won’t die of old age any time soon the economy still has slack for the recovery to chug on rethinking risk low volatility is no cause for alarm in and of itself placid markets are the norm when the economic backdrop is benign rethinking returns longterm bond yields are likely to remain low this suggests stock valuations may not snap back to historical averages  sustained expansion the current us economic cycle has been unusually long sparking fears that it may die of old age we have a different take looking at the quantity of recovery rather than the time it has taken reveals an economy with ample slack to power on its remaining lifespan may be clocked in years not quarters room to runcomparison of us economic cycles from peaks to troughs  sources blackrock investment institute with data from us bea congressional budget office national bureau of economic research nber july  notes this chart compares real us gdp with

noise has been made around recent lows plumbed by volatility measures such as the vix for the sp  and move for us treasuries for some this calm is causing consternation surely markets must obey the principle of mean reversion and volatility should march back to more “normal” levels however this popular line of reasoning features a flaw markets are typically docile when the economic backdrop is

calculated as the annualized standard deviation of monthly changes in us equities over a rolling month period bars show the number of months at each level of volatility each bar represents a bucket of two percentage points in realized volatility for example the bar marked – shows that volatility was between  and  for  months this isn’t to suggest complacency is warranted spikes in volatility happen with some frequency and present real risk for flightier investors however a sustained shift into a high volatility state may require a real growth scare or systemic financial threat as neither looks imminent at least as we parse the signals dialing down risk in portfolios today may leave investors tilting at windmills take action keep calm but hedge on pairing stocks and bonds remains a prudent

as a fiduciary understanding the dol rule the department of labors dol fiduciary rule also known as the “conflict of interest” rule extends fiduciary status and responsibilities under the employee retirement income security act of  erisa to a broader range of services relating to retirement assets including iras as a fiduciary under erisa it is important for advisors and their firms to be able to demonstrate that each recommendation they make is in the best interest of the client at its core the rule is intended to increase protections for individual investors by ensuring advisors are acting in their clients best interest and by addressing conflicts of interest many wealth management firms are providing advisors with specific resources regarding the dol rule regularly consult with your home office or legal counsel for guidance on the rule’s impact read the full rule and exemptions here when will the dol rule apply and what does that mean the fiduciary standard within the dol fiduciary rule goes into effect on june   full implementation of much of the detail of the rule has been delayed until january   the delay will allow the dol to receive further comments from the public and conduct additional analysis on the best way and the timeframe to implement this fiduciary standard furthermore the sec has recently sought public comment on the appropriate standard to be applied across all investment accounts which may impact the rule’s full implementation in the transition period between june  and january  advisors are required to adhere to an “impartial conduct standard” for retirement accounts which requires them to provide investment advice in the investors best interest receive no more than reasonable compensation and avoid misleading statements to investors about recommended transactions between now and january  the dol said it will not pursue claims against fiduciaries who are working in good faith to comply while it conducts an economic and legal analysis of the rule’s impact what does it mean to be an erisa fiduciary are there exceptions under the rule erisa fiduciaries must comply with erisa’s prohibited transaction rules or operate under specific exemptions where available in other words simply disclosing or receiving consent for the conflict will not make it permissible intermediaries who are fiduciaries are precluded from receiving compensation that varies depending on the investment product or program absent a specific exemption absent an exemption prohibited transactions under erisa include dealing with client assets for a fiduciary’s own interest or own account acting on both sides of a transaction receiving any consideration for a fiduciary’s own account in connection with a transaction involving client assets the fiduciary rule does contain key exemptions and one is particularly important the best interest contract bic exemption allows erisa fiduciaries to receive otherwise prohibited payments ie receive variable compensation provided that the advisor meets certain conditions and adheres to an “impartial conduct standard” to rely on the bic and provide advice relating to ira accounts an advisor and firm must act in the client’s best interest and charge reasonable compensation not use inappropriate incentives to favor certain products or services provide extensive disclosure of all payments received from providers not prohibit clients from engaging in classaction litigation to resolve claims  enter into a written contract which contains these terms and more the disclosure and contract requirements will not be enforced until january   more steps to take transition from brokerage to advisory transition from brokerage to advisory scale your fiduciary practice scale your fiduciary
