reference to the hedgehog and the fox an essay by isaiah berlin which examines tolstoy’s view of history in war and peace tolstoy’s interest in history began early in his life it seems to have arisen not from interest in the past as such but from the desire to penetrate to first causes to understand how and why things happen as they do and not otherwise from discontent with those current explanations which do not explain and leave the mind dissatisfied from a tendency to doubt and place under suspicion and if need be reject whatever does not fully answer the question to go to the root of every matter at whatever cost ‘the hedgehog and the fox’– isaiah berlin echinus advisors llc  convergence  optimal performance search for search for  industry infrastructure cost meter email
