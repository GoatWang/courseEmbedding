francisco — salesforcecom has named tony prophet as its first chief equality officer to focus on initiatives to bring greater diversity to the business software companyprophet a former microsoft and hewlettpackard executive will report directly to salesforce chief executive office marc benioffthe highprofile appointment reflects the growing emphasis silicon valleys technology companies are placing on addressing the lopsided demographics of the industry prophet —who sits on the board of gannett the parent company of usa today — most recently served as microsofts corporate vice president of education marketingso excited to join the salesforceohana as it does great things in the community and the world httpstcovwbtyue— tony prophet tonyprophet september  i always walk into headquarters of companies all over the world and i always look at their values everyone knows at ford that quality is job one at salesforce equality is job one benioff told usa today thats why you need a senior executive running this missionprophet a prominent africanamerican tech executive was coexecutive sponsor of blacks at microsoft and founding executive of blacklight an organization for black marketers at microsoftmarc has firmly planted a flag that a corporation can be a force for good in society and now hes extending that by creating this smart platform for driving not just inclusion and diversity but driving equality prophet told usa todayprophet pledged that racial diversity would be a heightened priority at salesforcecom which came under fire last year from people of color for focusing diversity efforts on closing the gender gapusa todaysalesforces benioff calls for racial equality in techearlier this week benioff called on the tech industry to strive for greater racial equalityin the tech industry we especially have not done well on racial diversity benioff said i really believe a big reason for that is we havent focused on itrev jesse jackson who has pressed the tech industry to hire more women and underrepresented minorities said he was pleased that salesforce had appointed prophetsalesforce is making a deep dive into racial equality jackson saidbenioff is a nationally known philanthropist credited with kicking off a new era of corporate social activism among leading chief executives particularly on gay rights benioff says the  business of business is to improve the state of the world now hes turning that activism inwards appointing prophet to spearhead efforts to make salesforce more representative of society at largea company like salesforce has to be fighting for more equality at every level and for every person benioff said the work of diversity is a constant struggle and it requires somebody senior dedicated to this not just somebody who is kind of functional in the hr organization but really somebody who is going to work directly for the ceo because these are big difficult issues that today are paramount to the overall success of the company and the worldusa todaybenioffs new philanthropic mission the oceansclosing the gender and racial gap as they compete in an increasingly global marketplace has become a pressing challenge for tech companies especially in silicon valley salesforcecom suffers from the same lack of diversity as other major tech companies at salesforce seven out of  employees and eight out of  senior leaders around the globe are men in the us  of salesforce employees are african american and  are hispanicqa with tony prophetprophet spoke with usa today about his new role as chief equality officer the interview has been edited and condensedon why he took the jobi have been watching marc and just following the amazing things he has done in the world of philanthropy and obviously watching the business accomplishments and then when marc really started putting an emphasis on lgbtq issues i really started paying attention to the impact he was havingthis spring a mutual acquaintance of ours died bill campbell i was just thinking about icons and how you never get a chance to tell someone how much of an impact theyve had and what a role model theyve been and so i just sat down and just wrote marc a note and i said marc tough week bill died you will never know the impact you are having on tens millions of people let me tell you one thats my son my son is lgbtq transgender you are opening doors for my son whos this year going to college and as a transgender person had to stand up on the dorm floor and had to tell everyone on the floor i need those bathrooms to change because i dont feel comfortable using either one of them you opened those doors for my son that really accelerated the dialogue for marc and i he was moved by this from that point that conversation was like a snowball and here i amon why salesforce has a chief equality officer i see a natural progression from diversity to inclusion to equality diversity is a given that we are driving for that inclusion certainly but to drive for equality — equal rights equal opportunity equal advancement equal pay — is the ultimate goal i think the title signals the strategy and the intent for what we are working to drive and create at salesforce and foster around the worldon the challenges head for the tech industrywhen you look across the tech industry for some demographics we have relatively low representations thats the initial challenge i am confident we will break through that challenge and you are seeing great progress on some dimensions and work to do on others but i think the next challenges will be around creating inclusive dialogues inclusive environments where all opinions are weighed and matter around the tableone of the great things about salesforce is its a very dynamic company thats shown its agility when it sets its mind and its resources against an issue problem or challenge and really quickly is able to rise to the challengeon salesforce making racial diversity a priorityit has certainly been a priority in the past and i would say its going to be a heightened priority of all the dimensions its certainly one that marc and i have talked about as well as gender as well as lgbtq issues so i think you will see a heightened focus on it i think the numbers are comparable across the industry so there is a tremendous amount of work to be done across the industryfollow usa today

of education the corporate vice president of education marketing at microsoft shares his own career lessons and explains how technology is transforming classrooms around the world by jen swetzoff even as a child tony prophet was a quick learner and a fast adapter — skills that have served him well in the corporate world of consulting aerospace clean energy and technology before prophet turned  his father’s career in the us army took their family from oklahoma to germany then to ohio back to oklahoma then to illinois then michigan they finally made a home in lansing mich and remained there throughout prophet’s middle and high school years prophet did well academically and was recruited to the fiveyear coop program at kettering university which was then known as the general motors institute in flint mich he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering after that prophet attended stanford’s graduate school of business under a general motors fellowship “business school is where i was first exposed to opportunities outside the industrial world — including consulting” prophet said in  he started his career in the operations practice at booz allen hamilton based in san francisco and was named partner after six years just two years after that in  he was recruited to alliedsignal and there led a startup subsidiary — later honeywell power systems the company was focused on unlocking the potential of aerospace technologies such as fuel cells and small gas turbine engines for electric and hybrid electric vehicles as well as distributed clean power generation “being a leader in the foundation of the clean energy movement was a career highlight for me” prophet said in  he moved to united technologies ultimately leading worldwide operations for the carrier corporation business there later he tackled the senior operations role at hewlettpackard where he rearchitected the company’s supply chain and implemented a range of social and environmental initiatives that improved the lives of workers and the quality of the environment today prophet is the corporate vice president of education marketing at microsoft based in redmond wash where he lives with his wife and children he also serves on the board of directors for gannett and volunteers with nonprofits to motivate lowincome teens to obtain a college education during a recent wideranging conversation with strategy prophet discussed the crosssector value of operational expertise why healthcare and education equity are good for business and the importance of doing homework tell me a bit about your work at microsoft there are  billion students on the planet today and education is a clear priority for microsoft every day we focus on building immersive and inclusive learning experiences to “empower every student on the planet to achieve more” we’ve got three amazing scale platforms in office  windows  and our azure cloud — and we’re using these platforms to enable teachers and empower students around the world that’s no small task what’s the most fulfilling part of your work it’s very exciting for me to come in to work every day and know we are truly changing lives and impacting society in the most important ways i’m thrilled by the opportunities i’ve had to meet with students and educators and know that we are truly making a difference i’m super proud of the work we do what’s the most critical impact you see technology having on education technology is the great equalizer it’s flattening the world if a classroom has access to the internet and affordable devices the information available through distance learning can bring nearly the same education opportunities to students anywhere in the world regardless of socioeconomics or geopolitics it is absolutely closing divides and leveling the playing field but there must still be significant challenges on that front absolutely across the world i’d say the largest obstacle is access to the internet second is ensuring that societies around the world honor the basic right of all children to a quality education that’s still not happening in many places particularly for young women i firmly believe that both boys and girls in every country on the planet deserve a great education finally the skills required to succeed are changing quickly the “ rs” reading writing and ‘rithmetic are no longer enough tomorrow’s career will require the “ cs” — creativity collaboration critical thinking communication and computational thinking those are the stcentury skills what did you learn as a consultant that still resonates with you today knowing how to collaborate and work in a team has been incredibly valuable for me as i’ve gone to different companies throughout my career — tackling new subject matter and new roles — having the thought process rigor elasticity of thinking and openness that i learned as a consultant has helped me adapt and ramp up in vastly different situations and with a great variety of people what was one of your career highlights at booz allen hamilton i’m most proud of the team we built and relationships that have lasted more than a quarter century the firm hired the most incredible people and we had an allstar team — brilliant dedicated and diverse in  the work of our team was honored with the professional excellence award i’ve been so proud to watch colleagues’ careers flourish and see their broader impact over the years after eight years with booz allen hamilton why did you decide to move on about two years after i was named partner i was presented with a highimpact strategy role at alliedsignal it was just a natural fit based on my interests my skills and the people i met alliedsignal was a client and had great market positions i felt i couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with the worldclass leadership team there how did you transition from aerospace to technology ultimately the operations thread is what connected my career across four different industries — aerospace power generation air conditioning and refrigeration and personal computers getting that deep functional expertise at booz allen was a foundational experience that carried me through the next  years what do you consider your greatest accomplishment i’m proud of my work at hewlettpackard where we rearchitected the supply chain to improve the lives of our employees because things made in china were generally shipped by sea most of the pc manufacturing industry was initially concentrated in coastal regions over time that drove the industry to a migratory workforce with workers traveling seasonally on trains between their families and our factories it took a bold strategy to move the manufacturing of pcs for hp or a significant part of it into western china where the workers were living so many in the industry said it couldn’t be done but that’s just what we did rather than putting the people on trains we put the pcs on the trains—working with the chongqing government and the governments of kazakhstan and russia and the railway company deutsche bahn — and together we created what’s now known as the “new” silk road it’s a transcontinental railway that cut weeks of transit time off the previous transsiberian route today there are new silk road trains departing nearly every day from chongqing destined for europe this transformation of the industry was good for our workers and it was good for business it helped solve the tough issues we were facing like absenteeism labor availability and labor costs over the short and long terms around the same time we created the her health enables returns program which offered education and training programs for tens of thousands of young women from mexico to china that focused on reproductive and other women’s health issues outside china we worked hard to bring visibility to conflict minerals particularly in africa we demanded to know where the minerals that went into our electronic devices came from and where the money was going i’m very proud to have led and championed that effort how would the people closest to you describe you intense deeply curious a champion of equity and someone who tries to have fun along the way when and where are you happiest with my wife and children exercising and volunteering with young people — talking about the lifechanging benefits of going to college tell me more about your volunteer work for the past decade or so my passion project has been trying to inspire and assist lowincome teens to achieve a college education i’ve worked a lot with two incredible organizations in california college track in the san francisco bay area and eastside college preparatory school in palo alto when i speak with lowincome high school students i often say “i am not much different from you” i show them a picture of the humble home where we lived in rural oklahoma “maybe it’s a little better or maybe it’s a little worse than where you live but i’m sure it’s not that much different what did i do to get where i am today i focused on education that’s the secret for success do your homework turn it in on time and if you don’t understand your homework go see your teacher” if kids just do those three things our education system in the us generally works there are so many great examples and i count myself as one you can’t control where you start but you alone can determine where you finish what motivated you as a young person i had great role models my mother was a home economics teacher for decades and my father went back to school as an adult thanks to the gi bill through hard work and perseverance at night school he earned his bachelor’s and his master’s and continued to a phd from northwestern university he became the superintendent of public education for lansing michigan and he later became the superintendent of public education for portland oregon i’m so proud of his accomplishments because it was far from an easy road eighty years ago my father was growing up in rural mississippi — and for him as a young africanamerican man compulsory k– education didn’t exist the core of his education included civil war history and agriculture his only economic opportunity was to skip school and work in the fields picking cotton if he picked  pounds of cotton he earned  and that was real money in
