literature  daxor navigation daxor the blood volume company search for bva product literature highlights of the bva the bva calculates true normal blood volume for a specific individual the bva directly measures circulating blood volume in  minutes or less individuals of different body sizes may have identical hematocrits but vastly different blood volumes accurate knowledge of blood volume can prevent serious complications from undertransfusion caused by unrecognized severe hypovolemia the bva is the first instrument for the measurement of human blood volume to receive patents in the us european common market and japan the bva helps differentiate the postsurgical normovolemic anemic patient from the anemic hypovolemic patient the bva can accurately ascertain individual patient’s presurgical blood volume status to enable more precise fluid replacement during and after surgery the bva provides objective data upon which physicians can base decisions to transfuse reducing unnecessary use of blood products and physician liability the bva reduces morbidity from potentially contaminated blood by avoiding unnecessary transfusions the bva is useful in measuring blood volume in conditions complicated by fluid retention such as hepatic and renal disease product specifications overview specifications requirements accuracy the bva ensures accuracy in three ways the max syringe is engineered to deliver a  accurate dose of tracer solution the bva provides advanced statistical analysis of data obtained during testing automatic multipoint calculation with errorchecking and true zerotime blood volume using realtime regression analysis ensures accuracy and the elimination of error the bva automatically provides normal expected blood volumes based on deviation from ideal weight this is easily accomplished by entering height and weight into the computer program patient safety and comfort the bva eliminates the need for potentially harmful retransfusion of labeled blood patient test time ranges from only  to  minutes ease of use timeconsuming steps of blood labeling and preparation of exactly matched standards are eliminated calculations are automatically
