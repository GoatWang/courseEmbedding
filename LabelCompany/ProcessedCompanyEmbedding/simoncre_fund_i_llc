into the world of simoncre and the industry we love news  views tempes centerpoint towers sold for m will be renamed west sixth february   tweet featured in phoenix business journal february   the saga of the unfinished centerpoint in downtown tempe was resolved friday afternoon when clevelandbased zaremba group purchased the property it was the same deal that was supposed to close last october but fell apart because of complicated mechanics lien issues and disagreements with the title company the deal closed about  pm according to mark winkleman chief operating officer of ml manager llc the owner of the property at  pm zaremba announced that the twotower complex in downtown tempe will be renamed west sixth in deference to the formal address of  w sixth st what was intended to be luxury condos will be offered as rentals as soon as the project is completed construction will begin immediately and is likely to take several months “we got it done there were so many documents to sign” winkleman said originally the deal was a fairly simple one with zaremba acquiring the unit project for  million and finishing it but a day before the october closing title company fidelity national title co backed out at issue were an estimated  million in mechanics liens filed against the troubled project in the deal today zaremba paid ml manager  million the same amount it offered previously with ml manager talking  million of that to acquire the mechanics liens back from zaremba now ml manager will pursue its insurance claims against fidelity for those mechanics liens when other costs of closing the deal are put together however investors with ml manager won’t be seeing any take home money winkleman is adamant however that ml manager will be successful in its fight with fidelity and will recoup some of its losses on behalf of investors right now he’s just relieved to have the deal close “this is the hardest transaction i have ever been involved with” winkleman said the story of centerpoint goes back several years when it was funded by mortgages ltd one of the largest commercial construction lenders in the state a large portion of the mixeduse project was completed with about  million in loans but mortgages ltd was unable to fund the estimated  million to  million to finish the development by early  the project was at a standstill and has been ever since in june  in the midst of the economic meltdown the chairman and sole shareholder of mortgages ltd scott coles committed suicide in the weeks following several borrowers forced the company into chapter  bankruptcy protection a year later the company emerged from bankruptcy under the name ml manager that company was created to administer the remaining loans and to foreclose where necessary since then winkleman has been systematically going through the portfolio and mostly foreclosing taking possession and then selling the properties for whatever he could get on behalf of the investors winkleman reached an almost unsurmountable snag with the centerpoint deal when it fell apart last year he wasn’t sure whether the deal would ever get done but vowed to fight fidelity in court for backing away at the previous closing in the new deal first american title and thomas title handled the transaction tags phoenix business journal press release next previous related posts simoncre recognized as a best

our services projects acquisitions insights contact us insights into the world of simoncre and the industry we love news  views community  young jewish funders to make grants march   tweet featured in jewishazcom by salvatore caputo a group of  jewish businessmen and professionals under age  have launched young jewish funders of arizona a giving circle with plans to make grants totaling at least  to jewish organizations in the valley this year the members will pool their resources to make the grants two of the group’s founders — jay chernikoff and joshua simon — told jewish news“we want to show that young people here are interested and involved” said chernikoff  an entrepreneur and real estate investor who moved to the valley in  “this is a nice sharp smart group of guys who want to make phoenix a place where they can live work raise a family and feel good about the community as a whole and their part in it” the group is focused on supporting effective communitybuilding events and projects that engage individuals who are not yet connected with the jewish community he said chernikoff and simon agreed that their group wants to help establish a culture of giving among younger donors but in a form that reflects the experience of their generation the giving circle model would allow them to see the direct effect of their giving something that both said appeals to younger donors “we really want to make a direct impact and be able to say we changed lives locally” said simon who owns two companies and has been a host of mazelpalooza a social event for young jews held on christmas eve for seven years “about half of the people in our group come from places that had stronger jewish communities” chernikoff said and the young funders would like to build similar communal strength here as a legacy for their children chernikoff said he got the idea for the giving circle when he attended the jewish funders network conference in phoenix in april  which some of the other members of the giving circle also attended their discussions ultimately led to this effort in which they sought advice and help from the jewish funders network nationally and worked with bryan kort chair of the jewish community foundation board locally he said “we’re doing an application process” simon said “we’re spending the next  days telling people about this and getting the word out to the community” after narrowing down the applications he said the funders will hold individual meetings with the applicants and as a group make their decisions on what to fund simon said “we all want to be in unison and agreement on helping the community” simon said “i’m very lucky” he added “i’ve been very successful at a young age and i want to do this for the community to thank them” organizations interested in applying for grants from the group may apply at yjfazorg to be considered a proposed project must be scheduled to take place during  and the application must be completed by april
