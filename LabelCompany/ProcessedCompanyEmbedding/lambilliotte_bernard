interview  bernard lambilliotte ecofin we expect explosive development in chinas renewable energy sectors tue    tags  equity long short bernard lambilliotte chief investment officer of specialist utilities and infrastructure investor ecofin says the firms newlylaunched china power  infrastructure fund is well poised to capitalise on the growth opportunities arising from chinas usdbn stimulus spending much of which is being directed toward the infrastructure and energy space gfm what is the background to your company and fund bl ecofin is a leading specialist in the utilities and infrastructure sectors worldwide managing over usdbn across a range of hedge funds longonly funds and mandates and invests through both public equities and private situations the firm has a global team of  utility specialists four of whom specialise in china ecofin was founded in  and has offices in london new york hong kong and geneva the ecofin china power  infrastructure fund is the latest addition to ecofins global utilities investment platform the fund pursues a longbiased longshort equity strategy and focuses on investment in largecap liquid public equities it aims to generate compelling riskadjusted returns in greater china and capitalise on the longterm growth potential in chinas utility and infrastructure space the fund seeks to generate absolute returns through dynamic portfolio construction and sector allocation based on macro and fundamental research the fund was launched on july  with a starting capital of usdm before the launch ecofin was already investing some of its assets in china though its global funds gfm who are your key service providers bl the key service providers for the ecofin china power  infrastructure fund are morgan stanley international and deutsche bank as custodians and prime brokers citi hedge fund services ireland as administrator ernst  young as auditor and simmons  simmons in the uk and maples and calder in cayman as legal advisers gfm have there been any recent changes to the management team bl for the firm overall the only change to the team has been the addition of david silverstein in new york earlier this year he came from merrill lynch where he was the no  analyst in utilities highyield debt as ranked by institutional investor for four of the past five years he brings strong fixedincome expertise to our specialised utilities team gfm how and where do you distribute your funds what is the profile of your current and targeted client base bl for the firm in general we have longterm relationships across the investor spectrum we have more than  current investors spread fairly evenly between north america europe and asia around  per cent of our hedge fund assets under management come from private banks and family offices with the rest from funds of funds and institutional clients we continue to work with a sovereign wealth fund managing a custom longonly mandate and we are developing strong relationships with more institutions especially as we will reach the fiveyear anniversary for our global utilities hedge fund in october the china power  infrastructure fund will be distributed globally gfm what is your investment process bl as with our other funds the china power  infrastructure investment team combines topdown macro analysis and bottomup company fundamental research in making investment decisions and develops investment thesis using both catalyst events and mismatches between valuation and stock price on the macro side the investment team takes into consideration a range of factors such as economic activities interest rates commodity prices and the regulatory environment and assesses the sensitivity of subsectors to each of these macro drivers the team also leverages ecofins global platform as well as the firms dedicated commodity research efforts the investment team is split between london and hong kong and frequently meets with companies in china both absolute and relative valuation metrics are considered in making investment decisions gfm how do you generate ideas for your funds bl ecofins investment strategy in china focuses on subsector allocations the team develops a detailed understanding of the subsectors and isolates key macro and fundamental drivers for each the team also spends time looking at each company including management visits in order to understand key fundamental drivers the combination of topdown and bottomup views leads to a clearly articulated view on subsectors that inform our subsector allocations we have often found our specialist angle enables us to establish views that differ from market consensus and to identify catalysts and valuation arbitrage opportunities gfm what is your approach to managing risk bl the china power  infrastructure fund employs ecofins existing risk management process and technology infrastructure the risk team monitors the portfolio in terms of beta exposure leverage and longshort ratios quantitative models are run to assess the portfolios exposure to a range of factors such as the broader equity market movement and commodity prices gfm how has your recent performance compared with your expectations and track record bl the existing investments in china within the global hedge fund portfolio have delivered performance for the year to date more than  per cent higher than the broader chinese market performance but with  per cent of the volatility going forward we expect the fund to continue to produce superior riskadjusted returns gfm what opportunities are you looking at right now bl the majority of chinas ongoing usdbn stimulus spending will go into the infrastructure and energy space which accelerates longterm growth and also provides catalysts and dispersion among the subsectors gfm what events do you anticipate in your sector in the year ahead bl we will continue to witness the growth effect generated by chinas stimulus spending efforts we expect to see further market liberalisation of manyheavily regulated sectors and tariff reforms as lower commodity prices and an inflationary environment create good conditions for a smoother transition to a more marketdriven system furthermore we expect explosive development in the renewable energy sectors the new renewable energy development targets that the government is setting will drive chinas domestic investment in the sector while at the same time global demand will provide huge opportunities for chinas lowcost equipment manufacturers gfm how will these developments affect your own portfolio bl we see exciting opportunities both on a longbiased basis in selective sectors but also dispersions among subsectors and companies the portfolio will have a clear overweight toward sectors that we believe are likely to benefit from upward tariff adjustments and high growth as well as winners in the renewable energy space gfm are investors expectations moving towards capital preservation bl our investment universe covers the entire value chain from cyclical upstream suppliers to defensive downstream asset operators the defensive portion of our universe which consists of traditional utility companies tends to outperform the market in downturns hence if we take a more conservative outlook on the market we can still manage capital in a way that delivers superior riskadjusted returns in the market overall we do believe that capital preservation and risk management have become more important since the credit crisis however the defensive characteristics of fund allocations in china despite the rally this year is reassuring in the sense that there is capital available to be allocated and any correction is unlikely to be too long or too deep gfm what differentiates you from other managers in your sector bl there is a lack of specialisation in chinas equity market and very few sector specialist funds at the moment this provides a great opportunity for us to extract alpha on companies and industries ecofin has longstanding experience investing in the sectors worldwide and it is the same expertise and understanding of these industries that we are trying to apply to china by investing in us and european companies that form part of the same value chain as chinese companies ecofin forms a more rounded understanding of the demand supply situation for the chinese companies our global commodity market research is also very relevant to their fundamentals gfm do you foresee problems in raising mandates from investors through  if so what factors will drive investors back to your funds bl investors are very cautious and many are facing liquidity constraints themselves capital is scarcer in the current environment and liquidity is becoming a primary concern for investors in this environment ecofins china fund provides investors with dedicated exposure to chinas infrastructure and utility space high liquidity monthly with  days notice and no financial leverage on capital china especially through our sectors offers a rare spot of countercyclical and consistent growth as well as dispersion opportunity amid the global economic slowdown we believe the supportive macro backdrop combined with ecofins specialist fundamental investment approach will enable us to achieve attractive returns gfm do you have any plans for other product launches in the near future bl we continue to think about how we can generate profits for our investors using our specialist investor knowledge across the industries that we cover and across capital structures we believe there are some great opportunities in renewables where we are already quite active and in credit where we have recently added to our team like this article  get the free daily newsletter
