exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant aspects of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the exchange proposes to modify section ix of the exchanges options pricing schedule to delete references to the photo historical data product photo historical is a stored data product and not a real time data feed nasdaq omx stores the data on a server within a technology subsidiary that functions like any vendor that receives and stores real time data feed photo historical is not a facility of the exchange and fees associated with it do not belong in the exchange rule manual background in september  the exchange established fees for its photo market data product photo is a market data product offered by the exchange that provides proprietary electronic trade data to subscribers photo is available as either an “intraday” or “endofday” product photo historical as the name implies is not a realtime product it is a stored product that permits a subscriber to select a particular prior calendar month or months and receive the “end of day” or “intraday” data for each trading session conducted during the calendar months selected like photo subscribers photo historical subscribers receive the following datastart printed page  aggregate number of buy and sell transactions in the affected series for each trading session conducted during the specified calendar months aggregate volume traded electronically on the exchange in the affected series for each trading session conducted during the specified calendar months aggregate number of trades effected on the exchange to open a position  for each trading session conducted during the specified calendar months aggregate number of trades effected on the exchange to close a position  for each trading session conducted during the specified calendar months origin of the orders involved in trades on the exchange in the affected series for each trading session conducted during the specified calendar months specifically aggregated in the following categories of participants customers brokerdealers market makers including specialists registered options traders “rots” streaming quote traders “sqts”  and remote streaming quote traders “rsqts”   and professionals the fee for the photo historical data end of day product for subscribers is  per calendar month selected the fee for the photo historical data intraday product subscribers is  per calendar month selected proposal nasdaq believes that photo historical is not a facility of the exchange within the meaning of the act and that previous proposed rule changes with respect to such photo historical were unnecessary under the act congress enacted the exchange act to impose federal regulation on stock exchanges and included in its definition of “exchange” “the market facilities maintained by such exchange”  the exchange act separately defines “facility” providing that “the term facility when used with respect to an exchange includes  its premises  tangible or intangible property whether on the premises or not  any right to the use of such premises or property or any service thereof for the purpose of effecting or reporting a transaction on an exchange including among other things any system of communication to or from the exchange by ticker or otherwise maintained by or with the consent of the exchange and  any right of the exchange to the use of any property or service” id the commission has not separately interpreted the definition of “facility”  photo historical does not satisfy any of the four prongs set forth in the statutory definition of “facility” first it is not the “premises” of the exchange the term “premises” is generally understood to refer to a building its land and appurtenances second photo historical is not tangible or intangible property of the exchange while the exchange initially distributes the photo product as a facility nasdaq omx stores and distributes photo historical as any vendor would do third photo historical is not used on the exchanges premises “for the purpose of effecting or reporting a transaction” on an exchange fourth phlx in its capacity as an exchange does not hold any right to photo historical other than as the original distributor of such data for which it receives applicable filed fees the exchanges proposal is consistent with past precedent regarding the distribution of historical data specifically in  the nasdaq stock market submitted a proposed rule change to eliminate from the nasdaq rule manual references to historical totalview in that case totalview was a realtime data product that was stored in a nonexchange subsidiary that then redistributed the stored data in the same manner and capacity as any market data vendor the proposal was designated as an immediately effective proposal and was not acted upon by the commission conversely there is no commission precedent for considering the historical data of an exchange to be considered a facility when redistributed by a market data vendor for example when nasdaq separated from nasd the commission was asked to determine whether trf llc which would operate nasds trade reporting facility was a facility of nasd or the nasdaq exchange which together owned trf llc the nasdaq exchange was to be “primarily responsible for the management of the trf llcs business affairs” and all “profits and losses from the trf llc were allocated to nasdaq” id at  see also id at  “the nasdaq exchanges parent company controls the board of the trf llc directs all business decisions provides technology and will reap the economic benefits of the trf llc” nevertheless the commission concluded that the trf llc was a facility of nasd not the nasdaq exchange because the “trade reporting facility is not a service for the purpose of effecting or reporting a transaction on the nasdaq exchange” id at  the start printed page trf llc was instead “a service for the purpose of reporting transactions to the nasd” id similarly the commission concluded that the aces system “a neutral communications service that allows nasdaq members and nonmembers to route orders to one another” is not a facility of the nasdaq exchange the commission deemed it significant that the aces system does not route orders to nasdaq and does not report executed trades on the exchange id the commission emphasized that because the aces system is “not linked to the exchanges core systems including the nasdaq market center” it “is not possible for an order to be routed to the nasdaq market center via the aces system” id accordingly the commission concluded that aces does not have “the purpose of effecting or reporting a transaction on an exchange” within the meaning of the exchange act id the commission has also permitted nasdaq to remove from its rule book fees related to the mutual fund quotation service and the nasdaq index dissemination service both of which disseminated market data not properly considered “facilities” of nasdaq within the meaning of the exchange act given the plain language of the exchange act and the abovereferenced precedents there is no basis in the act for determining that a realtime market data facility of an exchange retains that character when an affiliated vendor redistributes it on an historical basis first the affiliated vendor is not an exclusive processor of such data unlike the data that phlx produces directly second historical data does not provide access or order entry capability to the exchanges execution system nor does it carry information from or about executions currently within the execution system third the affiliated vendor receives the data via an armslength agreement and it has no inherent advantage over any other recipient of such data moreover historical data is available via multiple sources it is a completely voluntary product in that phlx makes it available on a voluntary basis and clients purchase it from nasdaq omx or another vendor only if they voluntarily choose to do so for all of these reasons phlx believes that its photo historical data service is not a facility of a national securities exchange within the meaning of the act and that it is not required under section b of the act  and rule b thereunder  to file rules regarding the applicable charges  statutory basis phlx believes that photo historical is not a facility of a national securities exchange within the meaning of the act and the terms of this service are not rules that must be filed with the commission under section b of the act  and rule b thereunder therefore removing the applicable provisions from the phlx rule book would be consistent with the provisions of section b of the act phlxs proposal to remove photo historical from the rule manual is also consistent with the exchange act insofar as it will have no impact on phlxs or its members compliance with applicable regulations and rules first phlx has no obligation under the exchange act either as an exchange or a vendor to offer photo historical to phlx members having chosen to offer such data and to do so on nondiscriminatory terms imposes no continuing obligation to do so second even assuming phlx did have an obligation to make photo historical available it will continue to do so in the same manner if does now therefore to the extent phlx members utilize photo historical that use will be uninterrupted third there are multiple vendors of historical many of whom are not subject to commission oversight b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act as amended to the contrary phlx believes that this proposed rule change removing from the phlx rule manual a service improperly included promotes competition by removing an impediment to phlxs competition with unregulated market data providers with which phlx competes for these services removing barriers to competition has the potential to promote innovation reduce prices and increase efficiency c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others no written comments were either solicited or received iii date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change and timing for commission action within  days of the date of publication of this notice in the federal register or within such longer period i as the commission may designate up to  days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or ii as to which the exchange consents the commission shall a by order approve or disapprove such proposed rule change or b institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved iv solicitation of comments interested persons
