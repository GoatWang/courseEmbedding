businesses in the natural resources and energy industries mlps own real hard assets critical to the us economy energy mlps are typically formed by larger energy companies to recapitalize lower growth assets they help to finance various portions of the crude oil and natural gas value chains as shown below they typically own transportation and storage assets in these chains and also production assets within the natural gas value chain mlps are a usonly investment because one of their primary features is advantageous us federal tax treatment typically about  of their distributions are taxdeferred though this can change when mlps are included in pooled investment vehicles like closedend funds the total return of mlp investments is typically based on their distributions and on demand for energy because they are highly concentrated in the energy sector however they can be more negatively affected by a downturn in the energy sector in addition their taxadvantaged distributions could be negatively affected by changes in the us tax code regarding treatment of mlps for more information see httpnaptporg the national association of publicly traded partnerships about nuveen mlp closedend funds nuveen currently offers one mlp closedend fund the nuveen mlp total return fund jmf seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a portfolio of master limited partnerships “mlps” in the energy sector the fund believes that mlps represent a timely investment opportunity since mlps typically generate a high level of taxdeferred income and offer the potential for increased distributions and capital appreciation over time to implement its strategy the fund’s portfolio management team combines its topdown strategic investment style with its rigorous bottomup investment process the fund seeks to identify mlps that it believes have the most attractive current yields and total return potential in seeking to mitigate certain key risks of mlp investing the fund may use various hedging techniques consistent with its topdown investment style with the goal of enhancing its riskadjusted total return over the longer term investor profile are these cefs right for you the

of mlps in the energy sector what are potential risks tax risks these funds invest primarily in mlps that pay no separate corporate level tax because they qualify as partnerships under current tax law a change in law or in the business of such mlps that caused them to be treated as taxable corporations could negatively affect fund performance andor distributions energy sector risks the funds invest

text size a larger text size a largest text size a return of capital part i morningstar beginner closedend funds closedend funds perhaps no other closedend fund cef issue is as vexing as return of capital yet it is critical to understand cef distributions have four potential sources interest payments on fixedincome portfolio holdings dividends from equity holdings  realized capital gains  return of capital which comes in different flavors passthrough from master limited partnership investments primarily constructive from unrealized capital gains destructive investors are literally receiving their own capital minus expenses before we delve further into the types of return of capital lets first understand why return of capital may happen fund families understand that its in their benefit for their cefs to trade near or above the nav they also understand that the distribution rate is a large determinant of a cefs discount and premium for their part investors themselves prefer smooth distributions which occur every month or every quarter to annual distributions this gives them regular income payments to facilitate smooth distributions fund families have adopted managed distribution policies equity funds must petition the securities and exchange commission for a rule b exemption rule b refers to a section of the investment company act of  which states it shall be unlawful…for any registered investment company to distribute longterm capital gains… more often than once every twelve months learn how to access the distribution policy and payment for a cef on fidelitycom decisions must be made to successfully operate a managed distribution policy typically an executive committee will forecast the portfolios anticipated income and capital gains for the upcoming year and make regular monthly or quarterly distributions based on that estimate but forecasts can be wrong and estimates can be off this is especially true in the short term in any given period a fund may not have generated enough income or capital gains to meet the distribution so in this case some of the distribution may be made up of return of capital throughout the calendar year funds estimate the breakdown of their distributions but these are only estimates in january shareholders receive a form div with the actual distribution breakdown for the prior year for tax purposes if you see return of capital was employed at your fund this isnt necessarily bad news although investors should avoid funds with consistent use of destructive return of capital to dismiss a cef from investment consideration simply because it has distributed return of capital is unwise first it could be that the fund is simply passing through return of capital from its underlying holdings this is true for funds that invest in master limited partnerships which themselves distribute return of capital to their own shareholders one cef cohen  steers closedend opportunity fof invests in cefs that may return capital and this fundin turnpasses that onto its shareholders second a fund may have unrealized capital gains in the portfolio and the portfolio manager doesnt want to sell a holding just to meet a distribution commitment this is constructive return of capital because the portfolio manager is theoretically at least continuing to invest for a funds total return instead of just for a distribution rate in a third scenario a fund may have hit a rough patch but the board of directors doesnt want to reduce the distribution distribution reductions typically result in a share price decline so directors are usually averse to reducing them unless there is a clear and compelling reason to do so this is why we dont lambaste a fund for using destructive return of capital infrequently before yearend this return of capital estimate may be erased and not even show up on the div form however consistent use of destructive return of capital is a huge red flag especially if the return of capital comprises the bulk of a distribution  morningstar inc all rights reserved the information contained herein  is proprietary to morningstar andor its content providers  may not be copied or
