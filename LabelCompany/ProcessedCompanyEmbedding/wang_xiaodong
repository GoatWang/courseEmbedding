sharing options share on linkedin share on pinterest share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger close martin jacques thursday  march   est our knowledge of china is being transformed with each passing day five years ago virtually the only subject on peoples minds was tiananmen square now nearly everyone knows that the country has undergone a huge economic transformation and that the future belongs to it in a way that was previously inconceivable but knowledge about china still remains of the broadest brush there is little or no perception for example of the political and intellectual debates that shape the attitudes of either the chinese elite or the population at large indeed there is still an underlying assumption that this is an autocracy in which there are no real debates just fiats handed down from on high this is a misconception or at best a halftruth the extraordinary success of china over the past quarter of a century is the product of a sophisticated political leadership highly attuned to the problems and possibilities that it faces and informed by a plethora of debates and arguments those arguments however take place within strict parameters are largely confined to elite circles and are often highly coded the most important recent such debate has concerned nationalism and one of its key figures is wang xiaodong a chinese intellectual in his late s largely as a result of his book chinese nationalism under the shadow of globalisation which was published in  just after the nato bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade which led to angry demonstrations in beijing wang is now widely seen as a leading thinker of the nationalist movement his main target has been what he calls reverse racism or the widespread attitude among chinese intellectuals that denigrates china and looks to the west for the countrys future and salvation in fact this kind of attitude is far from unusual in the asian tiger countries as they have exploded into economic growth they have invariably looked to the west at least initially as their model and their vision the venom of wangs assault on this mentality during a recent visit to london says a lot about the chinese psyche in my opinion this is not very different from hitlers racism the only difference between them and hitler is that they direct this theory against their own race there is of course every difference between selfdenigration and the extermination of another race it is an utterly inappropriate use of the term racism indeed it suggests an ignorance of what racism is an ignorance that typifies han chinese attitudes more generally china  and the han chinese who make up the vast majority of the population  is characterised by a deep sinocentrism when i suggest that terms such as selfhatred or selfloathing might be more accurate wang counters i insist on using the term racism because foreigners dont believe it can happen in china the idea that the chinese are an inferior race we have never had this experience in chinese history before this sense of inferiority is hardly surprising especially after the cultural revolution during which the country took leave of its collective senses wang agrees arguing that reverse racism is strongest among those in their s and s who lived through the revolution those in their s whose attitudes have been shaped by a very different set of circumstances have a very different mentality they have a sense of pride in their nation they care more about national interests they are not unconditional supporters of the united states in short they are products of chinas successful economic growth wang now a pollster has polls to show these generational differences but alas these are still only for restricted circulation for a century and a half china has lived in the shadow of the west and indeed japan as well an intensely proud country which for centuries boasted one of the most advanced civilisations in the world it felt humiliated by its backwardness and above all by its defeats at the hands of the west and japan the extraordinary economic transformation of the past two decades has lent the country a new sense of pride and selfconfidence for the first time for two centuries china is beginning to feel good about itself and as a consequence flex its psychological muscles wang came to prominence in the late s when he was an editor of strategy and management the most important and interesting literary and intellectual journal in china at the time the socalled nationalist debate could hardly have been more central  or sensitive  to chinas future it concerned the most important issue facing the country namely which economic strategy the country should pursue it was an argument that wang lost leading to his sacking from his job as an economics professor at the university of international business and economics in beijing according to wang there were three main positions the first which was ultimately to triumph and become indelibly associated with the leadership of jiang zemin and zhu rongji proposed that the country should embrace globalisation join the world trade organisation and open itself to foreign capital even though it was recognised that this would inevitably cast china at least initially in the role of a lowtechnology manufacturer in the nether reaches of the global economic food chain the second position which was associated with the left emphasised in the face of economic growth the importance of maintaining social equity the third wangs own position argued that the chinese state should pursue a more selective and protectionist approach towards globalisation borrowing from the japanese and south korean experiences in order to prevent china becoming permanently trapped at the lower ends of the global division of labour so what does he feel a decade on has the gamble of high growth and foreign capital worked was he wrong i am an optimist he says i do not think we can yet say that china has already won this bet but the chances of victory are very large because china is already showing signs of moving towards hitechnology under market forces in one sense the argument is far from over wangs real target is what he calls the liberal faction which he describes as proamerican prowealth and prodemocracy  providing that it does not harm their wealth when asked to define what he means by the liberal faction he suggests those members of the elite outside the communist party who occupy the dominant positions in the universities and the media as christopher hughes who is writing a book on chinese nationalism at the london school of economics points out wang is an astute political operator who knows whom to attack and whom not to  he leaves the party well alone at the core of his argument lies the attitude of this group towards the us when it comes to the problem of the national interest chinas liberal faction stands unconditionally on the side of other countries mainly the united states they submit unceasingly favourable reports about the united states that we dont need vigilance towards the americans nor should we develop our national industries we should place our full confidence in the united states for recovering taiwan this is nonsense the fact that america is the pillar of the world situation at present proves that our international order has the structure of a dictatorship at present  china is benefiting  but american foreign policy could change wang believes in globalisation as a way of fulfilling the nationalist ideal of a wealthy country and strong army china is a beneficiary of the present international order we want to preserve the international order in so saying he distances himself from much of the developing world and from the antiglobalisation movement but he constantly warns that american policy may change that china must depend on its own strength his clear message do not trust the united states despite his relative isolation wang is a popular figure in china in chinese terms he says what he thinks he is combative displaying a toughness that has no doubt helped him to survive defeat he is also confident of his own position  and probably with very good reason although he complains that the nationalist position has been largely suppressed by establishment intellectuals and the staterun media  my channels for publishing articles have been very few and often publication has only been possible due to the use of personal relationships  he points to the internet and sites such as bbs bulletin board service to suggest that there is considerable latent support for his position as china takes its place on the world stage it is not difficult to imagine growing support for the kind of arguments presented by wang until now the chinese position has been sotto voce given the countrys abject poverty and underdevelopment deng xiaoping recognised the need to concentrate all chinas efforts and resources on economic development  everything else would depend on its success in this enterprise with extraordinary selfdiscipline this is exactly what china has done for the past  years but it would be wrong to mistake the singlemindedness that china has displayed for its longerterm ambition china is an extraordinarily old and proud culture with a very powerful sense of its own identity successful economic growth is the precondition for the exercise of a wider political cultural and military influence wang xiaodong is unusual in that he asserts this broader perspective with unusual candour but the views he expresses will surely become far more familiar to western ears as china becomes increasingly powerful economically topics china share on facebook share on twitter

regulation of apoptosispart i introduction to apoptosisdownloadthis video subtitled videos englishresourcesrelated articlestranscript txt xlstrouble viewing try it on itunesreport a problemlecture overview apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that plays important roles during animal development immune response elimination of damaged cells and maintenance of tissue homeostasis apoptosis is executed by intracellular proteases named caspases that are activated during the onset of apoptosis by extrinsic and intrinsic pathwaysthe intrinsic pathway is triggered by the release of proteins such as cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and the extrinsic pathway is activated by the binding of deathinducing cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor to its receptor at the cell surface both pathways are regulated at multiple steps to ensure proper apoptosisspeaker bio xiaodong wang is the director and an investigator of the national institute for biological sciences beijing
