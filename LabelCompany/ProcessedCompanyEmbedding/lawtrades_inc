about lawtrades were a new kind of legal company empowering people to pursue their ambitions and challenge conventions every opportunity begins with a problem ours was simple–law firms were too expensive and slow we were law students when we realized there should be a less expensive alternative to law firms and more work flexibility for attorneys where were the solutions as it turns out there was a simple explanation big law firms are known for beautiful offices at prime locations which comes at a premium naturally to cover such high overhead fees rise and clients like you get stuck with the bill moreover law firms operate at partnershipsa century old model that creates armies of associates to subsidize overhead and maximize partner profit we started lawtrades to build something that makes more sense by circumventing traditional ideologies embracing the power of technology and engaging with customers directly we are able to provide high quality services at a fraction of the price of traditional law firms we believe that getting legal help should leave you happy and better informed with extra cash in your pocket it’s pretty straight forward better legal leads to better opportunities raad ahmed  founder  ceo lawtrades raad ahmed founder  ceo ashish walia cofounder  coo amit roopnarine product design lauren woods account executive robert taussig software engineer

protect the unique shapelook and form of your product get a quote ask a legal question talk with guide read reviews acquiring a design patent a design patent lawyer will help you protect the unique shape look and form of a product the design patent does not focus on usefulness and instead focuses on the ornamental design of the invention if the product has no unique or distinctive shape or appearance at the time it was created then it cannot obtain a design patent a design patent allows the owner to exclude others from making using copying importing a design substantially similar to the design claimed in the design patent design patents are granted for the term of  years from the date of issuance  years if issued before 0 and are not subject to maintenance fees like all patents a

not to include saving you time and money you wont waste your time  it can take hours day weeks possibly months to learn patent law aside from that  you may still need to hire design patent lawyers to fix any mistakes committed faq what is required in a design patent application the elements of a design patent application should include  the preamble  a crossreference to related applications if any  a statement regarding federally sponsored research or development  a description of the figures of the drawing  a feature description  a single claim  drawings or photographs  an executed oath or declaration  the filing fee search fee and examination fee can i submit a provisional application for a design patent no provisional applications may not be filed for design patents can i apply for a utility patent and a design patent simultaneously yes while a utility patent protects a the functionality of a product or process a design patent protects the unique visual elements of such product or process as a result design patents are made up of drawings that show the invention and unlike a utility patent application contains very little text what’s the difference between a design patent and a trademark a design patent protects the physical appearance of a product whereas a trademark protects the symbols or words used to identify the product as coming from a particular business is it possible to submit multiple designs in a design patent application no each application is limited to a single distinct claim design if you intent to submit multiple versions of a design then you can attempt to include them but it’s possible that the uspto may restrict your application to one version of the design and require additional applications for the other versions what kind of designs do not qualify for a design patent the following patents cannot receive patent protection  purely functional designs  designs that are intended for items that cannot be seen  designs that have no fixed
