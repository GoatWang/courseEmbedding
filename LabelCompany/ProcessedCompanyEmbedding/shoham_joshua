flexible link manipulators with rigid tip connections to revolute jointsshow abstract hide abstract abstract this paper presents the basis of a mathematical model for simulation of planar flexiblelink manipulators taking into consideration the effect of higher stiffness zones at the link tips the proposed formulation is a variation of the finite segment multibody dynamics approach the formulation employs a consistent mass matrix in order to provide better approximation than the traditional lumped masses often encountered in the finite segment approach the formulation is implemented into a computational code and tested through three examples cantilever beam rotating beam and threelink manipulator in these examples the length of the rigid tips at both sides of each link ranges from  to  of the whole link length the zones of higher stiffness at the link tips are treated as short rigid zones the effect of the rigid zones is averaged along with some portions of the flexible links thereby allowing further simplification of the dynamic equations of motion the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling technique and show the importance of not ignoring the effect of the rigid tipsarticle · jun  said megahedkarim hamzareadcomparison of adaptive control methods for trajectory tracking robotsshow abstract hide abstract abstract the present paper compares sixteen different adaptive control methods for robot manipulators representatives of the different approaches published during the last two decades the comparison is based on simulated results of the selected algorithms implemented on an industrial robot the mitsubishi rvm the simulation emulates tracking control along two trajectories with different conditions ideal implementation without disturbances changes in system parameters external disturbances unmodeled dynamics and speed of motion two different cost functions were defined and weights assigned to errors moments computation cost and margin of stability these functions are calculated for the different control algorithms considered these are then served as the basis for the comparison several algorithms performed better than the others achieving better results for certain operations under different conditions and therefore were selected and recommended for similar tasksarticle · jan  · roboticaa
