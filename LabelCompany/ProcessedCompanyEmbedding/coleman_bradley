and criticism in hamlet no description by kirsten coleman on  november  tweetcomments  please log in to add your comment report abusetranscript of ac bradley and criticism in hamletac bradley and criticism in hamletwho is ac bradleyac bradley also known as andrew cecil bradley was a literary critic and a professor of literature and poetry at the universities of liverpool glasgow and oxford he is also known as one of the most renowned shakespeare critics bradley was born in surrey on march th  he was the youngest of  children from his father charles bradley who was vicar title given to certain parish priests in the church of england of glasbury bradley began his education at cheltenham college in  and went to balliol college oxford as a classic exhibitioner in  in 7 he was elected to his fellowship at balliol and later he was appointed to lecturer in english and then later in philosophy where he remained until  gifford lectures pars in  bradley became the first to hold the chair or literature and history at the university college liverpool he held that position for  years and eventually moved on to glasgow university where he was chair of english and literature in  he had intended to retire but in  he became a professor at oxford for poetry in  he published his famous work of the shakespearean tragedy after he decided to officially go into retirement and devoted himself to his scholarly work bradley died on september nd  and in his will he established a research fellowship for young scholars of english letters gifford lectures pars ac bradleys criticism ac bradleys  criticism of hamlet has been regarded as one of the most influential and eminent lectures of the early s his main focus in his criticism of hamlet was the famed problem of hamlets delay many people believe that hamlets delay in the killing of claudius is because of external forces such as the risks of moving ahead with only the ghosts words for it and the need to bring the king to public justice thus the need to expose the kings guilt in front of the entire court bradley believes that this theory is completely possible until one actually reads the play hamlet never describes any type of external obstacles in the proceedings of the ghosts instructions he assumes that he has the rights and means to carry out those instructions never once did hamlet say that he wanted to bring claudius down in public leithart par another theory that bradley believes attributes to hamlets delay is his conscience hamlet believes that killing claudius is a moral duty however one might believe that hamlet is subconsciously ambivalent about this duty bradley writes “in the depths of his nature and unknown to himself there was a moral repulsion to the deed” bradley considers the thought that perhaps hamlet was confused about the morality of the situation leithart par  bradley also considers the sentimental view of hamlet hamlet is meant to be portrayed as a hero however bradley begs to differ pointing out that hamlet freely insults claudius ran rings around polonius is vicious with ophelia and his mother gertrude and cheerfully sends guildenstern and rosencrantz off to their deaths in england something that is similar to bradleys theory was famous critics of hamlet coleridge and schlegel they believed that hamlet delayed because he was intellectual and “who loses himself in the labyrinth of thought” by kirsten colemanbradley also proposes that perhaps the delay of hamlet is all due to his melancholic emotions this was not his usual state of mind it is not a habitual state of reflectiveness but a temporary state of depression that paralyzes his mind bradley gives off the impression that he believes that hamlet is bipolar when he says “one would judge that by temperament he was inclined to nervous instability too rapid and perhaps extreme changes of feeling and mood and that he was disposed to be for the time absorbed in the feeling or mood that possessed him whether it was joyous or depressed” bradley par  hamlets case of melancholia was brought on by the strain of the sudden death of his father and the quick marriage of his mother so when the ghost comes with his proposition of killing claudius hamlet is not in the proper state of health mentally to fully understand the compounds of that proposition bradley writes “hamlet is disgusted by life and everything in it a disgust that varies in intensity rising at times for a longing of death often sinking into a weary apathy” bradley par  this quote explains a multitude of things his bursts of energy when the players show up it accounts for his often irritability his transitional crazy emotions it also accounts for the fact that hamlet doesnt understand his own in action and reproaches himself in dismay over his unwillingness to avenge his father critical assessments of hamlet dramatic structure feminism religion madness philosophy psychoanalytic dramatic structurehamlet was seen as a very controversial play shakespeare had broken quite a few rules in the making of this play one of the rules had been the rule of action of over character what is meant by this is back in shakespeares time plays were intended to the certain regime in drama you were not supposed to focus on a character as much as you did the action however hamlet is solely based on the character hamlet himself through his soliloquies and his moral struggles that we witness the play is also filled with discontinues and irregularities for example one instant hamlet is resolved to kill claudius the next he is unsure scholars still to this day wonder whether these irregularities are mistakes or purposely put there to add to the chaos and confusion of the play maccary 7feminismmany feminist critics believe that since hamlet believes that his mother is a trollop due to her sudden marriage to claudius he loses his faith in all women treating ophelia as if she were a trollop as well howard many women over the years have defended gertrude believing that gertrude knew nothing about her new husband claudius poisoning her dead husband hamlet it has been said that many men have misinterpreted gertrude believing what hamlet says instead of the actual text of the play there is no clear evidence that gertrude was an adulteress bloom feminists also believe that after the three supreme role models polonuis laretes and hamlet leave ophelia was driven into madness showalter par  it is also said the ophelia went mad with guilt because after hamlet killed her father it fulfilled her sexual desire of hamlet killing her father so that they can be together bloom religionhamlet the play also deals with various encounters with religion in catholicism the ghost describes himself as being slain without receiving his last rites the ghost also reveals that he has been living in purgatory “i am thy fathers spirit doomd for a certain term to walk the night and in the day confind to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purgd away” shakespeare  another occurrence in catholicism is in regards to ophelias burial they question whether itd be appropriate to have a christian burial since those who commit suicide are guilty of their own murder so the real question is whether ophelia committed suicide or not we do not come to a conclusion in ophelias death so the priest tells laretes that they can not give ophelia a full ceremony because they dont know if she committed suicide quinlan madnessone of the most critical themes in hamlet is madness the question in everybodys mind is hamlet really crazy or is it just an anticdisposition some would argue either way scholars compare hamlet to the earl of essex who was executed for attempting to start a rebellion against queen elizabeth hamlet and the earl of essex have been analyzed for its elizabethan ideas of madness relating to treason the earl of essex seemed crazy to elizabethans and admitted to insanity before his death hamlet may as well have been truly insane as well or at least perhaps in the elizabethan sense wofford par  philosophyskepticism the theory that certain knowledge is impossible relativism doctrine that knowledge truth morality exist in relation to culture society or historical context and are not absolute existentialism a philosophical theory which emphasizes the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of free will hamlet is seen as a philosophical character some of the most prominent theories linked to philosophy are relativism existentialism and skepticism hamlet proves that there is a relative philosophy when he says to rosencrantz “there is nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so” shakespeare  7 the idea that nothing is real except for what we create in our minds comes from greece the people believed that nothing could be perceived except through their senses and all men were different so truth is relative an example of existentialism is in the famous to be or not to be speech to be can be read as a question of existence hamlets contemplation of suicide is however more religious than philosophical and he believes he will continue to exist after death finally an example of skepticism can be proven in one of hamlets soliloquy where it states “what is this quintessence of dust” shakespeare 7 during this soliloquy hamlet goes on about how intelligent man kind is however there will always be something to be learned psychoanalysissigmund freud suggests that claudius has shown hamlet the repressed wishes of his own childhood realized which is to kill his own father and to take his fathers place with his mother with these images hamlet realizes that he is no better than the sinner whom he will punish freud the closet scene in hamlet is portrayed in a sexual light when hamlet scolds his mother for having sex with claudius while unconsciously wishing that he could take claudius place adultery and incest is what hamlet hates and loves about his mother freud also believed that ophelias madness after her fathers death was driven by her hopedfor lover freud freud also makes a connection with the play and william shakespeares real life when hamlet was written it was in the wake of his own fathers death which revived his own repressed childhood wishes freud
