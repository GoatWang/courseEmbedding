application also claims priority and is related to pctus filed dec   and is also related to pctus filed nov   the teachings of pctus and pctus are incorporated herein by referencebackground of the invention  current approaches to treating disease by administering therapeutic proteins include in vitro production of therapeutic proteins for conventional pharmaceutical delivery eg intravenous subcutaneous or intramuscular injection or by intranasal or intratracheal aerosol administration and more recently gene therapy  one protein which may be useful in the treatment of platelet disorders is thrombopoietin tpo platelets are small  microns in diameter a nucleated cells which play an important role in primary hemostasis by adhering to and aggregating at sites of vascular damage in addition platelets release factors which are important components of the blood coagulation inflammation and wound healing pathways patients with very low levels of circulating platelets thrombocytopenia exhibit bleeding into superficial sites eg skin mucous membranes genitourinary tract and gastrointestinal tract as a result of mild trauma and are at risk for death from catastrophic hemorrhage occurring spontaneously or resulting from trauma the physiologic role of platelets and the etiology of platelet disorders have been described cf hematology clinical and laboratory practice eds r l bick et al pp  mosby st louis  harrisons principles of internal medicine eds j d wilson et al th ed pp  mcgraw hill new york   thrombocytopenia may be caused by decreased production of platelets by the bone marrow increased sequestration of platelets in the spleen or accelerated platelet destruction decreased production of platelets by the bone marrow may result from destruction of hematopoietic precursor cells by irradiation or treatment with cytotoxic agents during therapy for cancer in addition alcohol estrogens and thiazide diuretics can suppress platelet production druginduced thrombocytopenia furthermore infiltration of the bone marrow by malignant cells and the disorders congenital amegakaryocytic hypoplasia and thrombocytopenia with absent radii tar syndrome can result in decreased platelet production  increased splenic sequestration of platelets may occur as a result from splenomegaly associated with a variety of conditions including liver disease infiltration of the spleen with tumor cells as in myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative disorders and gauchers disease  accelerated platelet destruction and thrombocytopenia may be caused by vasculitis hemolytic uremic syndrome disseminated intravascular coagulation and the presence of intravascular prosthetic devices such as cardiac valves in addition certain viral infections drugs and autoimmune disorders lead to immunologic thrombocytopenia in which platelets become coated with antibody immune complexes or complement and are rapidly cleared from the circulation a number of drugs can elicit an immune response leading to immunologic thrombocytopenia including sulfathiazole novobiocin paraaminosalicylate quinidine quinine carbamazepine digitoxin arsenical drugs and methyldopa  thrombocytopenia is currently treated most readily by transfusion with platelet concentrates although corticosteroid therapy or plasmapheresis can be effective in immunologic thrombocytopenia treatment with platelet concentrates is severely limited by availability of suitable donors and the risk of transmission of bloodborne infectious diseases  as an alternative to transfusion therapy platelet deficiencies could be treated with hematopoietic growth factors which promote proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes the nucleated progenitor cells from which platelets are derived recently cdna clones were isolated which encode the human mouse and dog analogs of a protein purified from aplastic porcine plasma which displays megakaryocytopoietic activity de sauvage f j et al nature   lok s et al nature   bartley t d et al cell   the encoded protein termed thrombopoietin tpo stimulates proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes and induces platelet production in vivo upon injection into experimental animals  methods for the production and delivery of other proteins with therapeutic properties are desirable for example it has been demonstrated that recombinant βinterferon is an effective medication for treatment of exacerbations in patients with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis ms see kelley c l and smeltzer s c j neuroscience nursing   furthermore it has been reported that βinterferon isolated from nontransfected cultured human fibroblasts may be an effective means for preventing the progression of acute nona nonb hepatitis to chronic disease omata m et al lancet    as another example it has been demonstrated that recombinant human dnase i is an effective agent for reducing the viscosity of sputum from cystic fibrosis cf patients shak s et al proc natl acad sci usa   and for improving pulmonary function and decreasing exacerbations of respiratory disease in cf patients fuchs h j et al new engl j med   it has been further suggested that dnase i may be effective in improving respiratory function in patients with other respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis and pneumonia shak s et al  op cit  while tpo βinterferon and dnase i are useful for example in the treatment of thrombocytopenia ms and cf respectively production of therapeutic proteins using genetic engineering technology as taught in the prior art is limited to conventional recombinant dna methods in which the recombinant protein is purified from mammalian cells expressing an exogenous cloned gene or cdna under the control of a suitable promoter the exogenous dna encoding the protein of interest is introduced into cells in the form of a viral vector circular plasmid dna or linear dna fragment chinese hamster ovary cho cell lines and their derivatives gottesman m m meth enzymol   or mouse cell lines such as nso galfre g and milstein c meth enzymol b   or pxag kearney j et al j immunol    are commonly used and the production of human therapeutic proteins is thus accomplished by expression and purification of the protein from a cell of nonhuman origin  in many cases it is desirable to produce human therapeutic proteins in a human cell for example when it is desired that the glycosylation pattern of the protein be similar to patterns normally found on human cells in addition the expression of human proteins in human cells is important in the development of gene therapy methods in which a patients cells are engineered to produce a desired therapeutic protein to alleviate the symptoms or cure a disease  clearly the development of novel methods for the production of these human proteins in human cells would be of benefit to patients through the availability of a wider range of products with therapeutic effectiveness one approach proposed by scientists in the field for accomplishing this goal is to use homologous recombination or gene targeting to introduce a cloned exogenous regulatory element ie a promoter andor enhancer into a cells genome at a preselected site such that the regulatory element activates expression of a nearby gene ultimately resulting in production of the protein encoded by that gene this approach has been suggested in us pat no  and in foreign patent applications wo  wo  and wo  summary of the invention  described herein are new methods for producing tpo dnase i and βinterferon through the generation of novel transcription units within a cells genome methods which differ dramatically from those in the art and represent a major advance in the ability to manipulate expression in mammalian cells the methods are based on the fact that an exogenous regulatory sequence an exogenous exon either coding or noncoding and a splicedonor site can be introduced into a preselected site in the genome by homologous recombination the resulting cells are referred to as targeted or homologously recombinant cells the introduced dna is positioned such that transcripts under the control of the exogenous regulatory region include both the exogenous exon and endogenous exons present in either the tpo dnase i or βinterferon genes resulting in transcripts in which the exogenous and endogenous exons are operatively linked the novel transcription units produced by homologous recombination allow tpo dnase i or βinterferon to be produced in human cells using the naturallyoccurring endogenous exons encoding these proteins without introducing any portion of the coding sequences of the cognate genes the present invention further relates to improved materials and methods for both the in vitro production of tpo βinterferon and dnase i and for the production and delivery of tpo βinterferon and dnase i by gene therapy  the methods of the present invention teach the production of tpo βinterferon or dnase i by gene activation in which the coding dna sequence of the corresponding protein is not introduced into a cell by transfection of exogenous dna encoding the protein instead noncoding sequences upstream of one of these genes or coding or noncoding sequences within the genes are manipulated by gene targeting to create a novel transcription unit which expresses tpo βinterferon or dnase i it is a purpose of this invention to define sequences upstream of the tpo βinterferon or dnase i genes noncoding sequences introns and ′ nontranslated sequences within the human tpo βinterferon or dnase i genes and methods for utilizing these sequences for the production of tpo βinterferon or dnase i  the methods described herein teach production of tpo βinterferon or dnase i proteins by the generation of novel genes in which exogenous and endogenous exons are operatively linked as a result of introduction of exogenous components into the chromosomal dna of a cell the expression of the protein encoded by the endogenous gene is activated other forms of altered gene expression may be envisioned such as increasing expression of a gene which is expressed in the cell as obtained changing the pattern of regulation or induction such that it is different than occurs in the cell as obtained and reducing including eliminating expression of a gene which is expressed in the cell as obtained for example it may be desirable to perform in vitro protein production or gene therapy to produce a protein other than tpo dnase i or βinterferon using a cell type that naturally produces one of these proteins in these settings it would be desirable to eliminate expression of tpo dnase i or βinterferon  the present invention further relates to dna constructs useful in the method of activation of the tpo βinterferon or dnase i genes the dna constructs comprise a targeting sequences b a regulatory sequence c an exon and d an unpaired splicedonor site the targeting sequence in the dna construct is derived from chromosomal dna lying within andor upstream of the desired gene and directs the integration of elements ad into the chromosomal dna in a cell such that the elements bd are operatively linked to sequences of the desired endogenous gene in another embodiment the dna constructs comprise a a targeting sequence b a regulatory sequence c an exon d a splicedonor site e an intron and f a spliceacceptor site wherein the targeting sequence in the dna construct is derived from chromosomal dna lying within andor upstream of the desired gene and directs the integration of elements af such that the elements of bf are operatively linked to the desired endogenous gene the targeting sequence is homologous to the preselected site within or upstream of the tpo βinterferon or dnase i genes in the cellular chromosomal dna with which homologous recombination is to occur in the construct the exon is generally ′ of the regulatory sequence and the splicedonor site is ′ of the exon constructs of this type are disclosed in pending us patent applications us ser no  and us ser no  all of which are incorporated herein by reference  the following serves to illustrate two embodiments of the present invention in which the sequences upstream of the tpo gene are altered to allow expression of tpo in primary secondary or immortalized cells which do not express tpo in detectable quantities in their untransfected state as obtained in embodiment  fig  the targeting construct contains two targeting sequences both the first and second targeting sequences are homologous to sequences upstream of the tpo coding region with the first targeting sequence ′ of the second targeting sequence the targeting construct also contains a regulatory region an exon which in this case comprises noncoding sequences and begins at a cap site and an unpaired splicedonor site the homologous recombination event that generates the novel transcription unit producing tpo is shown in fig   in embodiment  fig  the targeting construct also contains two targeting sequences the first targeting sequence is homologous to sequences upstream of the endogenous tpo coding region and the second targeting sequence is homologous to the second intron of the tpo gene the targeting construct also contains a regulatory region an exon in this case a coding exon derived from the human growth hormone hgh gene and an unpaired splicedonor site the homologous recombination event that generates the novel transcription unit producing tpo is shown in fig   in these two embodiments the products of the targeting events are novel transcription units which generate a mature mrna in which an exogenous exon is positioned upstream of exon  embodiment  or exon  embodiment  of the endogenous tpo gene the product of transcription splicing translation and posttranslational cleavage of the signal peptide is mature tpo embodiments  and  differ with respect to the relative positions of the regulatory sequences of the targeting construct that are inserted and the specific pattern of splicing that needs to occur to produce the final processed transcript  the invention further relates to a method of producing tpo βinterferon or dnase i in vitro or in vivo through introduction of a construct as described above into host cell chromosomal dna by homologous recombination to produce a homologously recombinant cell the homologously recombinant cell is then maintained under conditions which will permit transcription translation and secretion of tpo βinterferon or dnase i  the present invention also relates to cells such as homologously recombinant primary or secondary cells ie nonimmortalized cells and homologously recombinant immortalized cells useful for producing tpo βinterferon or dnase i methods of making such cells methods of using the cells for in vitro protein production and methods of gene therapy homologously recombinant cells of the present invention are of vertebrate origin particularly of mammalian origin and even more particularly of human origin homologously recombinant cells produced by the method of the present invention contain exogenous dna which causes the homologously recombinant cells to express a desired gene at a higher level or with a pattern of regulation or induction that is different than occurs in the corresponding cell that has not undergone homologous recombination  in one embodiment the activated tpo βinterferon or dnase i gene can be further amplified by the inclusion of an amplifiable selectable marker gene which has the property that cells containing amplified copies of the selectable marker gene can be selected for by culturing the cells in the presence of the appropriate selectable agent the activated gene is amplified in tandem with the amplifiable selectable marker gene cells containing many copies of the activated gene are useful for in vitro protein production and gene therapy  homologously recombinant cells of the present invention are useful in a number of applications in humans and animals in one embodiment the cells can be implanted into a human or an animal for protein delivery in the human or animal for example tpo dnase i or βinterferon can be delivered systemically or locally in humans for therapeutic benefit in the treatment of disease tpo for thrombocytopenia dnase i for cf or βinterferon for the treatment of ms in addition homologously recombinant nonhuman cells producing tpo dnase i or βinterferon of nonhuman origin may be produced and human or nonhuman cells expressing tpo dnase i or βinterferon may be enclosed within barrier devices and implanted into humans or animals for use in a therapybrief description of the drawings  fig  is

targeting construct are markeddetailed description of the invention  the present invention as set forth above relates to a method of expressing tpo dnase i or βinterferon in human cells by activation of the endogenous tpo dnase i or βinterferon genes in the present invention homologous recombination is used to insert a regulatory region an exon and a splicedonor site upstream of endogenous exons coding for tpo dnase i or βinterferon generating novel transcription units which are active in the homologously recombinant cell produced the present invention further relates to homologously recombinant cells produced by the present method and to uses of the homologously recombinant cells in a related embodiment an activated tpo dnase i or βinterferon gene is amplified subsequent to activation thus allowing enhanced expression of the activated gene  the invention is based upon the discovery that the regulation or activity of endogenous genes of interest in a cell can be altered by creating a novel gene in which the transcription product of the gene combines exogenous and endogenous exons and is under the control of an exogenous promoter the method is practiced by inserting into a cells genome at a preselected site through homologous recombination dna constructs comprising a one or more targeting sequences b a regulatory sequence c an exon and d an unpaired splicedonor site wherein the targeting sequence or sequences are derived from chromosomal dna within andor upstream of a desired endogenous gene and directs the integration of elements ad such that the elements bd are operatively linked to the endogenous gene in another embodiment the dna constructs comprise a one or more targeting sequences b a regulatory sequence c an exon d a splicedonor site e an intron and f a spliceacceptor site wherein the targeting sequence or sequences are derived from chromosomal dna within andor upstream of a desired endogenous gene and directs the integration of elements af such that the elements of bf are operatively linked to the first exon of the endogenous gene  the present invention relates particularly to novel dna sequences that can be used in the construction of targeting constructs noncoding genomic dna sequences within and upstream of the transcribed regions of the tpo and dnase i genes and upstream of the transcribed region of the βinterferon gene were cloned and are described for the first time these sequences or dna fragments comprising these sequences may be used as targeting sequences in dna constructs useful for gene activation by homologous recombination typically a targeting sequence is at least about  base pairs in length the size of the sequence is chosen to be a size which selectively promotes homologous recombination with desired genomic dna sequences  analysis of the genomic dna sequences and comparison to the known cdna sequences revealed features essential for the construction of targeting constructs for example for the first time it is shown that the first exon of the human tpo gene is entirely noncoding and that translation initiates within the second exon of the endogenous gene this information was important to the design of the gene activation constructs described herein in which splicing of an exogenous exon to the endogenous second exon requires that the exogenous exon be noncoding or in which splicing of an exogenous coding exon requires that targeting be performed such that the exogenous coding exon is inserted in a position so that it can be spliced to the endogenous third exon of the tpo gene furthermore the cloning of approximately  kb of dna sequence from upstream of the human tpo gene provided targeting sequences useful for the development of gene activation constructs fig  shows approximately  kb of novel dna sequence from the human tpo locus lying ′ of the known cdna sequence de sauvage f j et al op cit fig  shows approximately  kb of dna sequence from the human tpo locus

sequences of figs  and  or fragments derived from these sequences are useful for homologous recombination as taught herein  similarly for the first time it is shown that the first exon of the human dnase i gene is entirely noncoding this information was important to the design of the targeting constructs described herein example  for example describes a targeting construct which includes two noncoding exons separated by an intron and which is inserted upstream of dnase i exon  this configuration allows promoter position to be optimized by varying the length of either the exogenous intron or the intron present between the exogenous exon and the endogenous second exon of the dnase i gene while ensuring that the primary transcript will be spliced appropriately and that translation initiates at the correct position for synthesis of functional dnase i furthermore the cloning of approximately  kb of dna sequence from upstream of the human dnase i gene provided targeting sequences useful for the development of gene activation constructs fig  shows approximately  kb of novel dna sequence from the human dnase i locus lying ′ of the known cdna sequence shak s et al op cit fig

constructs comprising the novel sequences of figs  and  or fragments derived from these sequences are useful for homologous recombination as described herein  finally the analysis of the upstream region of the βinterferon gene a gene which is known to lack introns was cloned and sequenced and a detailed restriction map was produced previously only  bp of dna upstream of the translation initiation codon was characterized see genbank entry humifnbf the cloning and sequence analysis provided approximately  kb of genomic dna upstream of the gene for the design and construction of a targeting construct example  fig  shows approximately  kb of novel dna sequence from the βinterferon locus lying ′ of the known sequences genbank entry humifnbf dna constructs comprising the novel

as a group the exons introns and splicesites are referred to as the “structural elements” of the construct socalled because they are important in defining the structure of the novel gene produced by homologous recombination between genomic dna and dna of the targeting construct as described herein there frequently are additional construct components such as a selectable andor amplifiable markers  the dna in the construct is referred to as exogenous dna defined herein as dna which is introduced into a cell by the methods described herein such as with the dna constructs of the present invention exogenous dna can contain sequences identical to or different from the endogenous dna the term endogenous dna is defined herein as dna present in the cell as obtained  the dna of the construct can be obtained from sources in which it occurs in nature or can be produced using genetic engineering techniques or synthetic processes   the targeting sequence  the targeting sequence or sequences are dna sequences which permit homologous recombination into the genome of the selected cell containing the gene of interest targeting sequences are generally dna sequences which are homologous to ie identical or sufficiently similar to dna sequences present in the genome of the cells as obtained eg coding or noncoding dna located upstream of the transcriptional start site within the transcribed region encompassing the gene or downstream of the transcriptional stop site of the gene or sequences present in the genome through a previous modification such that the targeting sequence and cellular dna can undergo homologous recombination in general two sequences are described as homologous if a dna strand of one sequence is capable of hybridizing to a dna strand of the other sequence under conditions standardly used for the detection of sequence similarity see for example ausubel et al current protocols in molecular biology wiley new york ny  the targeting sequence or sequences used are selected with reference to the site into which the dna in the dna construct is to be inserted and may be derived from either genomic or cdna sequences typically a targeting sequence is at least about  base pairs in length the size of the sequence is chosen to be a size which selectively promotes homologous recombination with desired genomic dna sequences  one or more targeting sequences can be employed for example a circular plasmid or dna fragment preferably employs a single targeting sequence a linear plasmid or dna fragment preferably employs two targeting sequences with exogenous dna to be inserted into genome positioned between the two targeting sequences the targeting sequence or sequences can be within an endogenous gene eg within the sequences of an exon andor intron within the endogenous promoter sequences or upstream of the endogenous promoter sequences the targeting sequence or sequences can include those regions of a gene presently known or sequenced andor regions further upstream which are structurally uncharacterized but can be mapped using restriction enzymes and cloning approaches available to one skilled in the art   the regulatory sequence  the regulatory sequence of the dna construct can be comprised of one or more of a variety of elements including promoters such as a constitutive or inducible promoters enhancers scaffoldattachment regions or matrix

sequence which is copied into rna and is present in a mature mrna molecule an intron is defined as a sequence of one or more nucleotides lying between two exons and which is removed by splicing from a precursor rna molecule in the formation of an mrna molecule  the dna constructs of the present invention contain one or more exons the exons can optionally contain dna which encodes one or more amino acids andor partially encodes an amino acid ie one or two bases of a codon where the exogenous exon or exons encode one or more amino acids andor a portion of an amino acid the dna construct is designed such that upon transcription and splicing the reading frame is inframe with the second or subsequent exon of the endogenous genes coding region as used herein inframe means that the encoding sequences of for example a first exon and a second exon when fused join together nucleotides in a manner that does not change the appropriate reading frame of the portion of the mrna derived from the second exon  in the case of activating the tpo and dnase i genes the exogenous exon can preferably be derived from any gene in which the exon includes a cap site and noncoding sequences examples would include the first exon of the cmv immediateearly gene and follicle stimulating hormone fsh gene in the case of βinterferon whose gene contains no natural introns there are preferably two exogenous noncoding exons separated by an intron in the targeting construct  b splicesites  introns contained within the mrna of eukaryotic cells are removed through the recognition of signals termed splicedonor and spliceacceptor sites a splicedonor site is a sequence which directs the splicing of one exon to another exon typically the first exon lies ′ of the second exon and the splicedonor site overlapping and flanking the first exon on its ′ side recognizes a spliceacceptor site flanking the second exon on the ′ side of the second exon splicedonor sites have a characteristic consensus sequence represented as acagguragu where r denotes a purine nucleotide with the gu in the fourth and fifth positions being required jackson i j nucleic acids research    the first three bases of the splicedonor consensus site are the last three bases of the exon splicedonor sites are functionally defined by their ability to effect the appropriate reaction within the mrna splicing pathway  an unpaired splicedonor site is defined herein as a splicedonor site which is present in a targeting construct and is not accompanied in the targeting construct by a spliceacceptor site positioned ′ to the unpaired splicedonor site upon homologous recombination between the targeting sequences and genomic dna the unpaired splicedonor site results in splicing to an endogenous spliceacceptor site  a spliceacceptor site is a sequence which like a splicedonor site directs the splicing of one exon to another exon acting in conjunction with a splicedonor site the splicing apparatus uses a spliceacceptor site to effect the removal of an intron spliceacceptor sites have a characteristic sequence represented as yyyyyyyyyynyag where y denotes any pyrimidine and n denotes any nucleotide jackson i j nucleic acids research    c marker genes for selection and amplification  the identification of the targeting event can be facilitated by the use of one or more selectable marker genes

regulatory sequence within an endogenous gene eg within the sequences of an exon andor intron within the endogenous promoter sequences or upstream of the endogenous promoter sequences with said genes corresponding to the endogenous cellular tpo βinterferon or dnase i gene alternatively or additionally the targeting constructs may be designed to include sequences which affect the structure or stability of the tpo βinterferon or dnase i protein or corresponding rna molecule for example rna stability elements splice sites andor leader sequences of rna molecules can be modified to improve or alter the function stability andor translatability of an rna molecule protein sequences may also be altered such as signal sequences active sites andor structural sequences for enhancing or modifying glycosylation transport secretion or functional properties of a protein according to this method introduction of the exogenous dna results in the alteration of the structural or functional properties of the expressed proteins or rna molecules  in one embodiment the method can be used to create novel transcription units encoding fusion proteins in which structural enzymatic or ligand or receptor binding protein domains of another protein are fused to tpo dnase i or βinterferon in these cases the exogenous coding dna contains an atg translation initiation codon inframe with the coding sequences of the endogenous tpo dnase i or βinterferon gene for example the exogenous dna can encode a sequence which can anchor tpo or dnase i to a membrane a portion of a signal peptide designed to improve cellular secretion leader sequences enzymatic regions transmembrane domain regions cofactor binding regions or other functional regions  the dna construct can also include a bacterial origin of replication and bacterial antibiotic resistance markers or other selectable markers which allow for largescale plasmid propagation in bacteria or any other suitable cloninghost system  b transfection and homologous recombination  according to the present method the construct is introduced into the cell such as a primary secondary or immortalized cell as a single dna construct or as separate dna sequences which become incorporated into the chromosomal or nuclear dna of a transfected cell  the targeting dna construct can be introduced into cells on a single dna construct or on separate constructs the total length of the dna construct will vary according to the number of components and the length of each and the construct will generally be at least about  nucleotides further the dna can be introduced as linear doublestranded with or without singlestranded regions at one or both ends singlestranded or circular dna  any of the construct types of the disclosed invention is then introduced into the cell to obtain a transfected cell the transfected cell is maintained under conditions which permit homologous recombination as is known in the art reviewed in capecchi m r science   when the homologously recombinant cell is maintained under conditions sufficient for transcription of the dna the regulatory region introduced by the targeting construct as in the case of a promoter will activate expression of the novel transcription unit produced by homologous recombination  the dna constructs may be introduced into cells by a variety of physical or chemical methods including electroporation microinjection microprojectile bombardment calcium phosphate precipitation and liposome polybrene or deae dextranmediated transfection  c the targeted gene and resulting product  the targeting dna construct when introduced by homologous recombination or targeting into cells containing the tpo βinterferon or dnase i gene produces a novel transcription unit which results in the expression of tpo βinterferon or dnase i  at the targeted site in the genome the exogenous regulatory sequence is operatively linked to a cap site which initiates transcription operatively linked is defined as a configuration in which the exogenous regulatory sequence exon splicedonor site and optionally an intron sequence and spliceacceptor site are appropriately targeted at a position relative to the endogenous gene such that the regulatory element directs the production of a primary rna transcript which initiates at a cap site and includes sequences corresponding to the exogenous exon or exons and endogenous exons the tpo dnase i or βinterferon gene in an operatively linked configuration the splicedonor site of the targeting construct directs a splicing event between an exogenous exon and the spliceacceptor site of an endogenous exon such that a desired protein can be produced from the fully spliced mature transcript in one embodiment the spliceacceptor site is endogenous such that the splicing event is directed to an endogenous exon of the tpo or dnase i gene in another embodiment an intron and a spliceacceptor site are included in the targeting construct used to activate the βinterferon gene and a splicing event removes the intron introduced by the targeting construct  d the homologously recombinant cells  the targeting event results in the insertion of the regulatory and structural sequences of the targeting construct into a cells genome creating a novel transcriptional unit under the control of the exogenous regulatory sequences  homologous recombination between the genomic dna and the introduced dna results in a homologously recombinant cell which may be a primary secondary or immortalized human or other mammalian cell in which sequences which alter the expression of an endogenous gene are operatively linked to the endogenous tpo dnase i or βinterferon gene particularly the invention includes a homologously recombinant cell comprising exogenous regulatory sequences and an exon flanked by a splicedonor site which are introduced at a predetermined site by a targeting dna construct and are operatively linked to the coding region of the endogenous gene optionally there may be multiple exogenous exons coding or noncoding and introns operatively linked to any exon of the endogenous gene the resulting homologously recombinant cells are cultured under conditions which select for amplification if appropriate of the dna encoding the amplifiable marker and the novel transcriptional unit with or without amplification cells produced by this method can be cultured under conditions as are known in the art suitable for the expression of tpo βinterferon or dnase i  the targeting constructs and methods of

nonhuman animal by conventional pharmaceutical routes as is known in the art eg oral intravenous intramuscular intranasal intratracheal or subcutaneous as described herein the homologously recombinant cells can be immortalized primary or secondary human cells the use of cells from other species may be desirable in cases where the nonhuman cells are advantageous for protein production purposes where the nonhuman tpo dnase i or βinterferon produced is useful therapeutically  g advantages  the methodologies dna constructs cells and resulting proteins of the invention herein possess versatility and many other advantages over processes currently employed within the art in gene targeting the ability to activate expression of an endogenous tpo βinterferon or dnase i gene by positioning an exogenous regulatory sequence and other structural sequences at various positions ranging from directly fused to portions of the normal genes coding region to  kilobase pairs or further upstream of the transcribed region of an endogenous gene or within an intron of an endogenous gene is advantageous for gene expression in cells for example it can be employed to position the regulatory element upstream or downstream of regions that normally silence or negatively regulate a gene the positioning of a regulatory element upstream or downstream of such a region can override such dominant negative effects that normally inhibit transcription in addition regions of dna that normally inhibit transcription or have an otherwise detrimental effect on the expression of a gene may be deleted using the targeting constructs described herein the present invention also allows proteins to be expressed in the context of their normal intron sequences which have been shown to be important factors in the expression of genes in mammalian cells cf korb m et al nucl acids res     additionally since promoter function is known to depend strongly on the local environment a wide range of positions may be explored in order to find those local environments optimal for function however since atg start codons are found frequently within mammalian dna approximately one occurrence per  base pairs as calculated from nearestneighbor dinucleotide frequencies in human dna transcription cannot simply initiate at any position upstream of a gene and produce a transcript containing a long leader sequence preceding the correct atg start codon since the frequent occurrence of atg codons in such a leader sequence will prevent translation of the correct gene product and render the message useless thus the incorporation of an exogenous exon a splicedonor site and optionally an intron and a spliceacceptor site into targeting constructs comprising a regulatory region allows gene expression to be optimized by identifying the optimal site for regulatory region function without the limitation imposed by needing to avoid inappropriate atg start codons in the mrna produced this provides significantly increased flexibility in the placement of the construct and makes it possible to activate a wider range of genes than is possible using other technologies for example us pat no  and foreign patent applications wo  wo  and wo  describe homologous recombination methods for inserting a regulatory sequence upstream of the coding region of an endogenous gene in these methods only a very small number of positions for promoter insertion are acceptable for expression limited by the frequent occurrence of atg start codons as described above  the present invention provides further advantages over the methods available in the art for example the use of homologous recombination results in the production of cells in which the novel transcription unit is present in the same location in all cells in which homologous recombination has occurred thus the novel transcription unit will function similarly in all homologously recombinant cells derived independently this allows for the production of cells with highly predictable properties in the case of in vitro protein production it is desirable to develop cells in which the behavior eg the expression and amplification properties of the desired gene can be controlled and there is little variation when comparing individual cells which are being processed for largescale production purposes in the case of in vivo protein production or gene therapy it is desirable to be able to develop cells in which the properties are predictable and uniform among individual patients this allows for a high degree of precision in achieving appropriate levels of the desired protein in vivo leading to controlled and reproducible methods for treating disease  the dna constructs described above are useful for operatively linking exogenous regulatory and structural elements to endogenous coding sequences in a way that precisely creates a novel transcriptional unit provides flexibility in the relative positioning of exogenous regulatory elements and endogenous genes and ultimately enables a highly controlled system for and regulating expression of genes of therapeutic interest  the subject invention will now be illustrated by the following examples which are not intended to be limiting in any way examples example  cloning of the tpo gene and identification of ′ flanking sequences  the human thrombopoietin gene was isolated from a human

polypeptide exons  and  are separated by intron   bp and exons  and  are separated by intron   bp there are two differences between the sequence reported in fig  and the sequence published by de sauvage et al nucleotides at positions − and − are reported as c residues by de sauvage et al and are shown as t residues in fig  these residues are outside of the coding sequence for tpo and may be explained by sequence polymorphism or by errors in compilation of the published sequence in any event this minor difference does not impact the ability of the person of skill to practice the invention as described herein example  construction of targeting plasmids for activation and amplification of the tpo gene  the activation of the tpo gene can be accomplished by a number of strategies as shown in figs  in the strategy shown in fig  a targeting fragment is introduced into the genome of recipient cells for insertion of a regulatory region a noncoding exon and a functional unpaired splicedonor site upstream of the tpo coding region specifically the targeting construct from which this fragment is derived prtpo is designed to include a first targeting sequence homologous to sequences upstream of the tpo gene an amplifiable marker gene a selectable marker gene a regulatory region a cap size a noncoding exon an unpaired splicedonor site and a second targeting sequence corresponding to sequences downstream of the first targeting sequence but upstream of tpo exon  by this strategy homologously recombinant cells produce an mrna precursor which includes the noncoding exon introduced upstream of the tpo gene by homologous recombination the second targeting sequence and any sequences between the second targeting sequence and exon  of the tpo gene and the remaining exons introns and ′ untranslated regions of the tpo gene fig  splicing of this message results in the fusion of the exogenous noncoding exon to exon  of the endogenous tpo gene which when translated will produce tpo in this strategy the first and second targeting sequences are upstream of the normal target gene but this is not required see below the size of the intron in the targeting construct and thus the position of the regulatory region relative to the coding region of the gene may be varied to optimize the function of the regulatory region  plasmid prtpo is constructed as follows based on the restriction map
