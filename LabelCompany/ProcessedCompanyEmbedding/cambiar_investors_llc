standard deviation    three year       commentary market review  us equities as defined by the sp  index posted their seventh consecutive quarter of positive returns gaining  in the second quarter  we believe the path of least resistance remains to the upside for equities although red flags in the form of elevated valuations tightening monetary policy and investor complacency bear watching  at one point during the quarter market volatility vix levels reached a closing low mark not seen since the th quarter of  source chicago board options exchange  although market naysayers will point to investor complacency as a precursor to a market decline we see no historical data to substantiate this claim  that said the massive shift to passive investments results in a uniquely different market structure vs previous cycles a relevant consideration is how stock prices will react should the market become more stressed while equities may now be in the later innings of the recovery that began in  corporate earnings remain healthy in the aggregate inflation levels are benign and international markets have also begun to participate to the upside  as discussed in previous commentaries cambiar believes that stock selection will take on more importance as we get into the later stages of the businessmarket cycle growth vs value one of the more notable performance trends in the equity markets this year to date has been the wide performance gap between growth and value stocks  this divergence in returns began in the first quarter and continued to widen in the second quarter before closing a bit in june  as the below graphs illustrate earnings estimates have been raised across sp  participants in the aggregate which typically coincides with multiple expansion  yet value stocks as defined by the sp  value have experienced multiple compression for much of the year while growth stocks have seen their multiples rerate to the upside fundamentals vs multiple expansion    source bloomberg  for illustrative purposes only the outperformance of growth stocks coincides with a flatteningdecline in bond yields implying increased market skepticism towards economic growth and thus we feel favoring companies who possess higher organic growth rates  not surprisingly the surge in growth stocks has been most prominent in the technology sector – examples include amazon apple and facebook  while each of these companies deserve premium valuations given high market shares and defacto monopoly business profiles the increases in market capitalizations begin to question whether the embedded market expectations are realisticachievable needless to say the market environment thus far in  has been less friendly for value practitioners  cambiar’s response has been to remain focused on the fundamentals and to not lose sight of the objective in what has been an obviously potent – and potentially overdone – growth flip  styledriven markets tend to selfcancel over longer timeframes but can influence performance over shorter periods  cambiar’s relatively low allocation to growthoriented segments of the market as well as being a bit too ‘valuey’ has been a headwind vs benchmarks over the first two quarters of the year yet given the low valuationlow expectation intersection in which many of our companies reside even a modest change in market sentiment could provide a boost to the cambiar portfolios small cap fund the cambiar small cap fund was unable to keep pace with the strategy’s assigned benchmarks in the quarter – an admittedly frustrating performance in an environment that was relatively conducive to active management  cambiar’s underperformance vs the russell  index is more understandable given this benchmarks higher allocation to growth stocks which have outperformed value by a wide margin in   cambiar remains disciplined in identifying companies that meet our purchase criteria which has admittedly been more difficult in a relatively expensive small cap market  price discovery has been more evident in  and correlations across sectors have declined – both of these factors provide an improved backdrop for active managers to add value  although the healthier environment has yet to translate into outperformance for the strategy cambiar remains confident that the portfolio can rebound in the back half of the year at a sector level technology continued to be a challenging space for the portfolio as cambiar’s tech holdings had the largest negative impact in q  a reasonable criticism is that the portfolio seems to be out of sync with the market notably in the technology sector  where a value mindset in the face of significant technological disruption can be asymmetric to the downside  perhaps the fund has been too “valuey” that said we believe the tech companies we own maintain strong marketshare generate consistent cashflow and remain relevant in their respective endmarkets  atm processor cardtronics is a q case in point regarding cambiar’s struggles in the tech sector  the stock declined after lowering earnings for   cambiar anticipated  to be a transition year as the company worked to integrate a number of restructuring initiatives  however shortterm execution issues as well as slowing same store sales growth were the primary cause of the earnings shortfall in q  cambiar continues to believe these issues to be transitory and are confident in the ability of management to execute their business plan  energy stocks took another leg down in the quarter as oil prices continued to slide before recovering a bit at the end of june  while only averaging  of the portfolio cambiar’s energy positions have been a detractor to performance  although the market is focused on the number of oil rigs coming online an overlooked data point is oil production within shale – which has started to flatten  assuming that demand remains robust cambiar believes that oil prices are poised to move higher in the second half of the year which should trigger a rerating in the portfolio’s holdings in the sector   the consumer staples sector is traditionally viewed to be the lower beta segment of the portfolio given the companies’ relatively stable demand trends  yet the sector was anything but stable in the quarter as amazon’s purchase of whole foods triggered a selloff on fears of reduced pricing power and lower margins stemming from the deal  the fund was hampered by both an overweight allocation to the sector as well as belowbenchmark stock performance  united natural foods and dean foods were two underperforming positions in the quarter  in our view the market’s negative response in both cases is a ‘shoot first’ response as there is nothing imminent that derails their respective investment cases  both companies we feel offer attractive free cashflow yields and possess attractive upside  bright spots in the quarter included positive stock selection in healthcare and financials  healthcare was a notable underperformer in the first quarter the subsequent outperformance in q illustrates the need for patience and not overreacting to shorterterm stock moves  individual outperformers included bruker corporation and molina healthcare  molina’s rerating in the quarter was due to the departure of the firm’s founders after a period of disappointing financial performance  many believe cambiar included that a new executive team can drive margin expansion and earnings growth for molina  although cambiar took advantage of the recovery in the stock to trim the holding back to policy weight we believe the longterm outlook remains positive trading activity within the portfolio was fairly light in q which points to cambiar’s continued conviction in the strategy’s aggregate exposures – despite the slow start to   the valuation support remains intact for a number of the portfolio’s current underperformers – we acknowledge the value trap tone of this comment but do not believe that to be the case  although encouraged to see some of our detractors from the first quarter become strong contributors more recently the portfolio has yet to put it all together although moving further in the rearview mirror the past success of the small cap fund as well as solid performance in cambiar’s other domestic offerings gives us confidence in the ability to demonstrate a greater degree of efficacy in the portfolio  that said we are aware that performance is the final proof statement and that stronger results are imperative to restore confidence in the strategy  as mean reversion is an underlying tenet to the cambiar discipline the fund is certainly overdue to experience some mean reversion vs the benchmarks looking ahead us equities moved higher in the first half of  as corporates delivered on the earnings front and there were no notable disruptions ie ‘risk off’ moves as has been the case in previous years  to this point equities have not been susceptible to tightening monetary policy as the two interest rate hikes by the federal reserve barely made a ripple in the market  the heavy skew of asset flows into passively managed instruments is likely a contributing factor to the low volatility that has permeated the equity markets – vs history as well as relative to fixed income source bloomberg while cambiar maintains a fairly constructive outlook for equities we anticipate that the glidepath may get a bit bumpier in the second half of   statistically speaking – can we get much lower as it relates to market volatility  additional moves by the fed in the way of rate hikesbalance sheet reduction actions at a time when inflation is lower than expected may also start to impact the markets via tightening liquidity  as discussed in our q commentary the direction of stock prices should be positively correlated to earnings as there is not much room left for multiple expansion  on this front earnings have been solid and businesses could get an additional lift in the second half of the year should some of the trump administration’s progrowth policies come to pass       regardless of the environment the cambiar formula for seeking to outperform the market has not changed invest in quality businesses whose current valuation is not indicative of their normalized earnings power identify inflection points that can drive mean reversion

europe index returned  in q doubling up on the  return for the sp  index  europe has been a few years behind the us in its recovery from the global financial crisis yet economic data coming out of the eurozone has been encouraging – providing a healthy backdrop for earnings gains  monetary policy in europe remains generally accommodative although the european central bank ecb has begun discussing steps in removing the stimulus punch bowl  emerging markets as measured by the msci emerging markets index also posted positive gains for the quarter and remain one of the topperforming asset classes on a yeartodate basis growth vs value one of the more notable performance trends in the equity markets this year has been the wide performance gap between growth and value stocks  this divergence in returns began in the first quarter and continued to widen in the second quarter before closing a bit in june  as the below graphs illustrate earnings estimates have been raised across international equities in the aggregate which typically coincides with multiple expansion  yet value stocks as defined by the msci eafe value index have experienced multiple compression while growth stocks have seen their multiples rerate to the upside fundamentals vs multiple expansion    source bloomberg for illustrative purposes only the outperformance of growth stocks coincides with a flatteningdecline in bond yields implying increased market skepticism towards economic growth and thus we feel favoring companies who possess higher organic growth rates  not surprisingly the surge in growth stocks has been most prominent in the technology sector – examples include amazon apple alibaba and tencent  while each of these companies deserve premium valuations given high market shares and defacto monopoly business profiles their respective increases in market capitalizations begin to question whether the embedded market expectations are realisticachievable needless to say the market environment thus far in  has been less friendly for value practitioners  cambiar’s response has been to remain focused on the fundamentals and to not lose sight of the objective in what has been a potent – and potentially overdone – growth flip  styledriven markets tend to selfcancel over longer timeframes but can influence performance over shorter periods  cambiar’s relatively low allocation to growthoriented segments of the market as well as being a bit too ‘valuey’ had been a headwind vs benchmarks over the first two quarters of the year yet given the low valuationlow expectation intersection in which many of our companies reside even a modest change in market sentiment could provide a boost to the cambiar portfolios global equity fund                                                                                                                               although positive in absolute terms the cambiar global equity fund trailed the strategy’s assigned benchmarks for the second quarter  the performance shortfall in the quarter is primarily attributed to security selection as the portfolio’s overweight allocation to europe had a positive effect on performance  implementing a value discipline in a market that clearly favors growth has been a headwind that said an impartial assessment also points to the need for better performance from the positions we own  stock selection has historically been an attribute at cambiar and while disappointed that the global portfolio has not participated to a greater extent thus far in  we remain constructive on the outlook for our companies      portfolio buysell activity in the quarter was in line with previous time periods  a rare intraquarter round trip involved the purchase and subsequent sale of royal ahold delhaize ahold owns a number of supermarket brands in europe and the us  within weeks after initiating the position amazon’s purchase of whole foods jeopardized the investment case for ahold – which was predicated on increasing free cashflow and margin improvement  in light of the change in the competitive landscape particularly when it involves a competitor with particularly deep pockets and a willingness to manage the business at a loss cambiar took a modest loss in the position and moved on to fight another day energy stocks remained in reverse during the second quarter the global portfolio was negatively impacted by an overweight allocation in the sector as well as belowbenchmark returns during the quarter  despite positive steps taken by companies in the form of restructuring improvement of balance sheets and an increased focus on free cashflow stock prices remain highly correlated to underlying commodity prices which have been on a downward trajectory since the start of the year  the market remains fixated on the weekly energy information administration eia inventory reports with draws positive for the sector and inventory builds sparking a selloff  while acknowledging that the rebalance of oil supply and demand has taken longer than expected cambiar does anticipate that oil prices will firm in the second half of the year  given the overwhelmingly negative sentiment enveloping the sector it would not take much in the way of good news for energy stocks to begin performing more favorably the healthcare sector has been one of the topperforming sectors in the market thus far in  –likely a function of more positive investor sentiment improving fundamentals and reduced threat of pricing reform  cambiar has maintained an overweight position in healthcare during the year however this valueadd has been offset by mixed stock performance  during the quarter solid gains from smith  nephew and agilent were negated by soft returns from universal health services astellas pharmaceuticals and biogen  cambiar remains constructive on the intermediateterm prospects for the portfolio’s healthcare holdings confident that the underlying value in our companies should be reflected in their stock prices one sector where cambiar exhibited positive stock selection in the quarter was financials as a number of the portfolio’s international bank and insurance positions rebounded in response to solid earnings gains and investor optimism regarding economic growth  higher bond yields would be an additional tailwind to participants in the sector  one area of weakness within the sector was the portfolio’s us credit card positions – capital one and synchrony which is a private label issuer of credit cards  synchrony raised their forward credit loss and provisioning estimates which subsequently impacted earnings guidance  cambiar believed the market response to be an overreaction to this wellmanaged company given synchrony’s attractive valuation strong cashflow and consistent topline growth we are continuing to hold the position   looking ahead global equities are firmly in the green as we reach the halfway point of   while popular investment narratives for the first six months of the year have tended to be more thematic in nature ie progrowth bearish energy an improvement in underlying fundamentals across most sectors of the market have resulted in a broadbased rally in stocks  looking ahead the backdrop for equities appears to remain attractive that said cambiar spends equal time considering what could wrong as we do in focusing on the positive attributes of our companies  with more central banks starting to adopt less dovish tones as opposed to outright hawkish the market is understandably nervous about the prospects of reduced monetary stimulus possibly derailing the economic recovery  we think such concerns are a bit premature but certainly worth monitoring could  be the first year since  when international markets finally outperform the us  cambiar has been of the position for the past couple of years that nonus stocks should offer a more attractive riskreturn profile given valuations and the potential for more robust earnings growth  although economic growth rates in europe and japan are unlikely to overtake that of the us it is more about the rate of change vs absolute levels regardless of the environment the cambiar formula for seeking to outperform the market has not changed invest in quality businesses whose current valuation is not indicative of their normalized earnings power identify inflection

market review  us equities as defined by the sp  index posted their seventh consecutive quarter of positive returns gaining  in the second quarter  we believe the path of least resistance remains to the upside for equities although red flags in the form of elevated valuations tightening monetary policy and investor complacency bear watching  at one point during the quarter market volatility vix levels reached a closing low mark not seen since the th quarter of  source chicago board options exchange  although market naysayers will point to investor complacency as a precursor to a market decline we see no historical data to substantiate this claim  that said the massive shift to passive investments results in a uniquely different market structure vs previous cycles a relevant consideration is how stock prices will react should the market become more stressed while equities may now be in the later innings of the recovery that began in  corporate earnings remain healthy in the aggregate inflation levels are benign and international markets have also begun to participate to the upside  as discussed in previous commentaries cambiar believes that stock selection will take

the year yet given the low valuationlow expectation intersection in which many of our companies reside even a modest change in market sentiment could provide a boost to the cambiar portfolios opportunity fund the cambiar opportunity fund was successful in outpacing the russell  value benchmark yet unable to overtake the primary sp  index for the quarter  in a continuation of market conditions from the first quarter growth stocks widened their lead over value – thus making the sp  index a tough bogey to outperform over the first six months of   despite the increasingly loud calls for the end of active management it is worth noting that the opportunity fund has outperformed the rv index by a fairly wide margin over the past one year with longerterm results also more than holding their own  we anticipate that the current environment remains favorable for active management  given the variance in returns across economic sectors    buysell activity in the quarter was relatively low with three new purchases and two liquidations  the fund remained diversified across most sectors of the market financials and technology continued to have the largest representations in the portfolio  underweight allocations include consumer discretionary utilities and telecom  cambiar’s nonparticipation in telecom has been a valueadd thus far in  as the sector has been a lagging performer  although the stated dividend yields within telecom may appear desirable in the current lowrate environment yields that appear too good to be true may also be a red flag of sorts  given an increasingly aggressive pricing environment high debt loads and flattening subscriber trends telecom stocks may not represent an overly attractive investment opportunity – even with the yield value stocks once again played second fiddle to their growth counterparts as growth extended their yeartodate lead over value  with few exceptions telecom and energy value sectors finished modestly higher although there were more outsized moves at the individual stock level    at a sector level cambiar’s technology positions once again were the top valueadd for the portfolio  shares of oracle were

subsequently a detractor from performance for the quarter  despite positive steps taken by companies in the form of restructuring improvement of balance sheets and an increased focus on free cashflow stock prices remain highly correlated to underlying commodity prices which have been on a downward trajectory since the start of the year  the market is fixated on the weekly energy information administration eia inventory reports with draws positive for the sector and inventory builds sparking a selloff  given the sunk costs many us producers have incurred with their existing wells oil production at current prices provides sufficient cash returns  however it is likely that the rate of growth in new well activity will slow as management teams reevaluate their capex plans in response to the lower price deck  reduced labor supply higher input costs and less friendly capital marketfinancing options might also constrain shale production  while acknowledging that the rebalance of oil supply and demand has taken longer than expected cambiar does anticipate that oil prices will firm in the second half of the year  given the overwhelmingly negative sentiment enveloping the sector it would not take much in the way of good news for energy stocks to begin performing more favorably positive stock selection in the consumer discretionary and staples sectors was somewhat offset by belowbenchmark although positive returns in the healthcare sector  healthcare has been one of the topperforming sectors in the market thus far in  – likely a function of improved sentiment towards the sector improving fundamentals and reduced threat of pricing reform   looking ahead us equities moved higher in the first half of  as corporates delivered on the earnings front and there were no notable disruptions ie ‘risk off’ moves as has been the case in previous years  to this point equities have not been susceptible to tightening monetary policy as the two interest rate hikes by the federal reserve barely made a ripple in the market  the heavy skew of asset flows into passively managed instruments is likely a contributing factor to the low volatility that has permeated the equity markets – vs history as well as relative to fixed income source bloomberg while cambiar maintains a fairly constructive outlook for equities we anticipate that the glidepath may get a bit bumpier in the second half of   statistically speaking – can we get much lower as it relates to market volatility  additional moves by the fed in the way of rate hikesbalance sheet reduction actions at a time when inflation is lower than expected may also start to impact the markets via tightening liquidity  as discussed in our q commentary the direction of stock prices should be positively correlated to earnings as there is not much room left for multiple expansion  on this front earnings have been solid and businesses could get an additional lift in the second half of the year should some of the

office complex in cherry creek north a district within denver co our philosophy cambiar utilizes a fundamental relative value investment discipline our investment approach is best described as the search for quality companies that possess underappreciated catalysts and trade near the low end of their normalized valuation ranges research plays a central role in all of cambiar’s investment decision each of cambiar’s seasoned analysts are assigned coverage of two to three sectorsindustries creating a targetrich environment for them to choose only stocks that meet our investment criteria valuations the market tends to value companies within a range which can be used to establish some degree of context for what a company is worth at a given point in time cambiar’s seasoned analysts follow that range closely and are able to identify when a company is approaching the lower end of their valuation range potentially resulting in an attractive entry point catalyst simply identifying a company valued at the lower end of its historical range is the first step but a potential investment must also stand to benefit from an event that will cause investors to push it towards revaluing higher  employee owned cambiar’s ownership structure is designed to foster individual accountability and a culture of entrepreneurship in which each employee feels responsible for the success of the firm and its clients our independence coupled with being located in denver colorado away from the groupthink and conventional wisdom associated with major financial cities allows us to have a unique
