thermionic devicesteam daniel riley phd and jared schwede phd jared schwede and daniel riley completed their phds in the department of physics at stanford university at stanford they were part of a worldleading research group on thermionic energy converters focusing on a breakthrough solar conversion process based on photonenhanced thermionic energy conversion which harvests both photon and heat energy from the suns spectrum dan and jareds work on thermionics has been recognized with the ross n tucker award which acknowledges excellence in semiconductor and materials research at the berkeley energy and resources collaborative innovation expo and by the global climate and energy project among others they are excited to be leading this effort at cyclotron road to develop transformative thermionics technology technologycritical need today mechanical heat engines tower above all other methods of energy conversion they transport us keep us cool and produce over  of us electricity nonetheless these engines born in th century technology are constrained to applications that can tolerate their size and weight  source jc zhao adapted from catalog of chp technologies us environmental protection agency combined heat and power partnership   technology vision thermionic energy converters can rival the performance of all conventional heat engines in a package that can be scaled from watts to megawatts current stateoftheart thermionic energy converters have a very simple architecture based on two materials separated by a thermally insulating vacuum gap these devices saw substantial development in the s and s but were limited by the technologies of the day  handbuilt research converters from ge research s  key innovation applying modern materials and wafer fabrication techniques spark thermionics will tap the full potential of thermionic conversion and transform how we harvest heat energy  microfabricated converter heated °c at stanford university s  manufacturing challenges waferscale microfabrication of vacuum devices nanoscale surface engineering and hightemperature encapsulation competing technology current practice for directly converting heat to electricity relies on thermoelectric devices which use thermal gradients within solidstate materials to drive electric current however thermoelectrics are limited by parasitic heat losses intrinsic to the solidstate technology itself the fundamental advantage of thermionic conversion lies in the vacuum gap architecture a nearly perfect thermal insulator that allows enormous temperature differences between the hot and cool electrodesfirst market hypothesis thermionics will enable economic combinedheatandpower systems for distributed power and hightemperature industrial processes because they are able to operate efficiently at extremely high temperaturespotential for impact thermionics has the potential to dramatically increase our utilization of waste heat harvesting energy that is inaccessible to conventional heat engines ultimately thermionic energy conversion could even displace conventional engines and redefine the energy industry were looking for technical
