what sort of products can i find keratin in and why is it used  keratin questions answered skip to content skip to menu search the inside scoop on keratin hair care and skin care products home hair care skin care about ask a question you are here home » hair care » what sort of products can i find keratin in and why is it used what sort of products can i find keratin in and why is it used so now you know what keratin is you probably want to know where you can find it and what it can do for your hair right the good news is keratin is found in a range of hair shampoos conditioners treatments for damaged and colored hair but you’ll have to do some careful ‘label checking’ next time you’re shopping the purest type of keratin is the one we discussed in the last blog post – grown right  in the country of the lord of the rings’ ‘middle earth’ – yep little old new zealand from their most common woolly mammals – sheep so wherever you shop whether in the supermarket drug store or at the hairdresser – what you want to look for is products that contain the purest stuff replicine functional keratin technology  this sometimes appears on the label as keratin or oxidized keratin some products sound like they contain keratin they use keratin in their product name to falsely mislead you the consumer but they don’t actually list keratin in their ingredients or may only have hydrolyzed keratin which is so far from being real keratin that it doesn’t do much so why is it used and what are the benefits replicine functional keratin technology contains a purified form of keratin intermediate filament protein manufactured purely as mentioned before from new zealand sheep wool the intermediate filament protein is the protein that gives natural hair fibers their strength this protein is really clever in how it works it coats the outside of the hair shaft in a shield which protects from nasty pollutants it penetrates the hair fibers and starts working to heal hair from the inside out the combined action makes it so effective – it’s basically a liquid form of hair as well as healing your hair from the inside out it takes on the damage itself so your hair doesn’t how cool is that the nasty environmental pollutants that damage hair include cigarette smoke uv radiation and sulfur dioxide gas from car and truck exhaust fumes it’s especially important to use replicine functional keratin technology after chemically straightening hair because the straightening agent formaldehyde destroys the hair structure in the straightening process and the keratin is what ‘heals’ it again in the next blog post we’ll discuss exactly how to decipher that scientific jargon on the back of your hair care products…so stay tuned be sociable share tweet ← keratin  what is keratin

click to read more on may   at  pm said reply wonderful post but i was wanting to know if you could write a litte more on this topic i’d be very grateful if you could elaborate a little bit further thank you keratin questions on may   at  pm said reply that’s a bit of an open ended question…there is a great deal that could be said on keratins products that contain keratins and what they can do for you perhaps it would be helpful to talk a bit about the functionality of the different keratin ingredients that are available out there “hydrolyzed keratin” is from a process where a keratin source is treated with a chemical such as caustic which breaks up the keratin into small water soluble components known as peptides these will contain a few – usually less than  amino acids linked together amino acids are the basic building blocks of all proteins and there are  that are most common the peptides are small so able to transfer easily across the skin and get into the crevices in your hair they will also draw water into your skin with them so acting as a “humectants” but because of the process by which they have been extracted from the keratin source they will form only weak attachments with the proteins in hair and have lost much of their original functionality in contrast replicine™ functional keratin® is produced by patented processes that retains the functionality of the keratins replicine™ contains three broad groups of keratins which are listed in the ingredients as keratin hydrolyzed keratin and oxidized keratin or as subsets of these three groups the” keratin” has been extracted from new zealand sheep wool by a gentle process that retains the full length of the proteins and their functionality these large proteins also known as intermediate filament proteins have fascinating properties and are able to form films and realign with each other back into the helical forms that are present in keratin structures they are great for providing a protective layer to hair and skin and because the functionality of the cysteine amino acids has been retained in the keratins they are able recrosslink with your hair to form durable bonds that can help with small cracks and tears in the shaft and in the protective cuticle layer of your hair like “hydrolyzed keratin” extracted via other processes the hydrolyzed keratin that is the second group in replicine™ functional keratin® is small and able to penetrate into your skin and the hair shaft drawing in moisture along with it however in contrast to conventional hydrolyzed keratin replicine™ hydrolyzed keratins still retains the functionality of the cysteine amino acids and so are able to crosslink with the keratin of your hair the oxidized keratin within replicine™ has been shown through science research to have some amazing properties this ingredient is used in wound healing products as it accelerates the rate of healing through increasing activity of keratinocytes in the wound it has also been shown to promote the production of collagens  and  which are situated in the skin at the dermalepidermal junction this helps to repair and strengthen the junction and incidentally reversing the development of wrinkles which begin at this point through the aging loss of collagen  and  oxidised keratin has retained the amino acid sequence of the original keratin source and is able align with the proteins in hair forming what are known as ”hydrogen bonds” and “salt bridges” to help repair to give hair back its strength and shine collectively these keratin types within replicine™ functional keratin® promote the production of glutathione within the skin which is the cells own master antioxidant which helps counteract the impacts of environmental stress and aging that’s a fairly whirlwind description of the different types of keratins and their activity in skin and in hair as discovered through the recent research undertaken with replicine if you have any more questions please come back to us su bonga on may   at  pm said reply care of the hair and care of the scalp skin may appear separate but are actually intertwined because hair grows from beneath the skin the living parts of hair hair follicle hair root root sheath and sebaceous gland are beneath the skin while the actual hair shaft which emerges the cuticle which covers the cortex and medulla has no living processes damage or changes made to the visible hair shaft cannot be repaired by a biological process though much can be done to manage hair and ensure that the cuticle remains intact’ most popular writeup coming from our personal website httpmelatoninfaqcom keratin questions on may   at  pm said reply you are quite right that damages to the hair shaft cannot be repaired by a biological process however it is possible to “glue” small splits in the shaft and cuticle with an appropriate material replicine™ functional keratin® has been extracted from clean new zealand sheep wool and is the same as the keratins in your hair unlike other extraction processes the replicine™ process is able to extract the long proteins intact retaining the amino acid sequences while also maintaining the crosslinking functionality of the cysteine that holds the proteins together in your hair naturally these properties allow the replicine™ proteins to align with the proteins in your hair and form durable bridges across spaces where the hair shaft has begun to come apart the replicine™ functional keratin® will also coat the hair shaft crosslinking with the cuticle of your hair to provide a smooth and glossy protective layer helping to add body and shine to your hair but unlike silicones these proteins are chemically identical to your hair so do not interfere with the transfer of dyes or conditioning agents tolu on january   at  pm said reply i have stopped using hair relaxer on my hair in the past  months with the aim of going natural  but being an african my hair is all so thick
