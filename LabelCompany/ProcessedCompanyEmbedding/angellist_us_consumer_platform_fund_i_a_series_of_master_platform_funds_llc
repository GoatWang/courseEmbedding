indicating interest matters quality is measured by track record—the valuation of the startups a person has invested in founded worked at etc   ◙ angelist syndicates how it works a syndicate allows investors to participate in a lead investors deals in exchange investors pay the lead carry investors get access to deals leads get carry and startups get more capital with fewer meetings investors get access to a leads investments and benefit from her experience in picking and managing investments investors can also invest as little as k leads get carry for their investments they can invest –x their typical investment amount which gives them access to more deals and allows them to lead more deals they may also get major investor rights finally leads get access to syndicate investors who are often experts in the startup’s market startups get more capital with fewer meetings they get the attention of a lead who is making a large investment they get access to the syndicate investors’ networks without putting each one on the cap table and they can easily collect many small investments  legal structure of a syndicate syndicate investors dont invest directly in a company they invest in a special purpose fund that is created specifically for each investment this fund then invests in the company the corporate form of the fund is an llc the fund is managed by assure fund management and advised by angellist advisors a whollyowned subsidiary of angellist the lead also serves as a contractor of angellist advisors  the lead does not invest through the fund but is required to disclose to angellist advisors how she votes or if she buys or sells shares  if there is a lead the fund will usually vote with the lead unless she has a conflict of interest or there are other unusual circumstances if there is no lead the fund will usually vote with the majority of other shareholders investor limit due to securities regulations syndicates can only accept  investors in a deal a small number of investments support qualified purchasers who are exempt from this requirement  qualified purchasers include individuals with m in investment assets and companies with m in investment assets a syndicate deal can accept up to  qualified purchasers at the same time as  accredited but not qualified investors   ◙ investors investors information rights

information about the company’s customers or financing it will generally not include any figures any information investors need for taxes such as ks is distributed annually how investors receive their profits you will receive your profits if any when the company is acquired or has an ipo there may also be other opportunities for the syndicate to sell its shares when there is an exit opportunity angellist advisors in consultation with the lead will advise the syndicate fund regarding the best time to sell the syndicates’ shares the decision to sell the shares is then made by assure fund management this will generally happen soon after the shares become liquid if there are any profits they are distributed to the syndicate investors the syndicate fund like all investors is

offerboard a platform for soliciting investments in private businesses posted feb   by john mannes johnmannes  shares next story international startups sign up for a country pavilion at disrupt ny entoro group today announced that it has acquired offerboard a company that removes barriers from the process of raising capital offerboard isn’t angellist nor fundersclub it’s a platform designed to make crowdfunding work for growth capital but instead of tech startups the company supports general solicitation for multimillion dollar financing projects in spaces like realestate and oil and gas the acquisition is to bring the platform inhouse so entoro group can support its own deals the reason offerboard can do this is title ii of the jobs act when title ii went into effect in late september of  it was largely ignored by the tech community at least with respect to naval ravikant and co’s title iii which brought equity crowdfunding into the everyday valley lexicon but to chris tyrrell title ii aka the legalization of general solicitation was where the real money was going to be made in the past it was illegal for private companies to publicly advertise that they were raising investment but even after the laws changed it was tough to actually raise money because more traditional industries lacked the software infrastructure to support solicitation though offerboard exists in different forms for each client and use case it is that infrastructure in its simplest form james row managing director of the entoro group gives the example of a private company looking to finance a drilling program to explain the synergies that offerboard will bring to entoro a business with k acres of leased property and the right to drill still needs money to build wells at this level that generally means raising s of millions of dollars said company would approach entoro and they would run diligence and piece together a preferred equity deal to finance it “energy is the ideal space because it has known deal flow” asserted row  “there is a fragmented gap between buyers and sellers we just need to be a better match maker” offerboard originally launched out of stealth on the stage of techcrunch disrupt new york in  tyrrell was working for a family office at the time he thought of the idea but the way he got into the startup ring was unorthodox rather than bootstrap in a garage in menlo park he bought tickets to australia and nabbed the license to a technology being developed by a public australian company between then and now the company hosted over  million worth of deals across a variety of industries but instead of building out a software platform company tyrrell decided to match his market entry strategy with an equally unorthodox way out selling to a houstonbased investment bank in a wonky transaction that also involves the merging of clearinghouse securities and ofscap llc to form the aforementioned entoro group that is ultimately purchasing offerboard at the time of the sale offerboard had hosted an estimated  deals at an average of  million in value this brought the company about  million in total revenue roughly split across the last three years as  million  million and  million “i came to a realization that companies with a niche were going to win the day” said tyrrell “the winners will start now and win  years from now” but despite growth tyrrell insisted that the industry supporting equity as a whole is running  years behind debt platforms the group has been slowly winding down its practice to slow growth and become profitable streamlining by cutting its  person workforce in half offerboard raised a total of  million from nine investors that largely consisted of highnetworth individuals and family offices tyrrell will be joining the board of the entoro group but won’t be taking a formal role beyond that  shares advertisement advertisement crunchbase angellist founded  overview angellist is a community of
