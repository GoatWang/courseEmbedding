the boston company asset management launches mlp and eventdriven alternative strategies for the boston company asset management launches mlp and eventdriven alternative strategies for institutional investors pine cobble capital founders bring expertise to bny mellon investment boutique dec    et from bny mellon new york dec   prnewswire  the boston company asset management llc tbcam a bostonbased bny mellon boutique that invests in active equity has launched two new strategies for institutional investors – an energy infrastructure strategy that utilizes master limited partnerships mlps and an eventdriven absolute return strategy  to manage these offerings tbcam has brought on an experienced team that founded and managed pine cobble capital llc along with their existing strategies and assets    the energy infrastructure strategy invests primarily in companies that own and operate midstream assets such as pipelines terminals and processing facilities which have long useful lives and offer attractive rates of return the strategy focuses on generating total returns through a combination of current yield distribution growth and the identification of catalysts that could affect cash flow and market perception this strategy invests in mlps corporations that control mlps or midstream assets and other companies influenced by developments in us energy infrastructure the eventdriven strategy invests in a concentrated number of long and short positions with potential value drivers such as financial or corporate structure changes operational restructurings mergers and acquisitions or special situations  this strategy is focused primarily on us small and midcapitalization equities and also opportunistically invests across the capital structure in corporate credit securities  bart grenier chief executive officer and chief investment officer for tbcam said the launch of these two strategies significantly strengthens our alternative investment capabilities at a time when institutional investors are increasingly looking for new investment options we believe the energy infrastructure sector presents a compelling opportunity for a catalystdriven total return approach due to the combination of attractive current yield strong distribution growth potential and a dynamic industry environment moreover the bottomup valueoriented process employed by the eventdriven strategy is a good fit with the boston companys fundamental approach the two strategies are managed by robert a nicholson and zev d nijensohn who joined tbcam in november  as senior managing directors and senior portfolio managers from pine cobble capital llc which they cofounded in   the team will continue to take the same approach it utilized at pine cobble and has transitioned the strategies and assets it managed to tbcam prior to cofounding pine cobble nicholson served as a managing director and general partner at spectrum equity investors a private equity firm focused on media communications business and consumer services and technology previously he was a consultant at bain  company nicholson received his bachelors degree with honors in economics from williams college and an mba with high distinction from harvard business school nijensohn was previously a senior analyst at empyrean capital lp a multistrategy eventdriven hedge fund where he covered telecom media financial services and business services he also was a research analyst at shumway capital a principal at spectrum equity investors and a mergers and acquisitions analyst at robertson stephens nijensohn holds an ab in history from dartmouth college fundamental analysis is core to what we do and its also at the core of the boston company said nicholson  we look forward to contributing our

what is an event driven strategy an event driven strategy is a strategy adopted by hedge fund managers that attempts to take advantage of events such as mergers and restructurings that can result in the shortterm mispricing of a companys stock an eventdriven strategy focuses on exploiting the tendency of the equities of companies in a time of change to drop in price breaking down event driven strategy investors often become concerned when a company is going through a corporate reorganization restructuring merger acquisition or other major event this can lead the stock price to stagnate until investors feel comfortable with its stability again when a hedge fund manager or other eventdriven strategist finds a potential investment he or she will examine the underlying value of the company and the situation surrounding the event including potential regulatory pitfalls if he or she feels positive about the event and the strength of the company he or she may buy shares to sell

take advantage of transaction announcements and other onetime events one example is merger arbitrage which is used in the event of an acquisition announcement and involves buying the stock of the target company and hedging the purchase by selling short the stock of the acquiring company usually at announcement the purchase price that the acquiring company will pay to buy its target exceeds the current trading price of the target company the merger arbitrageur bets the acquisition will happen and cause the target companys price to converge rise to the purchase price that the acquiring company pays this also is not pure arbitrage if the market happens to frown on the deal the acquisition may unravel and send the stock of the acquirer up in relief and the target companys stock down wiping out the temporary bump which would cause a loss for the position there are various types of eventdriven strategies one other example is distressed securities which involves investing in companies that are reorganizing or have been unfairly beaten down another interesting type of eventdriven fund is the activist fund which is predatory in nature this type takes sizable positions in

to respond with heftier trade promotion spends — up three straight years into  to a lofty  of cpg sales  looking ahead these private label gains will cause trade promotion to “continue to play the largest role in the marketing mix representing over 0 of all spending” predicts donald stuart coo kantar retail“if you also include the shopper marketing expenditure it represents more than 0 of the marketing dollars  thus  of every 0 are channeled through the retailer  the retailer owns the khyber pass and all manufacturers must pass through” he addsother experts agree trade spend has risen but cite different reasons beyond private label  the rise “has been driven as much by consumer focus on price value given the tough economy more so than private label increases” says paul thompson managing director henry rak consulting partners “in fact 0 of categories in the center store had an increase in ‘price only’ support according to the  iri merchandising trends report  in branddriven categories such as cereal with a 0 private label share cpg companies are less likely to overpromote to compete with private label  however in productdriven categories such as milk with a  pl share cpg fights to drive share through price”since cpg companies feel privatelabel issues aren’t controllable cpg “looks the other way“ observes jim hertel managing partner willard bishop  “so they aren’t viewing private label as the threat it was when we saw such inflation in early  i think companies are spending relative to their own objectives and not specifically with private label in mind  if inflation continues to worsen and consumers resume trading down in price as they did before i suspect cpg trade promotion spending will rise again”indeed commodity price hikes are raising product costs and retail prices in  if trade promotion spending does rise as hertel suggests it would resume its longterm ascent following a recent respite where spending abated to  of cpg sales  stuart cites several reasons for this downtick  a slow strengthening of the economy and partial return to traditional brandbuying habits and a sales shift to everyday low price outlets where trade spend may not be capturedwith price volatility in the picture today and retailers motivated to push store brands because of their exclusivity and high margins cpg should tradepromote to effectively manage the price gaps between their brands and private label  “most cpg companies understand their trade efficiencies such as cost per incremental unit and will stay true to their funding principles  the next step which many have yet to take is to understand what the sustainable price gaps are between their brands and private labels both promoted and not promoted and to translate those insights into a category business plan that drives mutual profit growth for retailer category level and cpg brandpromoted group alike” states hertelstuart and thompson also take consumercentric approachesstuart urges cpg trade managers to “understand not only the roi of an investment but also the shortterm and longterm changes in shopper behavior”  and he poses analytical questions for cpg to assess event results  did we attract new users competitive users  did they stay with the brand  what was the impact not just during the immediate promotion but beyond how did the trade event benefit the franchise relative to alternate marketing expenditurescpg needs to fully understand the role of everyday price in the consumerdecision process of buying the brand states thompson  “i would not be spending trade dollars to unnecessarily subsidize retail price points that may not be critical  unnecessary subsidization robs profit or the ability to spend against building equity for the brand”   also important to know the critical promoted price points to avoid overdiscounting and the promotion frequency that ensures a brand gets its fairshare promotional volume  “we see many cpg companies spending large amounts of trade dollars to subsidize lower everyday retail price points without understanding if that spend is really effective or necessary” thompson addsoverspending is a particular temptation for smaller brands that have less influence and impact over category plans and results  “they have to be more disciplined at establishing and adhering to their own spending principles” says hertelyet number  and number  brands can develop loyal niches within categories that have significant need for variety whether driven by taste convenience or efficacy explains stuart  smart trading spending can help lowcost manufacturers win “that have efficiencies of scale that rival private label and can keep their everyday gap to a minimum” he notesthe three experts agreed that innovation is the surest differentiator of brands versus private label  “launching meaningful innovations well is the highest priority in our view” says hertelal heller is coauthor consumercentric category management nielsenwiley and president distinct communications llcjune tpm forecast for  is definitely uncertain  by al hellertrade promotion activity could face a crossroads within the next  to  months  retailers’ narrow focus on profits and on private label as an engine for margin dollars limits merchandising opportunities for national brands and raises performance expectations for each cpgfunded trade event  concurrently cpg companies scrutinize what they spend on trade as they figure strategies to raise roi says jesse edelman coo of archpoint consulting  this could tempt cpg to target fewer yet bigger trade events with larger chains where they see the chance to move the needle on their business  that’s more complex to do  large chain circulars are often filled with national brands and private label—and the emphasis on these leaves fewer promotional opportunities for other brands” he told cpgmatters in an exclusive interview  alternately cpg could partner with regional chains such as wegmans price chopper publix and schnucks which “out of necessity have to become more receptive to almost becoming learning laboratories for manufacturers” suggests edelman  “there’s an evergrowing divide of haves and have nots between the larger and regional chains forcing differences in how they go to market” if cpg companies get over their desire to scale with large retailers they could succeed with midtier operators that are nimbler and would more readily use inventive trade promotions to help differentiate their stores within trading areas“they’re more interesting places to do business they’re more open to creativity in assortment shelving displays messaging and events to influence consumers” he adds  “great opportunities continue to emerge at the regional level”archpoint urges cpg suppliers to segment retail customers by their value to ongoing business and to evaluate criteria beyond revenue  a first step is to selfassess using these questions and insightsdoes your trade spend deliver a return on investment companies think they know but they don’t necessarily measure the right way it isn’t only about cases moved during a promotion event but also an event’s influence on subsequent base shipments and other measuresdo you measure every dollar invested  this is the black hole in the budget where leakage occurs  the effect of  “net pricing” or “special pricing” often isn’t factored into trade spend so it winds up influencing other parts of the profitloss statementdoes your sales team effectively plan execute and measure results achieved manufacturers continually seek more impactful ways to spend beyond funding temporary price reductions perhaps instore coupons or joint promotions with other brands would work better with certain brands or shoppers  still some level of mediocrity won’t go away  cpg executives utter the phrase ‘if we don’t spend it we’ll lose the budget’ too oftenis there a process in place to accrue allocate and manage trade budgets a trade promotion management tpm system only enables a company’s process it doesn’t create onehow are decisions made relative to trade promotions who approves this reflects a company’s confidence in its lower levels of management to make decisions on trade promotions say up to 00  there is so little trust however that decisions are increasingly pushed back into large trade marketing departments is a process in place to effectively handle claims and deductions many smaller and mediumsized cpg companies put people against this function which could be automated instead   cpg should approach this with an “it’s my money” attitude since unauthorized deductions can significantly harm cash flowclearly databased insights are key to effectively managing trade promotions they help alleviate the sameness of trade promotions and help increase their consumer relevancy yet fewer than half of cpg companies have an automated system in place to steadily monitor and evaluate their trade spend and performance edelman estimates  “consumer preference is the ultimate deciding factor in what sells through but it isn’t in the trade promotion conversation enough between retailer and cpg partners” says edelman  “it would be best if consumers were at the heart of the conversation”that could happen increasingly as more cpg companies aim to optimize trade promotions using predictive analytics a discipline on the rise particularly among larger cpg brand marketers  their goal is to make events more productive by building off an understanding of consumer behaviors spending patterns
