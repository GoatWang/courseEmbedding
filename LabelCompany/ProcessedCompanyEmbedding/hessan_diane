diane hessan  business innovation factory skip to main content search form search meet the bif team diane hessan president and chief executive officer communispace diane hessan has been working at the intersection of marketing and customerfocused innovation her entire career and ever since she opened her first successful lemonade stand in  she knew she was destined to lead fastgrowing exciting companies but what gets her really jazzed every day is the changing face of marketing marketing is clearly under siege she says were moving from a process of persuasion to a process of conversation and the customer is leading the charge as president and ceo of communispace—the company helps global organizations build manage and facilitate private online customer communities—hessan has learned a thing or two about customer engagement i wrote a book in the mids about how to grow your company by focusing on your customer most of what i talked about then applies even more today says hessan as marketers learn how to listen harder to customers—to what is said and to what is not said—the conversations get better and emotional connections deepen hessan says customer engagement is not instant pudding but knowing their ideas are valued customers do share more which increases their value to the company and the companys value to them savvy executives know that they need to better understand their customers to innovate develop more successful products faster than competitors and build loyalty she explains the explosion of online social networks confirms that people want to be part of communities build relationships with people they identify with and be heard this is why more and more innovative companies are creating their own private social networks of customers hessan describes them as the ‘antimyspace she helped found communispace in  because she saw nascent online customer communities and forums as an untapped opportunity for marketers to hardwire customers into their businesses since its inception communispace has created over  private communities for fortune  companies theres really no other way to get to know so many customers so well explains hessan panels chatrooms blogs and focus groups just skim the surface compared to what marketers can learn from their own online customer communities if its small private and select you can get more engagement than much larger communities explains hessan you control who youre talking to its not the lonelyhearts club and its not your competitor pretending to be someone else most important by establishing that continuous connection companies create a twoway dialog which provides real ongoing value kraft foods is one of communispaces clients over the past year the company has introduced an array of new products that were developed in cooperation with their customers for instance three years ago krafts nabisco group asked online participants what diet food represented to them and how they made snack choices kraft learned that customers didnt feel they needed to deprive themselves—what they really wanted was the ability to control how much they ate last year kraft sold  million worth of  calorie packs explains hessan and the products were conceptualized vetted packaged and positioned with the involvement of customers every step of the way customer engagement is not about just asking questions and getting feedback although plenty of that goes on in communities explains hessan she also says its not about responding to and trying to fix negative issues that customers may raise its really about creating a sense of community among people with common interests and then tapping into the community in multiple ways through multiple methodologies to get into the hearts and minds of customers hessan says that on average customers spend  minutes per week in a particular community one of the biggest reasons why people come back all the time is because its very cool to think the company is listening to you she says trust is the currency that organizations need to create thats the evolution of marketing according to hessan understanding and insight comes from relationships not research and an extraordinary  of community participants believe the sponsoring company is going to do something based on their feedback its an usual experience to feel that you really have a voice she says so the secret to customer engagement is genuinely wanting to involve customers and then being willing to shut up and listen to what they have to say next up meet liz ouk office coordinator crystal rome

of communispace one of the fastest growing social networking companies in the country a pioneer in creating online communities to help marketers deeply engage customers the company has built and managed more than  private online customer communities for an impressive collection of fortune  companies communispaces revenues have nearly doubled year over year for the past three years and it has

her professional recognition diane is a highly soughtafter speaker and expert in the social networking arena also shes cofounder of the sound bytes an a cappella group that writes lyrics about business and performs at major conferences tompeterscom asks  in the interest of full disclosure you know tom peters quite well dh we met around  years ago while filming a roundtable discussion of five gurus i recall that tom nicholas negroponte and i were three of the five and nicholas was the serious one that sounds like a fun panel dh it was i met tom while sitting next to him when they were putting makeup on us tom usually doesnt let them put makeup on him dh thats how i should tell the story although tom does not like wearing makeup he put up with it just to be able to have a conversation with me laughter i was very passionate about what tom was doing at the time because i have spent my entire professional life trying to help companies listen to their customers so when he wrote get close to your customers and described it as strategically critical i just couldnt spend enough time with him i was always passionate about that but he really made it a game changer hes on your board of advisors dh thats correct what does communispace do dh we are using the web to transform the way the companies listen to their customers communispace helps bring the customer to life for major brands we do that by building online communities  proprietary to each client company giving them a continuous connection to their target consumers the results deep insights very fast at half the cost of traditional methods weve been doing this since  its a hot business now because all of a sudden were not only nextgeneration market research but were also social media our solution is turnkey we build the sites recruit and screen consumers facilitate their ongoing conversations analyze and report on the results and more the client gets an asset called voice of the customer that they can use on a continuous basis im glad you filled that in for instance i think meredith corporation an umbrella group for a number of womenoriented magazines such as ladies home journal is one of your clients i went to ladieshomejournalcom and on their navigation bar theres something called community when i click on community am i then entering the world of communispace dh no when youre clicking on community my guess is that you are getting connected to a public site created by meredith that allows their readers to come online and engage with each other our meredith community is a private group and our members most likely had a voice in how the public community looks and works meredith is transforming from a conventional magazine publishing company to a st century media and marketing company that serves women doing that requires that they get really clear about who their customers are whats going on in their lives how they use the web what they think about the world and a hundred other questions then they build their marketing strategy around what really works for those customers sometimes our communities are called a focus group on steroids if a focus group is ten people sitting in a room for an hour communispace is  people sitting in that room all the time meredith thus has a way to ensure that what they do resonates with its customers  and this drives their growth agenda listening is a really underrated marketing strategy so you help your clients figure out how best to communicate with their customers dh look at the economy its a terrible time to lose touch with customers ask any ceo howre you going to manage through these times how are you going to grow once you get out of them theyll say the most important thing weve got to do is to understand our customers why would you want to do that faster innovation more effective marketing guidance around strategy increased loyalty or just staying current good research doesnt have to be ad hoc a community provides continuity so that listening to customers is no longer a project or a study i saw a minicase study at your site about hp a woman at hp spoke about getting customers to help them with the design of things—the look and feel—and maybe running a new website designed by customers im wondering does this get much more strategic than that are they looking to these customers to influence strategic decisions for a company dh absolutely what do i mean by that dozens of innovations have come out of our communities now remember its not like a client says to the consumer gee we need a new product idea and the consumer says gee kraft i think you need  calorie packs heres what it should look like unfortunately it doesnt quite work that way dh no its more of a conversation if a client is doing a good job in our communities half of what they do is what we call plain old feedback and validation they might ask what the consumer thinks about their products for instance do you like this tropicana package or hey facebook users what do you think about our privacy policy those are really important things to run by consumers as we all know so thats what we call feedback in our vernacular what the really great marketers will also do is not just test ideas theyll be far more exploratory well have people keeping a diary of whats going on in their lives making a video tour of their home making a collage or taking photographs of the things that really matter to them there are a million other creative activities where youre not necessarily saying give us a great idea for a new product you are trying to understand consumers in a much more fundamental way —to truly walk in their shoes people are very often more honest when theyre online if you create a community and you build a lot of trust people will tell you things that theyve never talked about before the insights that you gain are often profound another upside to using a community is speed an executive could say oh damn its  i have a big presentation tomorrow and i need an early read on this particular idea or issue to deliver on this we dont have to go out and start recruiting a bunch of people to help us because theyre already there we can get a client an early read by  oclock that night and executives just love that these folks in the communities are that reliable dh if you run the community well yes weve been doing this since  and over the years weve made a huge number of mistakes at this point given its the only thing we do were really experienced at it i read that communispace was originally a software service that companies used internally for collaboration is that true dh it was thats true you turned that inside out how did that shift happen dh we had one idea and we were really struggling with it we were having a hard time getting people to use the software we were trying to get employees to collaborate with each other it was nice to have in the view of organizations at least in  it wasnt mission critical we had a lucky day we were about to launch an internal community at hallmark and the client said to me i think you guys are terrific but im worried no one is going to use the software and i confessed im worried no one is going to use it either laughter he said i have an idea forty percent of our growth over the next five years needs to come from products and services we dont currently have so what if we put consumers in here brought them together listened to them asked them questions and had them help us grow what about that brilliant dh i said wow i wrote a book about that customercentered growth we tried it it worked the consumers were in there all the time and we started getting really interesting information right away and based on that clients idea and our trying it we totally repositioned the business in  to focus solely on customer communities but back in  id say were building online communities and people would say whats that lonely menopausal women going online to talk about their hot flashes laughter im glad you said that and not me dh i know communities were perceived to be fluff at the time and oh how the world has changed for instance now there are a lot of companies creating employee communities i think of them as communities of practice theyre places for people to come online and collaborate with each other youve recently added a blog to your communispacecom site dh thats right were not exactly the first ones eh we were among the first ones to build a customer community we created a new space in the industry but were definitely not the first to blog so was this a matter of the cobblers kids not having shoes or did you just not see the value in having a blog im curious as to why it took so long and why you then decided to start one dh true confession i resisted having a blog my perception of blogs was that most of them were monologues oneway conversations i believed that we had to be models of dialogue so i didnt think it was critical for us so we just never made it a priority okay but then something happened dh this wont sound very inspired were not a huge company but at communispace our internal think tank spends a million dollars a year on research we study our client communities in order to get better all the time—and to address any questions that a client would want to ask for example if clients ask are the people in the community biased we want to be able to answer them with integrity our research results are often published as white papers on our website and guess what we have so much great research but accessing it was a pain in the neck for people somebody would say i want to see your paper on the myers briggs profile of people who are typically in a community and we wouldnt even be able to find it on our website we finally admitted that we have a lot of knowledge to share and we were making it very difficult for people to actually get to it we realized that we needed a voice are the white papers for clients or for anyone i got the impression that there may be more complete versions of the information elsewhere dh if what you were looking at was not a very detailed case study its probably because the client doesnt want to tell everything we have confidentiality agreements with a lot of our clients because they dont want the world to know what theyre doing its their secret weapon maybe web  will bring people to the point where theyre willing to share more ive worked with some other organizations and theyre starting blogs their blogs skim the surface of what they do i keep thinking if you put some real information out there that people could use in their daytoday lives youd have a much higher readership and youd probably have a lot more clients yet the word proprietary always gets in the way dh it does we have some clients who are willing to share what theyre up to its a great contribution when theyre willing to do that but not everybody is there this might sound silly but the other breakthrough for us with the blogging decision was realizing that we had lots of people who had things to say it wasnt just me and it wasnt just the people who were doing our research it was a communispace professional who was spending all day talking to millennials online for instance his perspective is just different than the way i think about the world because hes  and not  we have about  different people who are blogging nobody edits anything whatever they have to say goes up thats fabulous dh we still have a long way to go but were getting a lot of advice from people who call us and say you know i have another idea for how you can do some innovative things so were working on it are comments enabled at your blog dh oh yes are you kidding id never do a blog without comments look at our business everything we do is about dialogue the way i would measure the success of our blog is not how many people come on and read it it would be the degree to which people are engaged so a perfect blog would be one where every blog post had a hundred comments thats how tom peters measures the success of a blog post by the number of comments it garners the problem is you get into some really silly stuff and nine times out of ten the comments veer off course before somebody brings them back on track we take a very laissezfaire attitude toward the blog im a very strong believer in the fact that a community polices itself when a community member weighs in its much more effective than somebody on staff dh yes and the notion of on track is subjective in our client communities when the members talk to each other about their lives instead of our clients brands you could say thats off track but its often where the gold is its the same for our blog as long as people are engaged thats a good thing oh yes you have to engage in the dialogue you have to blend in even though you are running it its a little tricky dh you said something important which is that tom believes the measure of success is how many comments you have on the blog if that is your goal then the way that you do this is totally different than if you were more concerned with how many visitors you had to your blog in our communities our primary measure of success is participation we dont want people to come into the community and read we want people to come into the community and participate there are people out there who say that in a typical community of a thousand people one percent of the people participate another ten percent will lurk and the rest never show up with what were doing that would be a recipe for disaster the measure of success is creating a community where 6 or 7 percent of the people who are members of the community participate in the conversation they actually say something come up with an idea participate in a brainstorm or fill out a survey how do we get engagement that high you design it that way just like when you design a blog against that kind of an objective its totally different than building a community where you want as many visitors as possible which is another great goal its just not what you do if youre trying to get deep insight every once in awhile we get great insights from our community they just pop out spontaneously from the conversation youre sort of selecting a jury in a larger scale when you put together a community for a client dh its not always a jury i saw an article in the wall street journal about how automotive executives are going to visit somebodys home theyll watch them cook and talk about it people are hungry for the nuance the texture and the emotion behind whats going on with other people in  you dont need to go to somebodys home to be able to get that kind of information with an online community you can have people opening up their homes to you all the time its not always a jury sometimes its just a way for consumers to invite you into their lives and if you can do that you can take the guesswork out of a lot of challenges it sounds like fun does this get to the level of people submitting video dh sure you name it our members fill out complicated surveys participate in discussion boards submit pictures or photos and chat with executives they might go into a brainstorming area fill out a diary do whiteboarding or collaging create a photo album or a video of their family or we might say to them go shopping and send us your register tapes because we want to know what youre buying its unbelievable what people will do if they think youre listening the people who are in our communities know that these brands are listening and that they have a voice they do it for highinvolvement products like airlines and hotels but theyll also do it for toothpaste if you create what we call the social glue i agree it sounds fascinating you and i recently reconnected because i came to a tweetup at your communispace offices in watertown what does twitter mean to a company like communispace dh i just wrote an article for forbes about my twitter experiment i originally just went on twitter out of curiosity and also because clients were asking me about it and i wanted to be able to help them you know ive gone through a whole bunch of phases with it i originally thought what everybody else thinks in the beginning this is just a total waste of my time what am i doing im talking to myself i made a commitment to go for it for six months and see what i could do im a curious person the first hook for me with twitter was that it was not about having everybody listen to what i had to say it was a way for me to learn what other people thought if youre curious about the world and how people think and what makes them laugh and what frustrates them its very interesting to see that slice on twitter now that ive gotten organized and i have a lot of followers i do find that its more of a community for me when i say things now lots of people write back now they know youre a big honcho dh well now its a place where i can test ideas where i can get the word out about things where i can build relationships and where i can rekindle old relationships i found that twitter is just like anything else sometimes its a leap of faith if there are so many people out there that are making a big deal theres got to be a there there right thats my feeling about it too dh its literally a matter of saying im not going about this to prove that its worthless i want to learn what the magic is i decided that i would spend at least a half hour a day for six months and if i didnt get it by then i was just too old now i find that its got all kinds of value so i think its great i just told the boston globe that twitter is like a big cocktail party but that i dont have to wear high heels laughter im also on facebook its like having a yearbook of my life but i dont see it as this vital tool in my life i dont go on every day or spend a lot of time adding content to it however whereas ive dabbled with facebook its completely different for my daughters facebook is their entire world its their preferred email its how they plan parties its where they put pictures of their lives its the first place they go in the morning and the last place they go at night i dont have that experience sometimes new things are about suspending disbelief and jumping into the pool to see if you can figure out where all the fun is im starting to get that from twitter having said that im excited about what the next new tool will be which must be close dont you think dh you would think so wouldnt you i think when wireless connectivity becomes easy to access everywhere thats when innovation will explode the world is changing so fast i always say to clients arent you glad you have a community if you did a big study of consumer behavior and preferences last fall throw it out there is absolutely nothing about what you learned from consumers last fall that you could probably take to the bank right now because the world has changed the news is flying so fast are you following breakingnews on twitter i am not dh oh my gosh follow it i am now first to know about every war every earthquake every airplane problem its enough that i just get my google news mark hursts theory about the digital world is to determine the amount of information you can handle i already know that breaking news on twitter would overwhelm me youre operating at a higher level than i am laughter dh there is a stage of twitter use that i call i am powerful part of the seduction of getting your news on twitter is that your reaction to other news outlets like watching cnn becomes thank you very much for telling me that natasha richardson fell in a skiing accident but frankly i knew about that four hours ago because i am on twitter and i am powerful and thank you for sharing the mumbai story with me but ive actually read all the postings of somebody who was actually hiding in the hotel and i am powerful or i know that you had a really hard time getting the comcast guy to come to your house but i went on twitter and i got him to come within  hours you know why because im on twitter and i get it and im powerful its not just an ego thing i was flying with a friend on jet blue airlines about two weeks ago he called me in a total panic after i arrived home he had left his blackberry on the plane and could not get a live person on jet blues website on our plane ride hed just been telling me how much time i was wasting on twitter i said let me just see if i can find jet blue on twitter i go on twitter and say jet blue can you help is there any way you can connect me with a real person fifteen seconds later theres a guy saying hey last time i checked lots of us were live people i went back privately and said can you call me heres the number within five minutes they had his blackberry and guess what i was powerful he was completely incapable of getting his blackberry because he wasnt powerful we all have those moments as were using new technologies look at all the people on the iphones showing off all their new stuff i dont have one but its obvious that they feel powerful our biggest recruiting source at communispace is existing employees about 6 percent of our new employees come from employee referrals our second biggest source is craigslist its such a powerful tool were so proud that we know how to use craigslist for recruiting im not an evangelist for any of these products but most of our clients are marketers and their world has been completely transformed by whats possible in our communities its better faster cheaper its a great use of the internet to be able to have continuous connection to customers so that you can get their input and insight whenever you need it if we are doing great work our clients say i have communispace and im powerful so many things are possible some of it is your mindset theres probably a personality type thats attracted to this are you a skeptic do you jump on every new thing im sure somebody has done some personality typing youre going to have to look that up dh right maybe ill find out on twitter because im so powerful laughter thanks for your time diane im sorry we didnt get to talk about the red sox dh my favorite subject next time—along with more dirt about tom peters wearing makeup my

in addition to her professional recognition diane is a highly soughtafter speaker and expert in the social networking arena also shes cofounder of the sound bytes an a cappella group that writes lyrics about business and performs at major conferences tompeterscom asks  in the interest of full disclosure you know tom peters quite well dh we met around  years ago while filming a roundtable discussion of five gurus i recall that tom nicholas negroponte and i were three of the five and nicholas was the serious one that sounds like a fun panel dh it was i met tom while sitting next to him when they were putting makeup on us tom usually doesnt let them put makeup on him dh thats how i should tell the story although tom does not like wearing makeup he put up with it just to be able to have a conversation with me laughter i was very passionate about what tom was doing at the time because i have spent my entire professional life trying to help companies listen to their customers so when he wrote get close to your customers and described it as strategically critical i just couldnt spend enough time with him i was always passionate about that but he really made it a game changer hes on your board of advisors dh thats correct what does communispace do dh we are using the web to transform the way the companies listen to their customers communispace helps bring the customer to life for major brands we do that by building online communities  proprietary to each client company giving them a continuous connection to their target consumers the results deep insights very fast at half the cost of traditional methods weve been doing this since  its a hot business now because all of a sudden were not only nextgeneration market research but were also social media our solution is turnkey we build the sites recruit and screen consumers facilitate their ongoing conversations analyze and report on the results and more the client gets an asset called voice of the customer that they can use on a continuous basis im glad you filled that in for instance i think meredith corporation an umbrella group for a number of womenoriented magazines such as ladies home journal is one of your clients i went to ladieshomejournalcom and on their navigation bar theres something called community when i click on community am i then entering the world of communispace dh no when youre clicking on community my guess is that you are getting connected to a public site created by meredith that allows their readers to come online and engage with each other our meredith community is a private group and our members most likely had a voice in how the public community looks and works meredith is transforming from a conventional magazine publishing company to a st century media and marketing company that serves women doing that requires that they get really clear about who their customers are whats going on in their lives how they use the web what they think about the world and a hundred other questions then they build their marketing strategy around what really works for those customers sometimes our communities are called a focus group on steroids if a focus group is ten people sitting in a room for an hour communispace is  people sitting in that room all the time meredith thus has a way to ensure that what they do resonates with its customers  and this drives their growth agenda listening is a really underrated marketing strategy so you help your clients figure out how best to communicate with their customers dh look at the economy its a terrible time to lose touch with customers ask any ceo howre you going to manage through these times how are you going to grow once you get out of them theyll say the most important thing weve got to do is to understand our customers why would you want to do that faster innovation more effective marketing guidance around strategy increased loyalty or just staying current good research doesnt have to be ad hoc a community provides continuity so that listening to customers is no longer a project or a study i saw a minicase study at your site about hp a woman at hp spoke about getting customers to help them with the design of things—the look and feel—and maybe running a new website designed by customers im wondering does this get much more strategic than that are they looking to these customers to influence strategic decisions for a company dh absolutely what do i mean by that dozens of innovations have come out of our communities now remember its not like a client says to the consumer gee we need a new product idea and the consumer says gee kraft i think you need  calorie packs heres what it should look like unfortunately it doesnt quite work that way dh no its more of a conversation if a client is doing a good job in our communities half of what they do is what we call plain old feedback and validation they might ask what the consumer thinks about their products for instance do you like this tropicana package or hey facebook users what do you think about our privacy policy those are really important things to run by consumers as we all know so thats what we call feedback in our vernacular what the really great marketers will also do is not just test ideas theyll be far more exploratory well have people keeping a diary of whats going on in their lives making a video tour of their home making a collage or taking photographs of the things that really matter to them there are a million other creative activities where youre not necessarily saying give us a great idea for a new product you are trying to understand consumers in a much more fundamental way —to truly walk in their shoes people are very often more honest when theyre online if you create a community and you build a lot of trust people will tell you things that theyve never talked about before the insights that you gain are often profound another upside to using a community is speed an executive could say oh damn its  i have a big presentation tomorrow and i need an early read on this particular idea or issue to deliver on this we dont have to go out and start recruiting a bunch of people to help us because theyre already there we can get a client an early read by  oclock that night and executives just love that these folks in the communities are that reliable dh if you run the community well yes weve been doing this since  and over the years weve made a huge number of mistakes at this point given its the only thing we do were really experienced at it i read that communispace was originally a software service that companies used internally for collaboration is that true dh it was thats true you turned that inside out how did that shift happen dh we had one idea and we were really struggling with it we were having a hard time getting people to use the software we were trying to get employees to collaborate with each other it was nice to have in the view of organizations at least in  it wasnt mission critical we had a lucky day we were about to launch an internal community at hallmark and the client said to me i think you guys are terrific but im worried no one is going to use the software and i confessed im worried no one is going to use it either laughter he said i have an idea forty percent of our growth over the next five years needs to come from products and services we dont currently have so what if we put consumers in here brought them together listened to them asked them questions and had them help us grow what about that brilliant dh i said wow i wrote a book about that customercentered growth we tried it it worked the consumers were in there all the time and we started getting really interesting information right away and based on that clients idea and our trying it we totally repositioned the business in  to focus solely on customer communities but back in  id say were building online communities and people would say whats that lonely menopausal women going online to talk about their hot flashes laughter im glad you said that and not me dh i know communities were perceived to be fluff at the time and oh how the world has changed for instance now there are a lot of companies creating employee communities i think of them as communities of practice theyre places for people to come online and collaborate with each other youve recently added a blog to your communispacecom site dh thats right were not exactly the first ones eh we were among the first ones to build a customer community we created a new space in the industry but were definitely not the first to blog so was this a matter of the cobblers kids not having shoes or did you just not see the value in having a blog im curious as to why it took so long and why you then decided to start one dh true confession i resisted having a blog my perception of blogs was that most of them were monologues oneway conversations i believed that we had to be models of dialogue so i didnt think it was critical for us so we just never made it a priority okay but then something happened dh this wont sound very inspired were not a huge company but at communispace our internal think tank spends a million dollars a year on research we study our client communities in order to get better all the time—and to address any questions that a client would want to ask for example if clients ask are the people in the community biased we want to be able to answer them with integrity our research results are often published as white papers on our website and guess what we have so much great research but accessing it was a pain in the neck for people somebody would say i want to see your paper on the myers briggs profile of people who are typically in a community and we wouldnt even be able to find it on our website we finally admitted that we have a lot of knowledge to share and we were making it very difficult for people to actually get to it we realized that we needed a voice are the white papers for clients or for anyone i got the impression that there may be more complete versions of the information elsewhere dh if what you were looking at was not a very detailed case study its probably because the client doesnt want to tell everything we have confidentiality agreements with a lot of our clients because they dont want the world to know what theyre doing its their secret weapon maybe web  will bring people to the point where theyre willing to share more ive worked with some other organizations and theyre starting blogs their blogs skim the surface of what they do i keep thinking if you put some real information out there that people could use in their daytoday lives youd have a much higher readership and youd probably have a lot more clients yet the word proprietary always gets in the way dh it does we have some clients who are willing to share what theyre up to its a great contribution when theyre willing to do that but not everybody is there this might sound silly but the other breakthrough for us with the blogging decision was realizing that we had lots of people who had things to say it wasnt just me and it wasnt just the people who were doing our research it was a communispace professional who was spending all day talking to millennials online for instance his perspective is just different than the way i think about the world because hes  and not  we have about  different people who are blogging nobody edits anything whatever they have to say goes up thats fabulous dh we still have a long way to go but were getting a lot of advice from people who call us and say you know i have another idea for how you can do some innovative things so were working on it are comments enabled at your blog dh oh yes are you kidding id never do a blog without comments look at our business everything we do is about dialogue the way i would measure the success of our blog is not how many people come on and read it it would be the degree to which people are engaged so a perfect blog would be one where every blog post had a hundred comments thats how tom peters measures the success of a blog post by the number of comments it garners the problem is you get into some really silly stuff and nine times out of ten the comments veer off course before somebody brings them back on track we take a very laissezfaire attitude toward the blog im a very strong believer in the fact that a community polices itself when a community member weighs in its much more effective than somebody on staff dh yes and the notion of on track is subjective in our client communities when the members talk to each other about their lives instead of our clients brands you could say thats off track but its often where the gold is its the same for our blog as long as people are engaged thats a good thing oh yes you have to engage in the dialogue you have to blend in even though you are running it its a little tricky dh you said something important which is that tom believes the measure of success is how many comments you have on the blog if that is your goal then the way that you do this is totally different than if you were more concerned with how many visitors you had to your blog in our communities our primary measure of success is participation we dont want people to come into the community and read we want people to come into the community and participate there are people out there who say that in a typical community of a thousand people one percent of the people participate another ten percent will lurk and the rest never show up with what were doing that would be a recipe for disaster the measure of success is creating a community where 6 or 7 percent of the people who are members of the community participate in the conversation they actually say something come up with an idea participate in a brainstorm or fill out a survey how do we get engagement that high you design it that way just like when you design a blog against that kind of an objective its totally different than building a community where you want as many visitors as possible which is another great goal its just not what you do if youre trying to get deep insight every once in awhile we get great insights from our community they just pop out spontaneously from the conversation youre sort of selecting a jury in a larger scale when you put together a community for a client dh its not always a jury i saw an article in the wall street journal about how automotive executives are going to visit somebodys home theyll watch them cook and talk about it people are hungry for the nuance the texture and the emotion behind whats going on with other people in  you dont need to go to somebodys home to be able to get that kind of information with an online community you can have people opening up their homes to you all the time its not always a jury sometimes its just a way for consumers to invite you into their lives and if you can do that you can take the guesswork out of a lot of challenges it sounds like fun does this get to the level of people submitting video dh sure you name it our members fill out complicated surveys participate in discussion boards submit pictures or photos and chat with executives they might go into a brainstorming area fill out a diary do whiteboarding or collaging create a photo album or a video of their family or we might say to them go shopping and send us your register tapes because we want to know what youre buying its unbelievable what people will do if they think youre listening the people who are in our communities know that these brands are listening and that they have a voice they do it for highinvolvement products like airlines and hotels but theyll also do it for toothpaste if you create what we call the social glue i agree it sounds fascinating you and i recently reconnected because i came to a tweetup at your communispace offices in watertown what does twitter mean to a company like communispace dh i just wrote an article for forbes about my twitter experiment i originally just went on twitter out of curiosity and also because clients were asking me about it and i wanted to be able to help them you know ive gone through a whole bunch of phases with it i originally thought what everybody else thinks in the beginning this is just a total waste of my time what am i doing im talking to myself i made a commitment to go for it for six months and see what i could do im a curious person the first hook for me with twitter was that it was not about having everybody listen to what i had to say it was a way for me to learn what other people thought if youre curious about the world and how people think and what makes them laugh and what frustrates them its very interesting to see that slice on twitter now that ive gotten organized and i have a lot of followers i do find that its more of a community for me when i say things now lots of people write back now they know youre a big honcho dh well now its a place where i can test ideas where i can get the word out about things where i can build relationships and where i can rekindle old relationships i found that twitter is just like anything else sometimes its a leap of faith if there are so many people out there that are making a big deal theres got to be a there there right thats my feeling about it too dh its literally a matter of saying im not going about this to prove that its worthless i want to learn what the magic is i decided that i would spend at least a half hour a day for six months and if i didnt get it by then i was just too old now i find that its got all kinds of value so i think its great i just told the boston globe that twitter is like a big cocktail party but that i dont have to wear high heels laughter im also on facebook its like having a yearbook of my life but i dont see it as this vital tool in my life i dont go on every day or spend a lot of time adding content to it however whereas ive dabbled with facebook its completely different for my daughters facebook is their entire world its their preferred email its how they plan parties its where they put pictures of their lives its the first place they go in the morning and the last place they go at night i dont have that experience sometimes new things are about suspending disbelief and jumping into the pool to see if you can figure out where all the fun is im starting to get that from twitter having said that im excited about what the next new tool will be which must be close dont you think dh you would think so wouldnt you i think when wireless connectivity becomes easy to access everywhere thats when innovation will explode the world is changing so fast i always say to clients arent you glad you have a community if you did a big study of consumer behavior and preferences last fall throw it out there is absolutely nothing about what you learned from consumers last fall that you could probably take to the bank right now because the world has changed the news is flying so fast are you following breakingnews on twitter i am not dh oh my gosh follow it i am now first to know about every war every earthquake every airplane problem its enough that i just get my google news mark hursts theory about the digital world is to determine the amount of information you can handle i already know that breaking news on twitter would overwhelm me youre operating at a higher level than i am laughter dh there is a stage of twitter use that i call i am powerful part of the seduction of getting your news on twitter is that your reaction to other news outlets like watching cnn becomes thank you very much for telling me that natasha richardson fell in a skiing accident but frankly i knew about that four hours ago because i am on twitter and i am powerful and thank you for sharing the mumbai story with me but ive actually read all the postings of somebody who was actually hiding in the hotel and i am powerful or i know that you had a really hard time getting the comcast guy to come to your house but i went on twitter and i got him to come within  hours you know why because im on twitter and i get it and im powerful its not just an ego thing i was flying with a friend on jet blue airlines about two weeks ago he called me in a total panic after i arrived home he had left his blackberry on the plane and could not get a live person on jet blues website on our plane ride hed just been telling me how much time i was wasting on twitter i said let me just see if i can find jet blue on twitter i go on twitter and say jet blue can you help is there any way you can connect me with a real person fifteen seconds later theres a guy saying hey last time i checked lots of us were live people i went back privately and said can you call me heres the number within five minutes they had his blackberry and guess what i was powerful he was completely incapable of getting his blackberry because he wasnt powerful we all have those moments as were using new technologies look at all the people on the iphones showing off all their new stuff i dont have one but its obvious that they feel powerful our biggest recruiting source at communispace is existing employees about 6 percent of our new employees come from employee referrals our second biggest source is craigslist its such a powerful tool were so proud that we know how to use craigslist for recruiting im not an evangelist for any of these products but most of our clients are marketers and their world has been completely transformed by whats possible in our communities its better faster cheaper its a great use of the internet to be able to have continuous connection to customers so that you can get their input and insight whenever you need it if we are doing great work our clients say i have communispace and im powerful so many things are possible some of it is your mindset theres probably a personality type thats attracted to this are you a skeptic do you jump on every new thing im sure somebody has done some personality typing youre going to have to look that up dh right maybe ill find out on twitter because im so powerful laughter thanks for your time diane im sorry we didnt get to talk about the red sox dh my favorite subject next time—along with more dirt about tom peters wearing makeup my

of communispace corp in watertown diane hessan has a list saved in a file on her computer the document serves as a reminder of all the things hessan wants to do in her life already checked off write a book become a ceo and visit the set of the television show  enlarge diane hessan president and ceo of communispace corp in watertown the goal of conducting the boston philharmonic had been gathering electronic dust for  years and when she finally got the chance to conduct a dress rehearsal on april  hessan jumped three minutes into the performance she was stopped by conductor benjamin zander he said to me diane take off your glasses if you read your way through this youre not having enough fun  said hessan  i thought it was so great because really if youre not having fun whats the point so i started again from the beginning and ben held my glasses and i went wild pure heart is what shes about said zander she conducted the orchestra from such passion and warmth and enthusiasm the orchestra players were enchanted she did an uplifting and exuberant performance as if her life depended on it hessans desire for different experiences is what led her to her current role as president and ceo of communispace corp in watertown when hessan joined the nascent company in  she had no experience running an internet business i just had a bee in my bonnet that i wanted to run a technology company said hessan so now shes running one of the areas hottest tech companies hessan expects the company to nearly double it revenue this year to  million from last years  million  and the watertownbased company is hiring at a clip of about three new employees a week funded with 6 million in venture capital communispace has found a niche in the rapidly growing area that can only loosely be defined as online customer service the startup provides software that sets up online customer communities for large corporations including hallmark cards inc unilever plc and colgatepalmolive co to help them plumb the minds of consumers on everything from new products to advertising slogans growing up in norristown pa hessan got her first taste of business by watching her father run his sewing machine repair business her family struggled to get by and hessan never went on vacation or to camp but she took advantage of every school activity serving as president of her class playing the flute and the bassoon and being on the field hockey and lacrosse teams i wasnt an extraordinary athlete but i was a good leader said hessan i just liked rallying people while hessan attended tufts university the economics major realized that if she wanted to meet her goal of attending harvard business school right after college money was going to be tight she raced to finish her undergraduate degree in three years wrote her hbs application in calligraphy and got accepted to the school when she was  after graduation hessan decided she loved marketing and moved to white plains ny to work at general foods as a brand and product manager two years later hessan moved back to boston to take a job at gillette hessan went to meet the category manager before she was set to start the two hit it off right away at the end of the meeting he said to me what trepidations do you have about taking this job  said hessan i said none other than the usual in consumer packaged goods  marketing soft  dri deodorant isnt exactly the peace corps  the gillette manager didnt take the joke well and withdrew the job offer hessan was shattered it was a turning point for me because although i realized i didnt need to be in the peace corps i did need to feel like i was making a difference said hessan hessan took a job at resource planning associates as a consultant after three years she moved to sales training company the forum corp in boston where she stayed for  years doing sales training leadership training and customer service training eventually she became executive vice president and managed  people in  hessan had a selfdescribed midlife crisis she went to a career coach and thats where the lifegoals list began i learned that i couldnt rely just on my job and my family to give me that sense of growth and inspiration and adventure that i wanted in my life said hessan its funny but that list changed everything around when i had the list i had the sense that there was a lot still that i needed to accomplish and that wasnt done it became my inspiration in  hessan wrote the book customer centered growth with her colleague richard whitely and in  she left forum after a year of consulting hessan joined communispace which originally focused on building internal communities at companies to improve collaboration hessan soon discovered the business was flawed because it was hard to get people to use the software competition was brutal  and when the economy tanked harnessing an organizations collective wisdom was not a exactly top priority for most companies the businesschanging moment came when client tom brailsford at hallmark told hessan he was worried his store managers werent going to use the communispace software because hallmark was about to launch a new internal community i took a deep breath and said im really worried theyre not going to use it either  said hessan brailsford suggested hessan put customers inside the community rather than employees hessan loved the idea oversaw development of the product and the hallmark customer community took off communispaces board of directors signed off on the strategy switch and continued to fund the company through a rough period in  today communispace has about 7 clients who each pay on average  a month for each community shes assembled a great team said brailsford who still works with communispace shes a very personable downtoearth leader when shes not at work hessan spends time with her two daughters she also continually adds to her list a huge baseball fan who owns a large collection of signed baseballs  including a favorite signed by both mookie wilson and bill buckner the new york mets hero and boston red sox goat of the 6 world series  hessan has added to her list the goal of visiting every

ways to get them to open up about very personal thoughts and feelings by diane hessan diane hessan is the chairman of communispace a consumer collaboration agency she helped found in  to date it has launched more than  communities and in  was rated the fastestgrowing company in its industry diane is coauthor of customercentered growth five proven strategies for building competitive advantage dianehessan president and ceo of communispacedianehessan write a comment credit secrets and insecurities we all have them yet most of us only discuss them with a trusted confidant like a best friend or spouse or behind a veil of anonymity such as in a blog post comment or discussion board but disclosing them to a brand in an open forum thats scary stuff for more than a decade thats precisely what men and women have done in private online communitieseven with highly sensitive topics such as handling personal bankruptcy having difficulty making ends meet coping with a serious disease or even struggling with something embarrassing in one community that my company communispace built and managed for a leading personal care brand it was critical to create a safe environment in which people could reveal personal thoughts and experiences recently one member suggested that our community facilitators go a full day wearing adult diapers to fully empathize with what its like living with incontinence our intrepid team was up for the challenge and spent the day commuting working and socializing wearing the undergarments the next day the tables in the community turned as members became the facilitators asking our team questions about how their day had gone the exercise was profoundly eyeopening and members questions revealed genuine candid truths around how it feels to be an incontinent adult and allowed the brand to fully understand their needs lets face it incontinence is as personal as it gets so how can brands successfully get closer to their customers to create products or services that truly address their needs from working with hundreds of consumers every day heres what weve learned about getting them to open up and share some of the most intimate details of their lives  build trust by being yourself a trusting open honest and respectful relationshipbe it with a loved one a friend or a customeris a twoway street for brands its the road best traveled to reveal often unexpected consumerinspired aha moments that fuel innovation and new approaches to business for example uk telecom giant everything everywhere ee invited a small group of consumers to a collaborative workshop where everyone was encouraged to share oh no moments when they lost or damaged their mobile phone these honest accounts revealed that it was the data inside the phone not the phone itself that was most precious as a result ee created the clone phone a service that will replace a lost or damaged phone quickly with all personal data intact but people will never be willing to divulge their innermost thoughts and feelings without a safe secure environment and a trusted partner that is along for the entire journey to elicit meaningful revelations brands have to be willing to engage in a twoway conversation with consumers to get closer and dig deeper i share my own real struggles says david ricaud senior consultant and a team storytelling lead at communispace health the result people see me not as a facilitator but rather as a trusted equal who like them has problems my members appreciate knowing the real meeverything from my cats name to my romantic experiences to the ways my friends drive me crazy my openness helps them open up  step aside and let them build meaningful relationships when a woman in one of our communities tragically lost her husband she turned to others in the group to help her cope with her loss in another community one woman traveled across the country to meet up with other members to socialize and share stories in person there are even memberarranged trips including one group that worked on a habitat for humanity project such strong bondsformed digitally and in personnot only enrich peoples lives but for brands also yield insightful and unintended consequences stepping aside and letting consumer relationships evolve organically over time gives brands a unique window into the whos whats whys and hows of their customers and shows where the brand can be of most value and create the most impact in communities dealing with very personal topics like money and health its the longstanding membertomember relationships that often reveal peoples struggles frustrations and deepseated worries just by listening to people talking and bonding with one another companies in financial services health care and other industries can tailor products and services to better serve their customers and create messaging that resonates with customers reallife situations  treat them as partners not respondents people in our communities want to be engaged as strategic partners and brand consultants not passive purchaser x or bucketed consumer y each brings their particular perspective and opinions and youd be astounded at just how deep and how far theyre willing to go to be heard raela ripaldi vice president of client services at communispace told me about skip a member of a food brand community skip really embraced the community and was the epitome of an übermember he would start a ton of activities and would jump in and facilitate she says at one point he actually analyzed his results and sent us his own report it was great and the client loved his passion whether its skip a firsttime mom who documents every step of her pregnancy through her newborns first year a teenager who films his own soda commercial or a woman who releases her inner don draper and inspires elements of an actual ad campaign some of the best and brightest insights come from our community members theyre the ones who often do and ask the things brands themselves would never think of brands have an opportunity to create amazing innovations with the help of consumersthings that can change lives shift opinions and make the world a better place empathy is at the core it all starts by encouraging openness and honesty creating safe places to connect allowing peoples unique voices to be heard and yes sometimes even trying on an adult
