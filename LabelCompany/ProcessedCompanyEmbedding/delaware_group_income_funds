heaviest inflows accruing to intermediateterm funds on the economic front survey results continued to appear stronger than the hard data first quarter gross domestic product gdp was reported at only  threemonth average payroll growth fell from  to  and consumer inflation eased for three consecutive months however the fomc viewed the apparent slowing of economic activity as transitory with minutes of its may meeting suggesting a june rate hike the us federal reserve’s reinvestment of its treasurys agencybacked securities abs and mortgagebacked securities mbs are expected to be tapered over time illinois general obligation bonds were downgraded by standard  poor’s from bbb to bbb and moody’s investors service from baa to baa due to the state’s twoyear budget standoff the downgrade caused yields to widen though illinois bonds still managed a  gain for the quarter elsewhere an oversight board created by the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act promesa used title iii bankruptcylike provisions to address years of weak economic performance that caused puerto rico to default on the majority of its debt a federal judge was appointed to resolve conflicts between creditors pensioners and the commonwealth puerto rico bonds returned  for the second quarter and  year to date importantly however both illinois and puerto rico were isolated rather than systemic issues within the municipal market within the fund contributing to performance was the fund’s exposure to longterm bonds plus years which was the strongestperforming maturity segment within the benchmark the bloomberg barclays municipal bond index returning  despite the fund’s modestly lower return of  in the long bond segment a percentagepoint overweight resulted in a positive relative contribution additionally a  outofbenchmark position in belowinvestmentgrade bonds contributed to performance by returning  versus the benchmark return of  while the bloomberg barclays highyield municipal bond index returned  meanwhile the fund’s exposure in the year segment  years was a modest detractor returning  versus the benchmark’s year segment return of  the underperformance could be attributed to a duration that was  years shorter than the benchmark in the year segment however the fund’s percentagepoint overweight helped offset a portion of the underperformance outlook as we enter the third quarter of  the market consensus is for the fomc to raise the federal funds rate one more time in  and to begin tapering the fed’s balance sheet positions in treasurys and mortgages those moves are largely expected to occur at the fed’s september and december meetings although the sequence could depend on incoming data over the summer months while the fomc has signaled its desire to normalize the federal funds rate sooner rather than later we believe the recent easing in inflation may cause policy makers to pause rate hikes in september thus allowing more time to gather economic data points the trajectory of rate increases is important since it not only signals the direction of rates but also the slope of the yield curve a pause may cause the curve to steepen while continued tightening should result in additional flattening of the curve we believe the slowing in inflation and the recent weakness in nonfarm payrolls are signs that the economy continues to muddle along annual economic growth of about  has been the operative number over the past few years and we do not foresee a significant change therefore we think the fomc may continue to raise the federal funds rate slowly with longterm yields remaining rangebound if long rates stay in a range and short rates rise only slowly we expect the yield curve should continue to flatten and spread product — such as our portfolio overweights to arated bbbrated and belowinvestmentgrade securities — should continue to provide excess return this document may mention bond ratings published by nationally
