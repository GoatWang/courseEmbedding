incdec  about landauer inc ldr maudes capital special situations eventdriven arbitrage longshort equitymaudes capitalsummarygilead capital lp is an asset management firm based in new york city it holds  stake in landauer incgilead capital lp sent a letter to the board of directors of landauer claiming that the exexecutive chairman michael leatherman should step down from the board of directorsi believe that the company is not using its resources in a befitting manner and it should start cutting expenses merge or restructureintroduction landauer inc nyseldr landauer was recently targeted by the activist fund gilead capital lp the fund sent a letter to the board of directors of the company claiming that the returns of the company were poor and the exexecutive chairman lies about his skills he does not have a cpa license he is still in the board of directors you can read the letter at the end of the article landauer inc landauer provides radiation safety products and services it has been around for  years and works for different industries hospitals medical and dental offices university and national laboratories nuclear power plants and other industries in which radiation poses a potential threat to employees  company website the risk of this business is quite low given that the company works for different clients my opinion about the letter i believe that the fact that the executive chairman does not own the cpa license is not a big deal the following information is taken from one of the activist sec filings on october   gilead capital held another teleconference with messrs leatherman and kaminski on which gilead capital inquired about mr leathermans status as a certified public accountant cpa while the company had repeatedly stated in its regulatory filings and press statements that mr leatherman was a cpa gilead capital had been unable to verify this information through a public records search mr leatherman acknowledged that he did not have a cpa license but defended his actions by stating that he did not see why it mattered he also offered to set up a meeting with william dempsey the lead independent director and a member of the governance and nominating committee about gilead capitals board seat request  sec filing it has damaged the image of the board of directors fair enough but i am not going to support the activist just for this reason i believe that the activist is right while pointing out that the company is not well governed but it is not only that instead of reducing its expenses the company is using debt now because the business does not work like a few years ago if you take a look at the following graph you can see that the revenue stopped growing four years ago the stock chart reacted to this fact ldr data by ycharts the board did not work well after this new environment instead of adjusting the expenses of the company it issued a lot of debt in addition the company has been holding cash in the balance sheet ldr data by ycharts i believe the real problem of the board is that it is not making good use of its resources i can imagine that the company is looking for targets to buy at this point in time this is a very good idea but it has to be implemented immediately if the board does not show that it is really working for solutions of the current situation then other activist may buy the company and change the board my take to sum up landauer used to grow because of its business but it not doing it right now the board should recognize that the company is entering into a mature phase and must act quickly if it decides to grow with mergers it should start immediately i believe that it is the right time to buy this stock since the activist will push the company to merge or restructure the stock price will rise again when this happens the letter board of directors landauer inc science roadglenwood il  dear members of the board of directors gilead capital lp gilead we or us currently holds approximately  of the common stock of landauer inc the company or landauer over the past  months of engagement with the company we have made clear to you our leadership investing strategy to find and invest in durable highquality businesses underachieving their potential due to shortfalls in governance or leadership and where the need and opportunity merit play an active and constructive role in helping them reach their full potential we have invested in and engaged with landauer to help remedy this boards longstanding failures  a number of which are described herein  which we believe are responsible for the stocks longterm underperformance and could endanger the realization of the longterm opportunities available to its exceptional radiation measurement business we write to you publicly only after constructively and patiently encouraging you over the past several months to follow landauers codes of ethics and to address what we see as the boards major governance shortfalls we had hoped to avoid the need to discuss this publicly and gave you numerous opportunities to deal with our concerns and consider our proposals privately and in accordance with your policies and procedures you have instead demanded that we trust this board with the company in spite of its track record of failures as described below that you do so while failing to adhere to your codes and to what we view as the most basic tenets of good governance has forced our hand and only made it more apparent to us how deeply entrenched these problems are and how urgently change is needed the board has failed to address the executive chairmans legal and ethical violations we must first address the elephant in the room executive chairman michael leatherman gilead has zero tolerance for illegal or unethical behavior and applies the same standard to those who represent us as directors we thus feel obligated to speak up when we discover that our representatives are failing to uphold that standard on october   we asked mr leatherman about the discrepancy between our public records search and landauers repeated statements over the past eight years that mr leatherman is a certified public accountant cpa mr leatherman conceded that he does not have a cpa license but brazenly dismissed our inquiry asserting that he did not see why in the world it matters make no mistake  it matters it matters for shareholders and regulators who expect the company to abide by state and federal law by falsely holding himself out as a cpa mr leatherman violated illinois state law by knowingly certifying this falsehood in landauers regulatory filings during his time as ceo and interim cfo mr leatherman repeatedly violated  and caused the company to violate  federal securities law it matters for landauers honest and hardworking employees who abide by the same rules mr leatherman and the board have broken by misrepresenting his professional credentials mr leatherman violated landauers code of business conduct and ethics and its code of ethics for financial executives and by not notifying shareholders promptly once the board became aware of these breaches you too are violating both codes it matters for the culture and character of the landauer organization by inexcusably refusing to take responsibility for his violations mr leatherman is flouting the companys standards thereby undermining its collective integrity and by sitting idly by while he does so the board is sending a message to all employees that a different set of rules applies at the top we have repeatedly urged you to carry out your most basic duties by holding mr leatherman to account and communicating promptly and transparently to your shareholders on october  we voiced our worries about mr leatherman to ceo michael kaminski who was on the october  call and tried to arrange a meeting with lead independent director bill dempsey on november  we wrote a letter to the entire board that among other things highlighted mr leathermans violations and expressed our grave concern that his position and tenure have compromised the boards ability to act independently on november  when we spoke with messrs dempsey and kaminski and asked for a response to our letter they replied with only vague assurances that the board would respond in its own time on november  deeply dissatisfied that you had not acted on the information about mr leatherman for nearly three weeks and convinced that he stands in the way of accountability and progress in the boardroom we demanded that you act to remove mr leatherman from the board and the company by november  that this deadline has passed in silence speaks volumes about the need for immediate change landauers longstanding governance problems and poor performance we believe that a board that refuses to govern itself is a board that is unfit to govern the company indeed this boards public inaction in response to the clearcut violations detailed above is just the latest symptom of its longstanding lack of fitness to govern landauer over the past decade the board has overseen a series of strategic and operational errors that have cost shareholders hundreds of millions of dollars and untold millions in foregone opportunities project comet  the board approved and monitored the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system apparently failing to appreciate the complexity of the project as evidenced by the ballooning of the initial  million budget and month timeline to  million and seven years izi medical products acquisition  after the board decided to pursue and incentivize a growthbyacquisition strategy it authorized a  million acquisition of a medical products business that lacked obvious synergies with the core radiation measurement business shortly after the acquisition the business collapsed due to the loss of a key customer and was finally sold earlier in  at more than an  percent loss accounting restatement  remediation  landauer restated or revised four years of financial statements including those produced during mr leathermans tenure as interim cfo and as a member of the audit committee due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that resulted in a wide range of accounting errors the companys investigation cited the failures to maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge of accounting and consistently establish appropriate authorities and responsibilities nextgeneration wireless dosimetry present though landauer has publicly discussed its plans to develop and launch wireless dosimetry technology since  its primary competitor mirion was the first to market with a commercially available wireless dosimeter landauers asofyet unreleased product verifii remains an unfulfilled promise we believe these problems have taken a huge toll on landauers financial health since  when mr leatherman mr dempsey and david meador joined the board landauers adjusted operating margins have plummeted from nearly  percent to below  percent and its balance sheet has been turned upsidedown going from a net cash position of  million in  to a net debt position of  million as of june   sec filing for longterm shareholders landauers deteriorating financial health has been devastating in  the board reduced the quarterly dividend payment for the first time in landauers nearly year history as a publiclylisted company cutting it by  percent since  landauers total shareholder returns have drastically underperformed returning  versus  for the proxy peer group  for the russell  health care index and  for the russell  indeed the history of returns speaks directly to the track record of landauers board sec filing while there has been significant and seemingly disruptive turnover in the executive ranks every director who oversaw this extended underperformance and the series of disastrous decisions continues to serve on the board as this apparent unwillingness to take accountability amply demonstrates the fundamental governance problems that we believe are responsible for the aforementioned failures of strategy capital allocation risk control and succession planning remain unaddressed as evidenced by the fact that the board lacks a single member with the healthcare data analytics and it experience needed to guide verifii critical technical and strategic skill gaps persist on the board hampering its ability to evaluate decisions that will shape the companys future the potential value of and the financial goals attached to the companys longterm strategy have been opaque to shareholders and the specific incentives tied to those strategies have not been disclosed the directors who oversaw the capital allocation and risk assessments that evidently failed over the past eight years largely remain in charge of those processes today we had assumed you would be chastened by the companys performance under your watch and be eager to hear our suggestions for improvement instead when we expressed concern on our november  call about the implications of this boards longterm track record for the companys future mr dempsey claimed to be perplexed approvingly citing the stocks recent bounce off levels last seen in  to us this is not good governance it is whistling past the graveyard seizing the opportunity to reinvigorate landauer we believe landauer is at a crossroads with upgrades in board composition and skills a clear and transparent longterm strategy strategicallyaligned incentives rigorous capital allocation and financing policies and improved investor relations we believe the company could reach its full potential and capitalize on the numerous strategic technological and operational opportunities available to it  most importantly verifii allow the board to remain complacent and reactive and not only could these opportunities be squandered but in our view the company could permanently cede its technological and operational leadership in its core business and irreparably impair shareholder value on october   we met with mr leatherman and mr kaminski and shared with the board this diagnosis and our prescriptions including fostering an ownership culture through direct shareholder representation on the board during our conversation mr leatherman acknowledged some though far from all of the boards shortcomings and complimented our knowledge of the company as parallel to that of the board yet in our subsequent communications the board has denied the need for outside assistance insisting we leave landauers future in its hands mr leatherman and this board have urged us to trust them with the company as if we have forgotten whose judgment led it to this point you have not held yourselves accountable you have spurned our offers to help you have not been clear and transparent with your shareholders it seems you cannot even be bothered to comply with the law and your own policies before the substantive work of reinvigorating landauer can begin the board must part ways with the people and practices that have wrought so much damage we therefore demand that the board immediately take the following actions  remove mr leatherman as a director and officer of the company  reveal publicly the nomination and review processes for mr leatherman and mr dempsey both of whom came to the board in  through company contacts in the business community  form a committee of independent directors excluding robert cronin and stephen mitchell both of whom served on the governance and nominating committee in  to investigate and strengthen the independence rigor and timeliness of the nomination and review processes  appoint our managing partner jeffrey strong to the board to participate on the independent committee and begin remedying the governance shortfalls we have identified as our repeated attempts to engage privately with you show we are eager to work collaboratively to address the aforementioned governance deficiencies and build a better future for landauers shareholders employees and customers however should the board remain silent or choose to paper over the real problems it faces we will act to protect shareholder value we are prepared to propose a slate of directors at the companys annual meeting if necessary but we would strongly prefer to spend our time reinvigorating landauer rather than rehashing in even greater detail the clearcut case for change  a public records
