including ogden cap plsg accelerator fund tech coast angels ace fund ariel southeast angel partners and minvest partners also participated in the financing this latest round of financing is indicative of the growing commitment we are seeing from investors to find new and effective treatments for alzheimers disease said dr hank safferstein chief executive officer we are emboldened by the recent scientific validation of the soluble abeta oligomer binding target and the promise that our small molecule abeta oligomer displacement approach could significantly improve the lives of patients and their families cogrx will focus on advancing its firstinclass lead alzheimers program into phase  clinical studies by the end of  the companys small molecule abeta oligomer displacement drug has the potential to rapidly improve and possibly reverse the symptoms of alzheimers disease and to stop disease progression in addition the company is using the funds to advance next generation compounds and unlock the potential of its platform for discovering drugs for other protein misfolding nervous system diseases  cogrx also announced two additions to its medical advisory board dr steven t dekosky md aertscosper professor of alzheimers research deputy director mcknight brain institute and dr lon s schneider md professor of psychiatry neurology and gerontology keck school of medicine of usc these experts will bring their extensive experience in alzheimers research to help guide the development of cogrxs clinical trial program i am honored to be a part of this rapidly unfolding and exciting story said dr steven dekosky  the field has been searching for truly novel therapeutic approaches to treating and preventing alzheimers disease cogrxs oligomer antagonist drug candidate is the first opportunity we have to test this modified amyloid hypothesis which has been recently strengthened by the public disclosures from two large biopharmaceutical companies i believe the cogrx drug candidate has the potential to not only improve cognitive function but to affect the course of disease through synaptic protection  alzheimers is the sixth leading cause of death in the united states and has an economic burden of  billion annually by  the number of people  and older with alzheimers is expected to nearly triple to a projected  million barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent slow or stop the disease these facts and figures combined with the lack of any approved drugs that can slow or halt disease progression make alzheimers disease one of the most significant unmet medical needs of the present decade small molecule drugs that can significantly block and disrupt the binding and pathogenic signaling of the toxic forms of abeta protein have the potential to dramatically improve the quality of life for alzheimers patients and their caregivers   about cogrxs small molecule soluble abeta receptor antagonist programcogrx has discovered small
