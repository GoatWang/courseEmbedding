when it comes to legacy applications they have several hundred or thousands of applications running in what was once a modern approachdescription contentencodedcdatapemthis blog post was authored by shawn gibbs senior program manager wssc emppive recently been working with many customers who find themselves at a crossroads when it comes to legacy applications they have several hundred or thousands of applications running in what was once a modern approach but in todays world lack the ability to gain all the benefits available in modern architectures in the customer engagements ive been working on im starting to see paradigms like with any journey it is important to understand the destination before you set off the destination may be a serverless microservices pattern in which applications are architected to offer the greatest flexibility in scale and repeatability at high speed the goal in a modern approach is to be able to iterate against the components without impacting all the services that depend on them but allow for new business functionality at a rapid pace while increasing the ability scale easily once we have a destination we need to map the possibilities and process required to achieve shortterm objectives that gain some of the benefits of the more modern approach moving to a devops approach is necessary in order to take full advantage of the benefitsppthe basic steps i find work well for customers are  document the destination  map the journey and find low hanging fruit  validate the different stops in the journey  take the first stepphdocument the destinationhpthe final destination or architecture doesnt need to be complete or an indepth architecture but there are some very basic questions to answers first its necessary to determine what youd like to use as a starting point is windows server  with a container service enough to get you started is your project more elaborate in nature and would benefit from using a platform as a service a starting point is to consider your depth of capabilities and design a pattern that will utilize this knowledge base for example your operations team may be focused and excellent at managing linux and your development team may be made up of primarily net developers we then look at modern application patterns like a targetblank hrefhttpsazuremicrosoftcomenusblogmicroservicesanapplicationrevolutionpoweredbythecloudcdndisable relnoopener noreferrermicroservicesa and a targetblank hrefhttpsazuremicrosoftcomenusservicesfunctions relnoopener noreferrerserverlessa development and decide how and if the applications should be architected in this way as part of this design and implementation exercise some packaging and deployment options will be required and a targetblank hrefhttpsdocsmicrosoftcomenusvirtualizationwindowscontainersabout relnoopener noreferrercontainersa may be a fit for the microservices we will develop and allow us the ability to increase scale and agility of our continuous integration and deployment process there are other considerations to look at like the actual tooling that will be used and if other solutions like messaging or documents storage make sensephmap the journey and find low hanging fruithpthese early low hanging fruit can be greater scaling capabilities faster deployments and guaranteed consistency between devtest and production environments we find that customers are not always looking to rewrite existing applications and that the organizations priority before starting to build new applications is to gain some of the benefits of newer design models in legacy applications while it can be easier to start from scratch with a new architecture its sometimes not cost effective or not an option and requires you to start with your existing applications and rearchitect them to a more efficient architecture once the destination is mostly mapped out we need to get the delta from where we are today and where we would need to be to gain the greatest amount of benefits from a modern application pattern as the delta list begins to take shape there is now a requirement to rewrite the code base due to things like breaking out individual services and supporting the net core framework development if this is a journey and we consider the stops along the journey as the incremental steps we can take to modernize we may see that we can gain certain benefits from lifting and shifting the application to a more portable and repeatable architecture in this case we may port to a container and deploy as is in a container orchestration cluster which now allows the app to be deployed quickly and easily along with scaling automatically using the orchestrator we will also evaluate the merits of leveraging paas services for portions of the application and these can be delivered from microsoft azure directly or from azure stack onpremisesphvalidate the different stops in the journeyhpthis is typically where we can perform a series of proofs that test the ability to containerize the application as is as well as a targetblank hrefhttpsmarketplacevisualstudiocomitemsitemnameconnieyaunetportabilityanalyzer relnoopener noreferreranalyze the portabilitya of our existing code base to net core  in some cases we may find a monolithic application with its own internal apis can be converted to a microservices architecture easily for example we may have a web front end that talks to a few apis that are part of the same codebase deployed as a single application running in a web server we may deploy the same code base to a number of containers and mark each container as the entry point for the individual apis and front end in this phase there can be a fine tuning of tools and processes that will be required for the destination but more importantly ones that can be used at individual stops along the way the goal would be not to use an interim set of tooling for these middle phases of the journey that doesnt translate into the end result which could be costly and not required its also important to understand that microservices architecture andor containers is not for everything in some conversations ive been asked how do i back up my container a sign that organizations havent quite caught up with the new way of doing thingsphtake the first stephpthis is where the project will realize some of the benefits mapped out in our journey in most cases the journey includes a lift and shift of an existing code base into a more modern model which was tested in earlier stages in some cases these may be the final destination for example a containerized microservices architecture where only the code base and type of containers may change as part of the journey you can formalize the final cicd process to maximize the benefits afforded by either containerizing code refactoring or bothppthe changes in app patterns and the rise of containers is the kind of paradigm shift that happens every decade or so this is definitely a big shift for the industry but it holds a lot of potential benefits for organizations to move faster and respond better to a changing competitive landscape after having worked directly with dozens of organizations on these very changes im a firm believer in whats possible with this new technology and id encourage you to find an app in your portfolio and get started with the process todaypcontentencoded

biggest challenge is getting more bang for the buck between maximizing development and operational capabilities with existing resources maintaining or reducing costs and preserving data security making decisions about it can feel like being stuck between a rock and a couple of hard placesppalthough more organizations are adopting hybrid deployments as one answer to the problem theyre seen as a temporary solution when we asked it professionals and business decision makers why we found the main impediment to be lack of a common frame of reference for hybrid capabilitiespplets unpack that it needs to emmaximize existing resourcesem making them more flexible and scalable and improving performance for both machines and employees it needs to do all of it emas cheaply and safely as possibleem optimizing costs and maintaining endtoend security a hybrid cloud deployment delivers on these requirements in five key waysppstronggreater flexibility stronghybrid cloud deployments allow all sizes of enterprise to extend existing infrastructure to the cloud without massive capital investment the capability to run multiple environments seamlessly gives it the means to support devops more efficientlyppstrongfaster scalabilitystrong a consistent hybrid cloud infrastructure lets you burst resources fast and reliably scale them down again use your onpremises resources to host ip and sensitive data while extending cpuintensive activity to the cloudppstrongincreased performancestrong a consistent hybrid deployment means greater uptime and reliability as well as increased capacity in addition to efficient burst capability a wellimplemented hybrid reduces latency across network resourcesppstrongreal costefficiencystrong hybrid cloud deployments are both cheaper to operate and more robust than nonhybrid solutions the cloud side takes on maintenance and load balancing making it easier to predict setup costs and total cost of ownership it can allocate staff with more precision and reduce capital expenditures overallppstrongconsistent securitystrong cloud security is proving to be more robust than traditional firewalls because of the way hybrid cloud allocates resources across environments you can maintain burst capability while protecting sensitive data apps and intellectual property in the datacenter single signon helps your users be productiveno matter which apps or devices theyre usingwhile protecting corporate informationppa true hybrid deployment includes onpremises resources working in seamless integration with cloud resources to scale workloads

semiannual channel and have shared more information in their blog todayphnano server and containers no such thing as too smallhplast month at a hrefhttpsblogstechnetmicrosoftcomhybridcloudwindowsserverfordevelopersnewsfrommicrosoftbuildmicrosoft builda we announced a number of great developer and container related innovations that will be coming as part of this upcoming feature update including a new version of nano server since our first release of nano server last year weve spent a lot of time with customers to understand how theyre using nano server and where they want to see future investments two things were very clearpolliusing nano server for containers is their highest priorityliliwhen it comes to containers smaller is betterliolpbased on that feedback we are making an important change to nano server this next release will focus on making nano server the very best container image possible from these changes customers will now see the nano server images shrink in size by more than  percent further decreasing startup times and improving container density as part of this effort to focus on containers we will be removing the functionality for infrastructurerelated roles instead of using nano server for these scenarios we recommend deploying the server core installation option which includes all the roles and features you would need these changes to nano server combined with the new application innovations in net core  which enables customers to use more of their code in more places make nano server the best option for new containerbased developmentppin addition to these nano server investments were also delivering application innovations to support linux containers and workloads natively on windows server were extending the hyperv isolation capability introduced with the  release to linux containers as well so now you can run linux containers on windows server this means customers will no longer have to deploy two separate container infrastructures to support both their windows and linuxbased applications were also bringing the windows subsystem for linux wsl commonly known as bash on windows to windows server this unique combination allows developer and application administrators to use the same scripts tools procedures and container images they have been using for linux containers on their windows server container hostphserver core also coming to the semiannual channelhpi am also pleased to announce that server core will now be included in the semiannual channel server core is a headless installation option of the operating system which includes all the roles and features needed to run datacenter servers and containerized traditional applicationsppmoving forward server core will be the recommended choice for hosting your virtual machines as well as your containers which can be running a nano server container image a server core container image or even linux container images this makes server core the ideal platform to support the very popular liftandshift scenario of moving legacy applications to containerized deployments often running in azure for increased performance and manageability with reduced costsppserver core is also our recommended option for infrastructure workloads many customers dont realize that server core is the base image that runs azure and azure stack this means the investments we make in windows server for azure can be made available to customers to use in their own datacenters this makes server core a great choice for azure customers who like the idea of consistent technologies between their datacenter and the cloud one example of this in the upcoming feature update is the cluster sets functionality for increased scale of hyperconverged deployments were also continuing to add security investments such as the ability to quickly encrypt network segments on their softwaredefined networking infrastructure per their security and compliance needs you can expect new features to continue to optimize efficiency performance and security for softwaredefined datacentersphaccessing windows server in the semiannual

when it comes to legacy applications they have several hundred or thousands of applications running in what was once a modern approachdescription contentencodedcdatapemthis blog post was authored by shawn gibbs senior program manager wssc emppive recently been working with many customers who find themselves at a crossroads when it comes to legacy applications they have several hundred or thousands of applications running in what was once a modern approach but in todays world lack the ability to gain all the benefits available in modern architectures in the customer engagements ive been working on im starting to see paradigms like with any journey it is important to understand the destination before you set off the destination may be a serverless microservices pattern in which applications are architected to offer the greatest flexibility in scale and repeatability at high speed the goal in a modern approach is to be able to iterate against the components without impacting all the services that depend on them but allow for new business functionality at a rapid pace while increasing the ability scale easily once we have a destination we need to map the possibilities and process required to achieve shortterm objectives that gain some of the benefits of the more modern approach moving to a devops approach is necessary in order to take full advantage of the benefitsppthe basic steps i find work well for customers are  document the destination  map the journey and find low hanging fruit  validate the different stops in the journey  take the first stepphdocument the destinationhpthe final destination or architecture doesnt need to be complete or an indepth architecture but there are some very basic questions to answers first its necessary to determine what youd like to use as a starting point is windows server  with a container service enough to get you started is your project more elaborate in nature and would benefit from using a platform as a service a starting point is to consider your depth of capabilities and design a pattern that will utilize this knowledge base for example your operations team may be focused and excellent at managing linux and your development team may be made up of primarily net developers we then look at modern application patterns like a targetblank hrefhttpsazuremicrosoftcomenusblogmicroservicesanapplicationrevolutionpoweredbythecloudcdndisable relnoopener noreferrermicroservicesa and a targetblank hrefhttpsazuremicrosoftcomenusservicesfunctions relnoopener noreferrerserverlessa development and decide how and if the applications should be architected in this way as part of this design and implementation exercise some packaging and deployment options will be required and a targetblank hrefhttpsdocsmicrosoftcomenusvirtualizationwindowscontainersabout relnoopener noreferrercontainersa may be a fit for the microservices we will develop and allow us the ability to increase scale and agility of our continuous integration and deployment process there are other considerations to look at like the actual tooling that will be used and if other solutions like messaging or documents storage make sensephmap the journey and find low hanging fruithpthese early low hanging fruit can be greater scaling capabilities faster deployments and guaranteed consistency between devtest and production environments we find that customers are not always looking to rewrite existing applications and that the organizations priority before starting to build new applications is to gain some of the benefits of newer design models in legacy applications while it can be easier to start from scratch with a new architecture its sometimes not cost effective or not an option and requires you to start with your existing applications and rearchitect them to a more efficient architecture once the destination is mostly mapped out we need to get the delta from where we are today and where we would need to be to gain the greatest amount of benefits from a modern application pattern as the delta list begins to take shape there is now a requirement to rewrite the code base due to things like breaking out individual services and supporting the net core framework development if this is a journey and we consider the stops along the journey as the incremental steps we can take to modernize we may see that we can gain certain benefits from lifting and shifting the application to a more portable and repeatable architecture in this case we may port to a container and deploy as is in a container orchestration cluster which now allows the app to be deployed quickly and easily along with scaling automatically using the orchestrator we will also evaluate the merits of leveraging paas services for portions of the application and these can be delivered from microsoft azure directly or from azure stack onpremisesphvalidate the different stops in the journeyhpthis is typically where we can perform a series of proofs that test the ability to containerize the application as is as well as a targetblank hrefhttpsmarketplacevisualstudiocomitemsitemnameconnieyaunetportabilityanalyzer relnoopener noreferreranalyze the portabilitya of our existing code base to net core  in some cases we may find a monolithic application with its own internal apis can be converted to a microservices architecture easily for example we may have a web front end that talks to a few apis that are part of the same codebase deployed as a single application running in a web server we may deploy the same code base to a number of containers and mark each container as the entry point for the individual apis and front end in this phase there can be a fine tuning of tools and processes that will be required for the destination but more importantly ones that can be used at individual stops along the way the goal would be not to use an interim set of tooling for these middle phases of the journey that doesnt translate into the end result which could be costly and not required its also important to understand that microservices architecture andor containers is not for everything in some conversations ive been asked how do i back up my container a sign that organizations havent quite caught up with the new way of doing thingsphtake the first stephpthis is where the project will realize some of the benefits mapped out in our journey in most cases the journey includes a lift and shift of an existing code base into a more modern model which was tested in earlier stages in some cases these may be the final destination for example a containerized microservices architecture where only the code base and type of containers may change as part of the journey you can formalize the final cicd process to maximize the benefits afforded by either containerizing code refactoring or bothppthe changes in app patterns and the rise of containers is the kind of paradigm shift that happens every decade or so this is definitely a big shift for the industry but it holds a lot of potential benefits for organizations to move faster and respond better to a changing competitive landscape after having worked directly with dozens of organizations on these very changes im a firm believer in whats possible with this new technology and id encourage you to find an app in your portfolio and get started with the process todaypcontentencoded

biggest challenge is getting more bang for the buck between maximizing development and operational capabilities with existing resources maintaining or reducing costs and preserving data security making decisions about it can feel like being stuck between a rock and a couple of hard placesppalthough more organizations are adopting hybrid deployments as one answer to the problem theyre seen as a temporary solution when we asked it professionals and business decision makers why we found the main impediment to be lack of a common frame of reference for hybrid capabilitiespplets unpack that it needs to emmaximize existing resourcesem making them more flexible and scalable and improving performance for both machines and employees it needs to do all of it emas cheaply and safely as possibleem optimizing costs and maintaining endtoend security a hybrid cloud deployment delivers on these requirements in five key waysppstronggreater flexibility stronghybrid cloud deployments allow all sizes of enterprise to extend existing infrastructure to the cloud without massive capital investment the capability to run multiple environments seamlessly gives it the means to support devops more efficientlyppstrongfaster scalabilitystrong a consistent hybrid cloud infrastructure lets you burst resources fast and reliably scale them down again use your onpremises resources to host ip and sensitive data while extending cpuintensive activity to the cloudppstrongincreased performancestrong a consistent hybrid deployment means greater uptime and reliability as well as increased capacity in addition to efficient burst capability a wellimplemented hybrid reduces latency across network resourcesppstrongreal costefficiencystrong hybrid cloud deployments are both cheaper to operate and more robust than nonhybrid solutions the cloud side takes on maintenance and load balancing making it easier to predict setup costs and total cost of ownership it can allocate staff with more precision and reduce capital expenditures overallppstrongconsistent securitystrong cloud security is proving to be more robust than traditional firewalls because of the way hybrid cloud allocates resources across environments you can maintain burst capability while protecting sensitive data apps and intellectual property in the datacenter single signon helps your users be productiveno matter which apps or devices theyre usingwhile protecting corporate informationppa true hybrid deployment includes onpremises resources working in seamless integration with cloud resources to scale workloads efficiently it takes advantage of the robust security in an enterprise cloud to protect data and user identities across environments hybrid isnt just a transitional solution its the deployment that

datacenter needs have really evolved but the one constant is the accelerating pace of change digital transformation is changing the way business is done and the most competitive organizations react quickly to new opportunities which usually involves agile applications it leaders frequently ask me how windows server is evolving to meet this new reality and how they can take advantage of new innovations at the pace their business demandspptoday id like to share more details about our new model of delivering more frequent releases of windows server starting this fall we plan to deliver two feature updates per year each spring and fall aligning to the a hrefhttpssupportofficecomenusarticleoverviewoftheupcomingchangestoofficeproplusupdatemanagementbcdfdcefccauienusamprsenusampaduswindows and office semiannual channel release cyclea this option provides opportunity for customers who are innovating quickly to take advantage of new operating system capabilities at a faster pace both in applications  particularly those built on containers and microservices as well as in the softwaredefined hybrid datacenter a hrefhttpsakamsgdvrltsystem centera will also be participating in the semiannual channel and have shared more information in their blog todayphnano server and containers no such thing as too smallhplast month at a hrefhttpsblogstechnetmicrosoftcomhybridcloudwindowsserverfordevelopersnewsfrommicrosoftbuildmicrosoft builda we announced a number of great developer and container related innovations that will be coming as part of this upcoming feature update including a new version of nano server since our first release of nano server last year weve spent a lot of time with customers to understand how theyre using nano server and where they want to see future investments two things were very clearpolliusing nano server for containers is their highest priorityliliwhen it comes to containers smaller is betterliolpbased on that feedback we are making an important change to nano server this next release will focus on making nano server the very best container image possible from these changes customers will now see the nano server images shrink in size by more than  percent further decreasing startup times and improving container density as part of this effort to focus on containers we will be removing the functionality for infrastructurerelated roles instead of using nano server for these scenarios we recommend deploying the server core installation option which includes all the roles and features you would need these changes to nano server combined with the new application innovations in net core  which enables customers to use more of their code in more places make nano server the best option for new containerbased developmentppin addition to these nano server investments were also delivering application innovations to support linux containers and workloads natively on windows server were extending the hyperv isolation capability introduced with the  release to linux containers as well so now you can run linux containers on windows server this means customers will no longer have to deploy two separate container infrastructures to support both their windows and linuxbased applications were also bringing the windows subsystem for linux wsl commonly known as bash on windows to windows server this unique combination allows developer and application administrators to use the same scripts tools procedures and container images they have been using for linux containers on their windows server container hostphserver core also coming to the semiannual channelhpi am also pleased to announce that server core will now be included in the semiannual channel server core is a headless installation option of the operating system which includes all the roles and features needed to run datacenter servers and containerized traditional applicationsppmoving forward server core will be the recommended choice for hosting your virtual machines as well as your containers which can be running a nano server container image a server core container image or even linux container images this makes server core the ideal platform to support the very popular liftandshift scenario of moving legacy applications to containerized deployments often running in azure for increased performance and manageability with reduced costsppserver core is also our recommended option for infrastructure workloads many customers dont realize that server core is the base image that runs azure and azure stack this means the investments we make in windows server for azure can be made available to customers to use in their own datacenters this makes server core a great choice for azure customers who like the idea of consistent technologies between their datacenter and the cloud one example of this in the upcoming feature update is the cluster sets functionality for increased scale of hyperconverged deployments were also continuing to add security investments such as the ability to quickly encrypt network segments on their softwaredefined networking infrastructure per their security and compliance needs you can expect new features to continue to optimize efficiency performance and security for softwaredefined datacentersphaccessing windows server in the semiannual channelhpthere are two ways to get access to windows server in the semiannual channelpulliwindows server standard or datacenter customers who are covered by software assurance will automatically have access to semiannual channel releases as they are made available servers without software assurance do not have rights to the semiannual channel releaseslilicustomers can also access these new windows

the a hrefhttpsazuremicrosoftcomenuspricinghybridusebenefitvazure hybrid use benefitaliulpwith the release of windows server  we started the process of making our monthly updates cumulative this means

when it comes to legacy applications they have several hundred or thousands of applications running in what was once a modern approachdescription contentencodedcdatapemthis blog post was authored by shawn gibbs senior program manager wssc emppive recently been working with many customers who find themselves at a crossroads when it comes to legacy applications they have several hundred or thousands of applications running in what was once a modern approach but in todays world lack the ability to gain all the benefits available in modern architectures in the customer engagements ive been working on im starting to see paradigms like with any journey it is important to understand the destination before you set off the destination may be a serverless microservices pattern in which applications are architected to offer the greatest flexibility in scale and repeatability at high speed the goal in a modern approach is to be able to iterate against the components without impacting all the services that depend on them but allow for new business functionality at a rapid pace while increasing the ability scale easily once we have a destination we need to map the possibilities and process required to achieve shortterm objectives that gain some of the benefits of the more modern approach moving to a devops approach is necessary in order to take full advantage of the benefitsppthe basic steps i find work well for customers are  document the destination  map the journey and find low hanging fruit  validate the different stops in the journey  take the first stepphdocument the destinationhpthe final destination or architecture doesnt need to be complete or an indepth architecture but there are some very basic questions to answers first its necessary to determine what youd like to use as a starting point is windows server  with a container service enough to get you started is your project more elaborate in nature and would benefit from using a platform as a service a starting point is to consider your depth of capabilities and design a pattern that will utilize this knowledge base for example your operations team may be focused and excellent at managing linux and your development team may be made up of primarily net developers we then look at modern application patterns like a targetblank hrefhttpsazuremicrosoftcomenusblogmicroservicesanapplicationrevolutionpoweredbythecloudcdndisable relnoopener noreferrermicroservicesa and a targetblank hrefhttpsazuremicrosoftcomenusservicesfunctions relnoopener noreferrerserverlessa development and decide how and if the applications should be architected in this way as part of this design and implementation exercise some packaging and deployment options will be required and a targetblank hrefhttpsdocsmicrosoftcomenusvirtualizationwindowscontainersabout relnoopener noreferrercontainersa may be a fit for the microservices we will develop and allow us the ability to increase scale and agility of our continuous integration and deployment process there are other considerations to look at like the actual tooling that will be used and if other solutions like messaging or documents storage make sensephmap the journey and find low hanging fruithpthese early low hanging fruit can be greater scaling capabilities faster deployments and guaranteed consistency between devtest and production environments we find that customers are not always looking to rewrite existing applications and that the organizations priority before starting to build new applications is to gain some of the benefits of newer design models in legacy applications while it can be easier to start from scratch with a new architecture its sometimes not cost effective or not an option and requires you to start with your existing applications and rearchitect them to a more efficient architecture once the destination is mostly mapped out we need to get the delta from where we are today and where we would need to be to gain the greatest amount of benefits from a modern application pattern as the delta list begins to take shape there is now a requirement to rewrite the code base due to things like breaking out individual services and supporting the net core framework development if this is a journey and we consider the stops along the journey as the incremental steps we can take to modernize we may see that we can gain certain benefits from lifting and shifting the application to a more portable and repeatable architecture in this case we may port to a container and deploy as is in a container orchestration cluster which now allows the app to be deployed quickly and easily along with scaling automatically using the orchestrator we will also evaluate the merits of leveraging paas services for portions of the application and these can be delivered from microsoft azure directly or from azure stack onpremisesphvalidate the different stops in the journeyhpthis is typically where we can perform a series of proofs that test the ability to containerize the application as is as well as a targetblank hrefhttpsmarketplacevisualstudiocomitemsitemnameconnieyaunetportabilityanalyzer relnoopener noreferreranalyze the portabilitya of our existing code base to net core  in some cases we may find a monolithic application with its own internal apis can be converted to a microservices architecture easily for example we may have a web front end that talks to a few apis that are part of the same codebase deployed as a single application running in a web server we may deploy the same code base to a number of containers and mark each container as the entry point for the individual apis and front end in this phase there can be a fine tuning of tools and processes that will be required for the destination but more importantly ones that can be used at individual stops along the way the goal would be not to use an interim set of tooling for these middle phases of the journey that doesnt translate into the end result which could be costly and not required its also important to understand that microservices architecture andor containers is not for everything in some conversations ive been asked how do i back up my container a sign that organizations havent quite caught up with the new way of doing thingsphtake the first stephpthis is where the project will realize some of the benefits mapped out in our journey in most cases the journey includes a lift and shift of an existing code base into a more modern model which was tested in earlier stages in some cases these may be the final destination for example a containerized microservices architecture where only the code base and type of containers may change as part of the journey you can formalize the final cicd process to maximize the benefits afforded by either containerizing code refactoring or bothppthe changes in app patterns and the rise of containers is the kind of paradigm shift that happens every decade or so this is definitely a big shift for the industry but it holds a lot of potential benefits for organizations to move faster and respond better to a changing competitive landscape after having worked directly with dozens of organizations on these very changes im a firm believer in whats possible with this new technology and id encourage you to find an app in your portfolio and get started with the process todaypcontentencoded

biggest challenge is getting more bang for the buck between maximizing development and operational capabilities with existing resources maintaining or reducing costs and preserving data security making decisions about it can feel like being stuck between a rock and a couple of hard placesppalthough more organizations are adopting hybrid deployments as one answer to the problem theyre seen as a temporary solution when we asked it professionals and business decision makers why we found the main impediment to be lack of a common frame of reference for hybrid capabilitiespplets unpack that it needs to emmaximize existing resourcesem making them more flexible and scalable and improving performance for both machines and employees it needs to do all of it emas cheaply and safely as possibleem optimizing costs and maintaining endtoend security a hybrid cloud deployment delivers on these requirements in five key waysppstronggreater flexibility stronghybrid cloud deployments allow all sizes of enterprise to extend existing infrastructure to the cloud without massive capital investment the capability to run multiple environments seamlessly gives it the means to support devops more efficientlyppstrongfaster scalabilitystrong a consistent hybrid cloud infrastructure lets you burst resources fast and reliably scale them down again use your onpremises resources to host ip and sensitive data while extending cpuintensive activity to the cloudppstrongincreased performancestrong a consistent hybrid deployment means greater uptime and reliability as well as increased capacity in addition to efficient burst capability a wellimplemented hybrid reduces latency across network resourcesppstrongreal costefficiencystrong hybrid cloud deployments are both cheaper to operate and more robust than nonhybrid solutions the cloud side takes on maintenance and load balancing making it easier to predict setup costs and total cost of ownership it can allocate staff with more precision and reduce capital expenditures overallppstrongconsistent securitystrong cloud security is proving to be more robust than traditional firewalls because of the way hybrid cloud allocates resources across environments you can maintain burst capability while protecting sensitive data apps and intellectual property in the datacenter single signon helps your users be productiveno matter which apps or devices theyre usingwhile protecting corporate informationppa true hybrid deployment includes onpremises resources working in seamless integration with cloud resources to scale workloads efficiently it takes advantage of the robust security in an enterprise cloud to protect data and user identities across environments hybrid isnt just a transitional solution its the deployment that makes the most sense for enterprise itpcontentencoded item item titledelivering continuous innovation with windows servertitle

datacenter needs have really evolved but the one constant is the accelerating pace of change digital transformation is changing the way business is done and the most competitive organizations react quickly to new opportunities which usually involves agile applications it leaders frequently ask me how windows server is evolving to meet this new reality and how they can take advantage of new innovations at the pace their business demandspptoday id like to share more details about our new model of delivering more frequent releases of windows server starting this fall we plan to deliver two feature updates per year each spring and fall aligning to the a hrefhttpssupportofficecomenusarticleoverviewoftheupcomingchangestoofficeproplusupdatemanagementbcdfdcefccauienusamprsenusampaduswindows and office semiannual channel release cyclea this option provides opportunity for customers who are innovating quickly to take advantage of new operating system capabilities at a faster pace both in applications  particularly those built on containers and microservices as well as in the softwaredefined hybrid datacenter a hrefhttpsakamsgdvrltsystem centera will also be participating in the semiannual channel and have shared more information in their blog todayphnano server and containers no such thing as too smallhplast month at a hrefhttpsblogstechnetmicrosoftcomhybridcloudwindowsserverfordevelopersnewsfrommicrosoftbuildmicrosoft builda we announced a number of great developer and container related innovations that will be coming as part of this upcoming feature update including a new version of nano server since our first release of nano server last year weve spent a lot of time with customers to understand how theyre using nano server and where they want to see future investments two things were very clearpolliusing nano server for containers is their highest priorityliliwhen it comes to containers smaller is betterliolpbased on that feedback we are making an important change to nano server this next release will focus on making nano server the very best container image possible from these changes customers will now see the nano server images shrink in size by more than  percent further decreasing startup times and improving container density as part of this effort to focus on containers we will be removing the functionality for infrastructurerelated roles instead of using nano server for these scenarios we recommend deploying the server core installation option which includes all the roles and features you would need these changes to nano server combined with the new application innovations in net core  which enables customers to use more of their code in more places make nano server the best option for new containerbased developmentppin addition to these nano server investments were also delivering application innovations to support linux containers and workloads natively on windows server were extending the hyperv isolation capability introduced with the  release to linux containers as well so now you can run linux containers on windows server this means customers will no longer have to deploy two separate container infrastructures to support both their windows and linuxbased applications were also bringing the windows subsystem for linux wsl commonly known as bash on windows to windows server this unique combination allows developer and application administrators to use the same scripts tools procedures and container images they have been using for linux containers on their windows server container hostphserver core also coming to the semiannual channelhpi am also pleased to announce that server core will now be included in the semiannual channel server core is a headless installation option of the operating system which includes all the roles and features needed to run datacenter servers and containerized traditional applicationsppmoving forward server core will be the recommended choice for hosting your virtual machines as well as your containers which can be running a nano server container image a server core container image or even linux container images this makes server core the ideal platform to support the very popular liftandshift scenario of moving legacy applications to containerized deployments often running in azure for increased performance and manageability with reduced costsppserver core is also our recommended option for infrastructure workloads many customers dont realize that server core is the base image that runs azure and azure stack this means the investments we make in windows server for azure can be made available to customers to use in their own datacenters this makes server core a great choice for azure customers who like the idea of consistent technologies between their datacenter and the cloud one example of this in the upcoming feature update is the cluster sets functionality for increased scale of hyperconverged deployments were also continuing to add security investments such as the ability to quickly encrypt network segments on their softwaredefined networking infrastructure per their security and compliance needs you can expect new features to continue to optimize efficiency performance and security for softwaredefined datacentersphaccessing windows server in the semiannual channelhpthere are two ways to get access to windows server in the semiannual channelpulliwindows server standard or datacenter customers who are covered by software assurance will automatically have access to semiannual channel releases as they are made available servers without software assurance do not have rights to the semiannual channel releaseslilicustomers can also access these new windows

the a hrefhttpsazuremicrosoftcomenuspricinghybridusebenefitvazure hybrid use benefitaliulpwith the release of windows server  we started the process of making our monthly updates cumulative this means
