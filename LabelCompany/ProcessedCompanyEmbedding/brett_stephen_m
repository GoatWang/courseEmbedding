stephen m brett download decision pdf docket no gcf    issued by grievance commission date january   respondent stephen m brett bar number  order reprimand dispositionconduct conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice conduct before a tribunal referral solicitation confidentiality report of findings and determinations this matter came before panel b of the grievance commission on a petition of bar counsel alleging in three separate counts that respondent stephen m brett esq of york beach maine violated each of the following maine bar rules �a  conduct unworthy of an attorney �f  conduct violating the provisions of the maine bar rules �f  deceitful or dishonest conduct �f  conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice ��h  revelation of confidential information �h  failure to call upon a client to rectify fraud on tribunal �ei  misrepresentation to a judge jury or tribunal �ev  asserting a personal opinion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused �evi  engaging in conduct degrading to a tribunal �f  engaging in solicitation of employment a public hearing was conducted on december   in portland maine to determine whether a bar rule violation had occurred and whether probable cause exists for filing an information pursuant to maine bar rule b the board of overseers of the bar the board was represented by aria eee esq respondent stephen m brett esq was represented by peter j detroy iii esq no objection was made to the composition of the panel at the hearing the panel admitted board exhibits    and  as well as respondents exhibit  all without objection the panel also heard testimony of mr brett officer jamie rooney officer paul pomeroy jeffrey h moskowitz esq and thomas f lonnquist in addition counsel stipulated as the nature of testimony which would have been given by an officer ciampi if he had attended the hearing on the basis of this evidence panel b finds that respondent stephen m brett esq did not violate maine bar rules h or  or   e v as alleged but did violate each of the other maine bar rules listed above for the reasons described in greater detail below the panel issues three separate public reprimands to stephen m brett esq for violations embodied in counts i ii and iii of the petition findings of fact count i first complaint of judge john d kennedy file no  on august  judge kennedy facilitated a judiciallyassisted settlement conference between two parties and their respective counsel one of whom was attorney brett following an initial session with parties and counsel in the courtroom judge kennedy met with both counsel in his chambers and then in split sessions invited the respective parties and their counsel to meet with him separately the party and counsel not meeting with judge kennedy were generally expected to stay in the courtroom adjacent to the judges chambers so the court officer could find them when the judge wished to see them again that day attorney brett had gotten up early failed to get lunch and then discovered that the settlement conference process would move slowly that afternoon attorney brett testified that after about  to  minutes of initial discussion and another  minutes or more with judge kennedy he and his client found themselves back in the courtroom alone waiting patiently to be called back into the discussions in the course of their wait mr brett admits he first entered the area behind the bench an area adjacent to the door leading directly to the judges chambers to retrieve fresh water for his client and dispose of some trash mr brett also admits that somewhere between  and  pm becoming overcome by hunger he entered the area again with the express intent to eavesdrop on the judges discussions to attempt to ascertain how much longer they might need to wait he states he could not actually translate the mumbled conversation coming from chambers neither mr brett nor his client made any effort that afternoon to contact the court officer or the clerks office to explain their desire to leave the courtroom even momentarily court security officer paul pomeroy saw things somewhat differently at approximately  pm after he had closed another courtroom he went looking for the court security officer assigned to judge kennedy his search began by peeking through that courtrooms entrance door window officer pomeroy reports he observed attorney brett whom he recognized standing behind the judges bench an uncommon event in his experience officer pomeroy testified that he then saw mr brett speak to a person he assumed to be mr bretts client who was on the other side of the bench according to officer pomeroy mr brett next appeared to lean back to within two feet of the judges chambers door and cock his head obviously eavesdropping rather than enter the courtroom immediately however officer pomeroy continued to observe mr brett for a minute or two although the actual time he spent in further observation remains debatable at some point the officer retreated from the courtroom door and spent twenty seconds or so entering a secure hallway alongside the courtroom and speaking with judge kennedys security officer he then claims to have observed mr brett a second time this time through another window between the hallway and the courtroom in officer pomeroys opinion attorney brett was still engaged in eavesdropping at that time the officer then entered the courtroom directly from the hallway and mr brett left the area behind the bench stephen brett admits to eavesdropping asserts it was nevertheless entirely innocent and confesses in retrospect to exercising poor judgment compounded by the fact he could not actually determine whether the settlement discussions were winding down in any event officer pomeroy added that  logistically one would not need to enter the bench area to obtain water or dispose of trash and  it is possible in his opinion to hear conversations clearly through the judges door which is what he maintains mr brett was doing panel b finds that eavesdropping by attorney brett for whatever purpose did occur for an undetermined length of time count ii second complaint of judge john d kennedy file no  judge kennedy also passed along allegations he had heard that attorney stephen m brett had solicited business from a town of york police officer further investigation by the board and testimony of officer jamie a rooney fka jamie a dodge appears to confirm such an offer occurred during the winter of    ms rooney took a bicycle spinning class at a facility in portsmouth new hampshire known as spinnaker point although her preferred spinning instructor was a tom lonnquist mr lonnquist began sharing his instructor duties with his friend mr brett during that winter officer rooney tom lonnquist and stephen brett apparently all agree that ms rooney and mr brett each probably became aware of the others occupation through mr lonnquist and likely through the class exercise chatter but officer rooney testified that following one particular morning spinning session lead by mr brett he approached her to explain that he was building a house in york and in fact was already living in it he went on to explain that he had just started out on his own and certainly could use more clients it was then according to officer rooney that mr brett made an explicit offer that she take his business cards and hand them out to her arrestees for each person who eventually retained mr brett he proposed to pay her  mr brett then went on to regret he had no business cards to give her that day officer rooney described her reaction as being uncomfortable although she did nothing in response to the proposal other than avoid mr bretts classes in the future and then tell her fianc� about the incident mr brett asserts the solicitation event never happened and along with mr lonnquist suggests officer rooney more likely remembers another exercise chatter discussion in which mr lonnquist quipped that mr brett should pay officer rooney for referrals but officer rooney remains adamant that although a second referral discussion did occur that event took place weeks later she states the second business referral suggestion still made her uncomfortable but concedes it was more clearly made entirely in jest by mr lonnquist as a young officer she understandably was unprepared for such an unusual offer and now admits to being even somewhat disoriented in her response to avoid being confronted with such offers again officer rooney stopped attending the spinning classes entirely until recently panel b finds officer jamie rooneys testimony credible no obvious reason exists for her to embellish her story in fact when officer rooney revealed the original solicitation to her fianc� he reported it to the york police department which precipitated a regrettable informal investigation into the matter by her superior officers panel b believes ms rooney had every reason to minimize the first solicitation event under the circumstances but nevertheless treated the conversation with mr brett as a serious offer soliciting clients in return for cash count iii complaint of jeffrey moskowitz esq file no  the final petition count stems from mr bretts representation of the defendant in the matter of state v keith armstrong in a york county superior court criminal jury trial mr armstrong was alleged to have operated a motor vehicle while having a bloodalcohol level of  on june   mr armstrong met mr brett at the biddeford district court and asked that he be made his court appointed attorney on september   after having spoken to mr brett for only approximately    minutes the defendant and mr brett appeared at the bureau of motor vehicles office in kennebunk maine for mr armstrongs administrative license suspension hearing no one disputes that at that hearing mr armstrong testified he had driven to a eleven store parked the car walked to a nearby bar to have some drinks and when he returned to his car he was arrested in other words he maintained that he had been drinking but that he had not been driving not surprisingly the defendants story differed from that of the arresting officer an officer ciampi who testified at the trial that he witnessed mr armstrong driving while intoxicated during later plea negotiations with the assistant district attorney jeffrey h moskowitz esq mr brett explained that he expected his client to testify that he had not been driving mr moskowitz responded that if in fact that testimony would be presented and he obtained a conviction he would seek a harsher sentence because he believed the defendant would be lying under oath mr brett made no response and continued to prepare for what would be his first jury trial to make trial preparation somewhat more difficult for mr brett a few weeks prior to the trial mr armstrong spent some time in a psychiatric ward mr brett complained that it became difficult to keep mr armstrong focused it is easy to see mr armstrong may not have made a model client on january th mr armstrong did take the stand in his own defense as expected but what he had to say caught at least the prosecuting attorney off guard under direct examination by mr brett and again under cross examination mr armstrong insisted under oath that he had been very sick on june th had had nothing alcoholic to drink that day and had driven from his home to a eleven store to buy cough medicine and cigarettes mr armstrongs story ends with the arresting officer stopping him at the store and later establishing a  bloodalcohol level mr brett explained to the panel at one point that he was dumbfounded by his clients testimony of no drinking and didnt know what to do but later he also insisted that he had not made any notes at the bmv hearing and did not recollect his clients previous testimony in either case the transcript of mr armstrongs testimony and specifically mr bretts questioning of him suggests strongly that mr brett was aware of the story about to be told a story on which mr brett continued to rely obliquely in his closing argument to the jury all parties agree that mr brett did not request a sidebar or act in any other way during the trial to attempt to rectify his clients testimony despite mr armstrongs testimony the jury returned a guilty verdict and true to his word mr moskowitz sought a slightly more caustic sentence the presiding justice ultimately imposed a much more rigorous sentence noting in doing so that both he and the jury felt the defendant had lied after the trial defendants testimony continued to bother both the arresting officer and mr moskowitz who obtained the bureau of motor vehicles suspension hearing tape to compare the armstrong testimony in both hearings and to also confirm mr brett was in attendance at that earlier hearing the result is the present complaint against mr brett for allowing his client to materially deviate from his known sworn testimony effectively allowing a falsehood to be submitted to the court discussion stephen m brett esq is alleged to have violated maine bar rules in the course of his eavesdropping business solicitation and courtroom behavior we chose to examine each matter independently panel b views mr bretts admitted eavesdropping as a deplorable and lamentable exercise of unsatisfactory judgment we find no difficulty characterizing listening in on conversations behind closed doors and particularly conversations between the opposing party and a judge as conduct  unworthy of an attorney  prejudicial to the administration of justice and  degrading to a tribunal in short it is hard to imagine eavesdropping as the preferred course of action in any litigated matter particularly since there were other avenues available to mr brett to determine whether he could step out to find lunch moreover we believe that in the context of judicially assisted settlement discussions an improper advantage could be achieved by listening in on the other partys discussions with the judge it is apparent to this panel in this instance that mr brett could have no logical or innocent reason to loiter behind the bench near the judges chambers door other than to attempt to hear what was being said by his opponent if it is true as asserted by mr brett that one cannot discern the actual dialogue behind that door then certainly no justification exists for remaining in that location more than a mere few seconds panel b also views mr bretts solicitation of business whether lighthearted or deliberate as serious lawyer misconduct maine bar rule �f expressly prohibits engaging in solicitation of employment or giving anything of value to recommend employment by a client or as a reward for having made the recommendation resulting in employment by a client as observed above panel b elects to believe the town of york police officers recollection of events surrounding mr bretts offer to pay her for client referrals the terms of mr bretts business proposal could not have been more straightforward to officer rooney she was to pass out mr bretts business cards to solicit work for him and in return would receive  for each successful referral such an explicit offer even made in jest would cause a reasonable person to conclude he or she may be receiving an actual business proposition mr bretts offer coupled with his description of his current financial need at the time causes this panel to conclude that mr brett violated maine bar rule �f prohibiting solicitation of employment panel b also chooses to find that the foregoing solicitation conduct is also a violation of maine bar rule �a conduct unworthy of an attorney and maine bar rule �f conduct violating the provisions of the maine bar rules lastly mr bretts failure to take corrective action during his clients trial violates maine bar rule �h that particular bar rule compels each maine lawyer when he or she receives information clearly establishing that a client  has during the representation perpetrated a fraud upon any  tribunal to call upon the client to rectify the fraud on that tribunal the court in board of overseers v dineen  ad  me  also observed a lawyer practicing before the maine bar enjoys a privileged status upon entering the profession that lawyer takes an oath to do no falsehood nor consent to the doing of any in court  mrsa �  while the lawyer has a duty to act zealously on his clients behalf that duty is subject to ethical limitations which the lawyer may ignore at his peril among these is the affirmative obligation to inform the court of the falsity of the clients assertions state v gilcott  a d   me  id at  panel b concludes that attorney stephen m brett was or should have been aware of his clients divergent sworn testimony during his oui and bmv hearings although respondents counsel correctly points out that mr brett had no previous jury trial experience mr bretts very unfamiliarity with the process would suggest that he had committed the likely testimony of the trials only two witnesses the arresting officer and the defendant to memory in this panels view mr bretts response should have been obvious except where the information is protected not the present circumstances one must use the first opportunity to reveal the fraud to the tribunal ie utilize a sidebar during the jury trial to explain your quandary and ask to be given the opportunity to rectify the fraud no such effort was made by mr brett determinations in the event the panel concludes lawyer misconduct subject to sanction under the maine bar rules has occurred maine bar rule  e requires this panel either to issue a dismissal with a warning or issue a public reprimand or a finding of probable cause for suspension or disbarment and direct bar counsel to commence an attorney disciplinary action by filing an information pursuant to maine bar rule b this
