ministers tech industry by michael kanellos september    pm pdt gateway has tapped j edward coleman a year veteran of the distribution and services side of the computer business to be its next ceo he is the fifth ceo four permanent and one interim in six years and like his predecessors will face the challenge of getting gateway out of the budget end of the pc business although the company continues to ship pcs at a rapid rate it has had difficulty churning out profit consistently during a phone interview coleman said he wont likely change the companys strategy in the near term but over time will try to grow the enterprise and direct segments of the business he will also place more emphasis on customer service an issue that has bedeviled dell over the past two years i come to this job with the belief that service and quality customer support are the key differentiators with our customers he said it is a unique opportunity to lead a company that has great brand recognition and great products coleman also noted that hes helped turn companies around before while the ceo of compucom systems in the early part of the decade he helped turn the company from being a seller of pcs and hardware for corporations to a service provider many of compucoms competitors didnt react as quickly and faded away after compucom coleman went to arrow electronics a distributor before compucom and arrow he worked at computer sciences corp and ibm coleman will have his work cut out for him over the past few years gateway has tried a number of different strategiesgetting into consumer electronics getting rid of its stores selling more pcs in retail aiming for budget customersbut it has continued stumble when it comes to profits the company reported a net profit during the second quarter of  its first time in the black after  consecutive quarterly losses it then reported profits for the next two quarters and for the the year but so far in  gateway has lost  million in the first quarter and  million in the second quarter nonetheless the company still ships a large number of pcs gateway remains the thirdlargest pc seller in the us market with a  percent market share which is bigger than apple computers gateway also grew shipments in the second quarter in the us its main market faster than dell hewlettpackard apple lenovo and the market as a whole according to gartner during the s gateway was one of the fastestgrowing pc makers in the world volume shipments grew  to  percent in some quarters like dell it sold the bulk of its pcs directly to buyers bypassing stores and integrators in  the company almost signed a deal to become part of compaq which saw direct sales as a major threat unlike dell however gateway always had difficulty selling pcs to businesses most of its customers were individuals or government agencies as a result gateway was often stung by price cuts and the need to grow in  founder ted waitt stepped down as ceo and brought in jeff weitzen from att while gateway grew for a while consumers began to become angry with new relatively stringent warranty policies in late  gateway was one of the first manufacturers stung by the sudden decline in demand subsequently it began to close stores and lay off employees it also retreated from international markets weitzen was fired in  and waitt took over again gateway became one of the first pc makers to move into consumer electronics it raised eyebrows when it drastically lowered the price of plasma tvs but the company never became a permanent rival to the likes of samsung or panasonic in that market within a few years the company began to pare back electronics then in  gateway bought emachines which specialized in cutrate pcs waitt subsequently resigned and turned the management of the company over to wayne inouye from emachines inouye slashed jobs and pushed gateway into retail inouye stepped down in february  analysts said it was his inability to move into highermargin product categories that led to his departure rick snyder board chairman former president and ceo no  came in as interim ceo then in august  lap shun john hui made an offer for  million cash to buy the group inside gateway that sells pcs to retail stores gateways market capitalization hovered around  million at the time he was rebuffed more stories twitter still has a lot to show and
