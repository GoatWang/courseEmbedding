hydroquébec and nstar to build a new highvoltage direct current hvdc line from windsor quebec connecting with the quebec grid to a location in franklin new hampshire it is projected that the line will either run in an existing rightofway adjacent to the hvdc line that runs through new hampshire or it will connect to a rightofway in northern new hampshire that will run through the white mountains this  to mile line projected to carry  megawatts will carry electricity to approximately one million homes the issue of buying hydropower from hydroquébec had been an issue during the massachusetts gubernatorial election of  in november  the sierra club of new hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line saying that it would not only benefit connecticut and massachusetts residents more than those in new hampshire but also the concern of the flooding of boreal forests during the construction of hydroquébecs dams in northern quebec disputes with the innu first nations and the effects of tourism and the environment within the white mountain national forest transmission controversyedit while eversource reported that its electric transmission earnings were up  percent in q  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc is now investigating the utility for having transmission rates that appear to be “unjust unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential” meanwhile the potential for rooftop solar to prevent the need for new transmission lines is growing and eversource wants to cap rooftop solar growth in the state in massachusetts attorney general maura healey testified in march  before the dpu urging it to deny eversource’s proposed  million rate increase in her testimony she challenged the need for eversource’s rate increase noting nstar’s and wmeco’s high returns over the last few years referencing nstar’s  return of more than  percent attorney general healey told the dpu that “last year no state public utility commission in the country allowed a return that high” between  and  eversource’s shareholders of common stock received a cumulative total return including quarterly dividends and the change in the market price per share of  percent major projectsedit eversource energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the power grid in southwest connecticut the first project was construction of the  million  kilovolt bethelnorwalk transmission line through the western part of the state and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as northeast utilities with united illuminating an upgrade to the mile  km  kilovolt middletownnorwalk transmission line was energized in  at a cost of  million in  the greater springfield reliability project a component of the ongoing new england eastwest solution was energized at a cost of  million the project addressed numerous reliability issues with the springfield ma areas  kv transmission system by constructing two new  kv lines to the agawam substation one line north to ludlow and the other south to north bloomfield connecticut the new  kv corridor added a new strong interface between massachusetts and connecticut the project also involved rebuilding all of the  kv lines along the transmission corridor between south agawam and ludlow to increase their capacities building a new  kv transmission substation in east springfield cadwell replacing the fairmont  kv transmission substation in chicopee with a new substation across the street and configuring a new  kv line from south agawam to southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former  kv path between agawam and north bloomfield the new cadwell and fairmont switching stations allowed a number of threeterminal  kv lines to be broken up into twoterminal lines finally the project allowed a problematic underground  kv transmission path through the city of springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle the underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the breckwood substation in springfield a previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary on november   cutover of  kv lines to the new fairmont switching station was complete marking substantial completion of the gsrp in may  eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in queensbrook the project involves replacing underground wire and transformers throughout the qb referencesedit  northeast utilities

required regulated utilities to divest generating stations to competitive suppliers in  the company divested all of the generating assets of wmeco and clp per requirements of the massachusetts and

murphy ct the fourth biggest contributor to representative joe courtney ct and the sixth biggest contributor to representative john larson ct during the july  to june  period during the longer fouryear period from july  to june  northeast utilities and its executives donated  to rep christopher murphy  to rep joe courtney  to rep john larson  to rep jim himes ct and  to rep rosa delauro ct in  eversource fought the rooftop solar industry and supported antisolar policies in massachusetts they staffed the state house with lobbyists in order to end legislation promoting growth of the solar industry during the  legislative session in new hampshire eversource opposed an increase to the states solar net metering cap new hampshires cap is lower than all neighboring states hvdc transmissionedit as northeast utilities the company signed on a joint venture with hydroquébec and nstar to build a new highvoltage direct current hvdc line from windsor quebec connecting with the quebec grid to a location in franklin new hampshire it is projected that the line will either run in an existing rightofway adjacent to the hvdc line that runs through new hampshire or it will connect to a rightofway in northern new hampshire that will run through the white mountains this  to mile line projected to carry  megawatts will carry electricity to approximately one million homes the issue of buying hydropower from hydroquébec had been an issue during the massachusetts gubernatorial election of  in november  the sierra club of new hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line saying that it would not only benefit connecticut and massachusetts residents more than those in new hampshire but also the concern of the flooding of boreal forests during the construction of hydroquébecs dams in northern quebec disputes with the innu first nations and the effects of tourism and the environment within the white mountain national forest transmission controversyedit while eversource reported that its electric transmission earnings were up  percent in q  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc is now investigating the utility for having transmission rates that appear to be “unjust unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential” meanwhile the potential for rooftop solar to prevent the need for new transmission lines is growing and eversource wants to cap rooftop solar growth in the state in massachusetts attorney general maura healey testified in march  before the dpu urging it to deny eversource’s proposed  million rate increase in her testimony she challenged the need for eversource’s rate increase noting nstar’s and wmeco’s high returns over the last few years referencing nstar’s  return of more than  percent attorney general healey told the dpu that “last year no state public utility commission in the country allowed a return that high” between  and  eversource’s shareholders of common stock received a cumulative total return including quarterly dividends and the change in the market price per share of  percent major projectsedit eversource energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the power grid in southwest connecticut the first project was construction of the  million  kilovolt bethelnorwalk transmission line through the western part of the state and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as northeast utilities with united illuminating an upgrade to the mile  km  kilovolt middletownnorwalk transmission line was energized in  at a cost of  million in  the greater springfield reliability project a component of the ongoing new england eastwest solution was energized at a cost of  million the project addressed numerous reliability issues with the springfield ma areas  kv transmission system by constructing two new  kv lines to the agawam substation one line north to ludlow and the other south to north bloomfield connecticut the new  kv corridor added a new strong interface between massachusetts and connecticut the project also involved rebuilding all of the  kv lines along the transmission corridor between south agawam and ludlow to increase their capacities building a new  kv transmission substation in east springfield cadwell replacing the fairmont  kv transmission substation in chicopee with a new substation across the street and configuring a new  kv line from south agawam to southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former  kv path between agawam and north bloomfield the new cadwell and fairmont switching stations allowed a number of threeterminal  kv lines to be broken up into twoterminal lines finally the project allowed a problematic underground  kv transmission path through the city of springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle the underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the breckwood substation in springfield a previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary on november   cutover of  kv lines to the new fairmont switching station was complete marking substantial completion of the gsrp in may  eversource began an electrical infrastructure project in queensbrook the project involves replacing
