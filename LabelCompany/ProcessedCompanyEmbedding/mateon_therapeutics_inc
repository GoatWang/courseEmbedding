for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia aml and myelodysplastic syndrome mds like its structural analog cap combretastatin aphosphate or fosbretabulin oxi has been observed to compromise the tumor vasculature resulting in extensive tumor cell death and necrosis while also possibly affecting the cell shape and attachment of hematopoietic stem cells in addition once administered via infusion it forms a highly reactive orthoquinone metabolite which has been shown in preclinical studies to have antitumor activity in preclinical studies oxi demonstrated potent activity in mice that were carriers of the highrisk subtype flt of human aml these data have been published in the journal blood oxi was studied in an investigatorsponsored phase  study for the treatment of patients with aml or mds the openlabel doseescalating study was sponsored in part by the leukemia  lymphoma society’s therapy acceleration program and was conducted by researchers at the university of florida the study evaluated the safety profile maximum tolerated dose mtd and biologic activity of oxi in patients with relapsed or refractory aml or mds adverse events attributable to oxi infusion included bone pain fever anemia and thrombocytopenia hypertension was manageable and plasma ldh and uric acid increased by at least fold within hours after oxi infusions suggesting leukemia cell destruction clinical data from this phase  study were presented in december  at the th american society of hematology annual meeting and exposition in new orleans louisiana results from  patients showed that oxi was

or fosbretabulin cap is our lead investigational drug and is a potent tubulinbinding vascular disrupting agent vda compared to other tubulinbinding vdas we believe that cap has shown the most robust and consistent evidence of tumor blood flow shutdown in clinical trials to date we are studying cap in platinumresistant ovarian cancer proc we are also exploring its potential use in other tumor types such as neuroendocrine tumors nets glioblastoma multiforme gbm hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer because its mechanism of action moa is different than any approved drug for the treatment of cancer its success in the clinic could potentially advance the treatment of many cancers cap exerts its antitumor effect by targeting tumor blood vessels ultimately depriving tumors of oxygen and essential nutrients leading to the death of interior tumor cells but sparing some cells on the outer rim of the tumor where the tumor cells are able to derive their nutrients from blood vessels in the proximal normal tissue this is in contrast to the moa of currently available antiangiogenic agents aas which prevents vascular endothelial growth factor vegfdriven angiogenesis mostly occurring at the rim of tumors for this reason combination therapy with agents that inhibit the vegf pathway of angiogenesis will be the focus of the company’s clinical studies moving forward initial

therapeutics inc key developments mateon therapeutics inc announces new interim preclinical data on cap in combination with checkpoint inhibitors jun   mateon therapeutics inc announced that cap in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor significantly reduced tumor size in a ct colon cancer animal model mateon evaluated its lead investigational drug cap which is also currently being studied in a phase  clinical trial in platinumresistant ovarian cancer in a syngeneic mouse model in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in order to assess the effects of cap on more advanced and difficulttotreat tumors tumors in this study were allowed to grow for  days prior to treatment consequently beginning tumor sizes were approximately three times larger than those generally evaluated in preclinical studies cap increases the effects of checkpoint inhibitors because it rapidly causes tumor cell death which likely increases tumor antigen presentation and tcell activation and the overall immunologic response these new results reinforce similar results observed in other studies and importantly the animals in the combination cap and antictla antibody treatment group are continuing to show declines in tumor volume beyond day  this is the second study and tumor type to demonstrate robust complementary effects when mateon’s cap is provided in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor results obtained approximately four months ago in a smaller tumor emt mammary model also showed strong synergy when antictla antibodies were combined with cap mateon therapeutics

the number of patients enrolled and projected enrollment trends the company expects the third interim analysis representing  patients to be completed in late september  ox is a doseascending phase b clinical trial evaluating oxi in combination with cytarabine in patients with recurrentrelapsed acute myeloid leukemia aml mateon recently completed enrollment and treatment for the fourth cohort of  mgm of oxi and no dose limiting toxicities or significant safety issues were identified among the three patients one patient treated in the fourth cohort experienced a significant aml blast reduction with blast counts going from  upon enrollment to  following the first cycle of treatment however the patient subsequently experienced an unrelated adverse event and withdrew from the study approximately two weeks after the last dose of oxi in the second cycle of treatment prior to an additional blast measurement and accordingly did not meet the criteria for a complete remission three complete remissions were observed in the first three cohorts  overall in the clinical trial to date each of which occurred after two cycles of treatment and two complete remissions remain ongoing at  and  months enrollment is ongoing in the fifth cohort of  mgm of oxi the pazofos study is a phase b investigatorsponsored study being conducted in the uk evaluating the combination of cap and the tkiinhibitor pazopanib for patients with advanced recurrent ovarian cancer to date the study has enrolled and treated  patients with cap and pazopanib in the phase b and phase  portions of the trial the study sponsor the christie nhs trust has temporarily suspended enrollment in the trial in order to collect and review additional information on two recent serious adverse events – one patient in the study experienced hypertension and myocardial ischemia and a second patient experienced chest pain in both cases the events were of short duration and the clinical symptoms resolved the label for pazopanib which is not approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer in the us contains warnings for cardiac dysfunction arterial thrombotic events and hypertension cap has been observed in most patients to cause an acute and transient increase in blood pressure following administration following review of the data available for the patients in pazofos the company does not believe any changes or adjustments to mateon’s focus study are warranted focus has restrictive enrollment criteria for patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors and specific algorithms for treatment of patients that experience blood pressure increases the markey cancer center at the university of kentucky recently began a phase  study evaluating the combination of cap and everolimus for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors in the first part of the study patients are being treated with two different dosing regimens of cap in combination with everolimus to evaluate the safety of the drug

otcqxmatn a biopharmaceutical company developing vascular disrupting agents vdas for the treatment of orphan oncology indications today announced that the us food and drug administration fda has granted fast track designation to the company’s product candidate oxi for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia aml fast track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or lifethreatening conditions and address unmet medical need once an investigational agent receives fast track designation early and frequent communication between the fda and a drug company is encouraged throughout the entire drug development and review process the frequency of communication allows potential issues to be resolved quickly and as they arise often leading to earlier drug approval and access by patients “the receipt of fast track designation from the fda represents an important milestone for our oxi program and follows promising results including three complete remissions from the initial cohorts of our ongoing ox study in patients with relapsedrefractory aml” said william d schwieterman md president and chief executive officer of mateon “this latest development provides further momentum for this groundbreaking study and occurs in advance of the completion of the fifth patient cohort in ox – which we expect by the end of this year” about acute myeloid leukemia a devastating form of cancer of the blood and bone marrow aml is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults and accounts for the greatest number of leukemia deaths in the united states there is no standard regimen of care for patients who relapse following frontline treatment or have refractory disease according to the nih’s national cancer institute surveillance epidemiology and end results seer program there are an estimated  new cases and  deaths expected in  in the united states aml arises from a clonal hematopoietic stem cell and is characterized by accumulation of malignant myeloblasts in the bone marrow and resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis aml often responds initially to frontline treatment of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy but it often relapses and longterm diseasefree survival is low posing a significant challenge to treat relapsed andor refractory disease about oxi oxi combretastatin adiphosphate or cap is a dualmechanism vascular disrupting agent in preclinical and clinical studies it has been observed to compromise the tumor vasculature resulting in extensive tumor cell death and necrosis while also possibly affecting the cell shape and attachment of hematopoietic stem cells oxi is being evaluated for relapsedrefractory aml and myelodysplastic syndrome mds in combination with cytarabine in ox a phase b study in addition to fast track status oxi has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of aml in both the united states and europe about mateon mateon therapeutics inc is a biopharmaceutical company seeking to realize the full potential of vascular targeted therapy vtt in oncology vtt includes vascular disrupting agents vdas such as the investigational drugs that mateon is developing and antiangiogenic agents aas a number of which are fdaapproved and widely used in cancer treatment these two approaches have distinct yet complementary mechanisms of action at mateon we believe that we can significantly improve cancer therapy by employing these two complementary approaches simultaneously when utilized this way vdas obstruct existing blood vessels in the tumor leading to significant central tumor cell death while aas prevent the formation of new tumor blood vessels mateon is committed to leveraging our intellectual property and the product development expertise of our highly skilled management team to enable vtt to realize its true potential and to bring muchneeded new therapies to cancer patients worldwide safe harbor
