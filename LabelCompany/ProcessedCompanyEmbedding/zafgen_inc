company is focused on improving the health and wellbeing of patients affected by obesity and complex metabolic disorders the companys lead product candidate beloranib is a twiceweekly subcutaneous injection being developed for the treatment of multiple indications including severe obesity in rare diseases such as praderwilli syndrome pws and hypothalamic injuryassociated obesity hiao including craniopharyngiomaassociated obesity beloranib is in phase iii stage of development for pws it is also developing zgn a livertargeted methionine aminopeptidase  metap inhibitor for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash and abdominal obesity as well as other secondgeneration metap inhibitors for the treatment of severe obesitybeloranib is an injectable small molecule therapy with a mechanism of action that reduces hunger while stimulating the use of stored fat as an energy source beloranib is an antiobesity agent that addresses over two abnormalities that are present in the obese patient including hunger that is inappropriate relative to the amount of energy stored as fat and dysregulation of fat metabolism which causes more fat to be made and stored in an obese patient than in a lean person beloranib acts through the inhibition of metap an enzyme that modulates the activity of various cellular processes that control metabolism metap inhibitors work at least in part by directing metap binding to cellular stress mediators thereby reducing the tone of signals that drive lipid synthesis by the liver and fat storage throughout the body in this manner metap inhibition serves the purpose of reestablishing balance to the ways the body packages and metabolizes fat and glucose metap inhibitors reduce the production of new fatty acid molecules by the liver and help convert stored fats into useful energy while reducing hunger the product has completed the phase iib clinical trialsthe companys other product candidate zgn is in preclinical development stages the company is also evaluating additional metap inhibitors beyond beloranib as development candidates for the treatment of severe obesity in the general population metap inhibitors may also have utility in the treatment of other metabolic diseases such as nash and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafldthe company competes with neurosearch as roche group glaxosmithkline arena pharmaceuticals inc vivus
