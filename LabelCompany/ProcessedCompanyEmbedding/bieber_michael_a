 justin bieber i want to be the next michael jackson maclean’s archives a candid interview with the new king of pop brian d johnson november   follow briandjohnson twitter facebook google share linkedin reddit email   paul stuartcamera pressredux everyone’s waiting for justin bieber it’s midafternoon in washington on the eve of the presidential election but for the hordes of young girls gathered outside a downtown arena there’s only one leader who can bring salvation hours before the yearold canadian pop star will hit the stage fans have mobbed every entrance ready to scream at any hint of movement they shriek as one of  tour buses sits idling outside a garage ramp as if sheer lung power could shatter the tinted windows inside the arena bieber’s bodyguard a softspoken man named kenny hamilton shows off a party trick he opens a door revealing his face to fans on the sidewalk they go berserk in bieberland even kenny is a celebrity he has more than a million twitter followers which puts him neck and neck with paul mccartney bieber has  million—second only to lady gaga—and gains a new one roughly every second the first superstar child of social media justin bieber recently became the first to score three billion hits on youtube where an amateur video led to his discovery at  however as his believe tour burns across north america—he plays ottawa montreal toronto and the grey cup in the next few weeks—being the world’s hottest teen idol is still not enough in an exclusive interview with maclean’s he makes it clear he wants to be nothing less than the next michael jackson the new king of pop “that’s where i want to be” he says “i don’t just want to be a teen heartthrob” bieber has already borrowed the machinelike dance moves the glitter gloves and a gentler version of the jacko crotch grab but can such a sweet canadian kid be bad well in february bieber will put out a song that he says will “shock” his fans scooter braun his yearold manager says “think of the wildest thing you can think of and think more” backstage at the arena i’ve just shaken bieber’s hand when he spots a familiar face then bolts down the corridor and takes a flying leap into a bear hug with jaden smith the yearold rapperactor the son of will smith looks tiny even next to the fivefootsix biebs the two of them disappear into his dressing room to rehearse a duet for the show while i wait outside with an older couple who don’t look like typical fans they turn out to be grandparents bruce and diane dale who helped raise the singer in stratford ont their unwed daughter gave birth to justin at  while his yearold dad was in jail the dales have been on tour with bieber for three weeks travelling in their own bus but do they get to see much of him “we had breakfast with him once” says bruce so why do they tag along “something is better than nothing and he wants us with him” bieber’s mother pattie mallette is busy with her own tour promoting nowhere but up a breathless memoir of sexual abuse drug abuse attempted suicide at  and domestic rages with jeremy bieber—which ends with her redemption as a bornagain christian and a stage mom armed with a camcorder she has made peace with jeremy who’s now married with two children and is part of justin’s life bieber’s grandparents tell me they found it hard to believe parts of the book and that they knew nothing of their daughter’s adolescent horrors until they read it “there are three sides to every story” offers bruce dale “there’s one side the other side and then there’s the truth” the bodyguard ushers me into bieber’s dressing room which is equipped with a pingpong table when i tell him i used to be pretty good he hands me a paddle but the pressure of playing with a kid ranked the world’s thirdmost powerful celebrity by forbes throws me off my game then we settle into that game of spin and deflection known as the celebrity interview bieber is dressed all in black with baggy hiphop pants and a leather tank top a backwards baseball cap that reads “dope” crowns his pompadour and he sports some major bling—a diamond stud in his ear a diamondencrusted ring and a diamondrimmed watch that hangs heavy on his slender wrist polite and serious looking me straight in the eye bieber comes across as a wellcoached kid determined to ace an exam a publicist has ordered me not to ask about his girlfriend singeractress selena gomez and the reason becomes apparent a few days later with news that their twoyear romance is over bieber shies away from touchy subjects declining to express his views on the us election or confirm if he still opposes abortion “i try and just be a musician and not worry about politics and abortion and stuff i just get in trouble talking about it” and when asked if he approves of premarital sex he says “that’s a question you shouldn’t be asking” but he’s happy to talk about strategies of stardom and his debt to michael jackson “all our decisions are based on longterm decisions” he says speaking in the corporate “we” of a shrewdly managed superstar “we use michael as a template the things that he did for his career—a lot of the times it was good some of the times it was bad—but he was successful from being young to being old that’s what i want to get to i don’t want to grow up and lose my young fans singing inappropriate music” bieber knows how precarious teenage stardom can be “now i’m at the top” he says “there’s only one way to go and it’s down that gives me the motivation to stay on top and keep pushing i grew up with a really competitive side playing sports—basketball hockey and soccer i don’t want to be secondbest thirdbest fourthbest i want to be the best that takes a lot of dedication and hard work you gotta have plans” it’s disarming to see such unwavering confidence and ambition in the browneyed gaze of a teenager who still looks like a kid with a crown tattooed on his chest he is the boy who would be king “we have this running thing called what would michael do” says braun “it’s not that justin wants to be michael jackson but his thing is if michael was the greatest then why not look to him you’re supposed to study the greats their successes and failures” even though jackson’s success was overshadowed by a lost childhood freakish behaviour and a fatal drug overdose he set the gold standard for pop stardom in bieber’s view “i model my career on the decisions michael made and how he kept his young fan base and kept his private life private all those things add up to me that made him super interesting” bieber also pays direct homage to jackson in his music die in your arms a dreamy ballad on believe samples jackson’s we’ve got a good thing going which he recorded at  on maria a bonus track on believe deluxe edition bieber mimics jackson’s billie jean right down to the strangled vocal—and its reallife inspiration from a paternity suit the song is about mariah yeater’s failed bid last year to claim bieber fathered her son as a child star with an angelic voice who shot to fame on the wings of r  b it’s no wonder bieber identifies so closely with jackson jackson and elvis are the only solo male pop stars who have reached the stratosphere bieber is aiming for and he also finds some inspiration in presley “i like that elvis was a good boy but wasn’t a good boy at the same time” he says “he made that infamous dance that shocked everyone i’m not picture perfect i don’t want to be inappropriate just not perfect like a disney kid nothing against   ” justin timberlake miley cyrus—and gomez—were all discovered by disney while bieber honed his chops busking in the streets of stratford and toronto by now the fairytale narrative is wellknown after he showed an uncanny talent for music that began with playing drums at  his mom uploaded amateur videos of him singing to youtube braun talent manager and party promoter for atlanta’s hiphop elite stumbled across one and was blown away after tracking down the yearold prodigy at his school in stratford braun flew beiber and his mother to atlanta initially mallette had qualms she had her heart set on a christian manager braun is jewish but he won her trust signed bieber to his schoolboy records and moved them down to atlanta after winning a bidding war against timberlake’s production company the singer usher produced bieber’s my world which made him the first artist to chart seven singles on billboard’s hot  with a debut album last year’s biopicconcert movie justin bieber never say never racked up  million at the north american box office a record for a concert film and with the release of his third studio cd believe bieber has now sold  million albums he’s also become a minimogul he’s plowed millions into a series of tech startups he launched a profitable fragrance named somewhere two movies are being developed for him to star in including a basketball drama with mark wahlberg and he helped launch fellow canadian singer carly rae jepsen by throwing a spotlight on her infectious hit call me maybe—jepsen  signed with braun and is now touring as bieber’s opening act in a pop universe virtually ruled by women lady gaga taylor swift katy perry is he jealous of a female protege whose no  hit eclipsed his single boyfriend on the pop charts “not at all” he says “i found this song she’s my first artist so it’s great to have that stat—the biggest song of the year i definitely want to pay it forward” now a precocious impresario in his own right bieber may be the most judiciously groomed pop star ever incubated by the music business he might have come from a broken home in smalltown ontario but under braun’s tutelage “i feel like a protective uncle” he was adopted by an extended family of hiphop royalty usher and ludacris his boyhood idols became his mentors he would record with drake and lil wayne and become pals with welterweight boxer floyd mayweather jr he would enlist a legion of producers a vocal coach and a stylist who became known as his “swagger” coach “it was a joke” bieber explains “he was a straight male so he didn’t want to be known as a stylist he didn’t teach me how to walk or anything” with the kind of athletic discipline he once brought to hockey and basketball bieber works with choreographers to hone his stage moves “today we spent two hours rehearsing for this dance that i do for beauty and a beat” he says pulling out his phone to show a video of him shirtless executing a semaphorecrisp routine “when everybody’s behind me doing that it will be cool” as bieber comes of age he’s gradually turning up the erotic heat—on the weekend he put a postbreakup pic of himself shirtless on instagram at one point in his concert he bares his abs to the screams of the crowd and by the end he’s stripped to the waist “i’ve been working out in the gym getting bigger” he says with a coy smile “trying to get sexy for the ladies” it may be raining supermodels—last week bieber performed at a victoria’s secret fashion show—but his future depends on the music his voice which has deepened since the early records swoops through love songs with a sensual maturity and a soulful ache beyond his years it’s the reason he didn’t become a rock singer “i love classic rock” he says “ my voice though always wanted to do runs vocal acrobatics” to demonstrate he sings a couple of lines letting the notes softly somersault through a flurry of modulations too often that tender voice gets lost in the slick production of pop dance beats but bieber swears the next album will lean more toward r  b “it’s going to be so different” he says “it’s not going to be anything people are used to hearing i want to just shock people and i have a platform to do that people are listening with my twitter following with my youtube following i have their ears right now rather than make music that everyone else is making with the same fouronthefloor beat i have a chance to change music there’s only a certain amount of people that can do that” bieber cowrites most of his material and braun says he is on a creative tear “justin is always writing he’s written  songs in the last three weeks on the road when he feels even a little bit like the world is starting to doubt him he kicks into overdrive he’s very competitive—a canadian hockey player at heart” as for his future braun says “you know what the key to longevity is just make f–king great songs be nice to people and make great songs that’s the formula” the question remains amid all the egoinflating adulation can bieber shapeshift from teen heartthrob to adult superstar without losing his soul “the pressures of  people a night chanting your name and people wanting to cater to you can really screw a kid up” braun concedes “but the idea that michael lost his childhood and how much that affected him is something we’ve tried to avoid the canadian in him has played a tremendous role in how he’s been able to handle this his roots his family his grandparents—there’s something about it that keeps you grounded” but there’s nothing modest about the sports car braun bought him for his th birthday an allchrome fisker karma hybrid that’s a paparazzi magnet—bieber was ticketed for speeding away from photographers “i felt he was going to get a sports car anyway” says braun “i’d rather it be one with four doors so security can be in it it also sends a message by being an electric car” justin he adds “is not attached to material things at all he has a signed michael jackson picture and that’s the only thing he cares about losing” bieber has bought a million house in the los angeles suburb of calabasas home to the kardashians but braun says it gives him privacy and he could afford something “ times more lavish” his mother now rents a house nearby which his grandmother notes is “nicer than his” his grandparents declined to relocate to la because they were happily retired in stratford but after bieber and gomez spent a weekend there while a mob of fans camped out across the road he said he wouldn’t be back unless they moved so they built a house out of town on a site surrounded by marshland while bieber’s grandparents are quietly supportive behind the scenes his mother has surfed his wake into the media spotlight making the talkshow rounds with her memoir from its multiple incidents of childhood sexual abuse by nonfamily members to the grisly breakup with justin’s dad—which climaxes with her smashing a beer bottle into his teeth—it seems like too much information for any son “yeah it was a lot for me to hear” bieber says “but i’m older now when i was younger my mum never told me any of this stuff it was definitely hard reading those stories but i’m supportive of her writing the book it’s cool” mallette recalls telling justin about her sexual abuse when he was  though not in detail interviewed by phone from la she says she’s less involved in his life now that he’s of age “it’s tough letting go he’s more like ‘mom i want my space’ but no one cares like mama business people come and go but i will always be his mother i continue to be the loudest voice in his life” mallette’s christian faith has left an indelible mark on her son—with a tattoo of jesus adorning the back of his left calf but when i ask about his religious views he says “i never said i was religious i’m not religious at all my mum isn’t religious either she’s spiritual” however his faith “plays a significant role” bieber adds “i believe in god and stuff i believe he’s given me this platform for a reason to help change people’s lives that’s why in each of my shows i try to give a positive message i say i’m on this stage and i never thought i could do this whether you want to be a doctor or an engineer you just gotta have that motivation and you can do anything if you set your mind to it” bieber’s fans call themselves “beliebers” and he’s made the word “believe” his brand it’s inked on his forearm which also sports a fresh tattoo of an owl perched on a key “he’s holding the belief key” says bieber “the whole tour is based on this key i like the owl because it signifies    what’s the word” wisdom “wisdom yeah” that night in washington when bieber hits the stage there’s no lack of faith the collective shriek from thousands of young girls splits the night as their idol descends from the rafters harnessed to a giant pair of metallic wings a super angel dressed in white but for a pair of dark glasses bieber moves in lockstep with a dozen dancers morphing through a suite of scenarios involving astronaut suits white parasols and a blackclad posse right out of a michael jackson video his band is led by ottawaborn dan kanter his guitarist and musical director who plays a gibson les paul emblazoned with a canadian flag bieber’s celebrity narrative is part of the show his starisborn fable flashes by in a montage of his childhood youtube videos a cinematic clip shows him being chased by paparazzi in a bondlike action sequence and the name justin bieber is trumpeted so often that at times the concert resembles a rally late in the show he cruises the stands in a cherry picker riding waves of hysteria as he sails past reefs of outstretched arms suddenly he’s coming our way and the girl in the black minidress next to me is in a frenzy he comes close so close that he can’t not see her she screams and screams begging for eye contact that never comes as bieber glides by it’s a controlled hysteria while shrieking her lungs out the girl holds her idol in the steady frame of an outthrust smartphone so what begins on youtube ends up on youtube as the singer and his fans try to connect through a starmaker machine that’s bigger than both of them follow us on

will ever take the place of the king of pop michael jackson reply ↓ shaz j goodband on march   at  pm he’s going to accomplish nothing if he keeps hiding in mj’s shadow he needs to develop a voice on his own his own musical style some kind of artistry because right now there is very little of that in him everything’s borrowed from somewheresomeone else reply ↓ anna calamoneri on november   at  am he is well on his way …and that is tragic reply ↓ beefair on november   at  am i guess its a sign of human eveloution that the present generations have no sense of taste when it comes to what they hear or see then there is media that cook what they call news to feed them i bet they feel like being brought up in a paultry farm “wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are” kurt cobain reply ↓ huh on november   at  am “i was trying to write the ultimate pop song i was basically trying to rip off the pixies i have to admit it when i heard the pixies for the first time i connected with that band so heavily that i should have been in that band—or at least a pixies cover band we used their sense of dynamics being soft and quiet and then loud and hard” – kurt cobain reply ↓ sandifjm on november   at  pm how unhumble…there will only ever be one michael jackson reply ↓ anne kelly on november   at  am i am a huge fan of michael jackson and probably wouldn’t recognize a justin bieber song if i heard one playing but people need to lighten up a bit on the “next michael jackson” comment all artists are influenced by others michael jackson frequently spoke of how he emulated jackie wilson and james brown when he first began performing ideally an artist will be able to create something entirely new using their various influences as inspiration but stop busting the kid’s chops it’s not hard to imagine a young michael jackson musing about being “the next james brown” reply ↓ sandifjm on november   at  pm i disagree mj never wanted to be someone else he was a huge fanboy and wore his admiration on his sleeve for fred astaire james brown jackie wilson etc but whatever influences he drew upon he elevated and took to another level…always he strove to be an innovator to do something new and to not be like anyone else…and he succeeded he was sooo unique and different than anything or anyone out there especially before everyone started copying his moves and style both singing and dress he changed music created what is common in videos now and opened doors in a way that this kid will never be able to and he does not have an equal talent in either singing or dancing mj is known for wanting to find sounds “the ear had never heard” he was always innovating he really did “study the greats and become greater” as he always said justin can’t touch him but he should take his advice and try to be himself and find his own style instead of jacking from everyone and especially michael it’s one thing to admire to borrow a little here and there but maintain your individuality but that is not what he is doing making proclamations like that and accepting the king of pop moniker he isn’t doing himself any favors michael was much more than his than his angelic voice and magical performances he was a very kind gentle and humble human being as well as a massive humanitarian justin bieber has a looong ways to go before he can even touch his shoes i also disagree that he will one day rival mj elvis or the beatles as another poster said it just aint happenin’…no one will ever rival their sales or anything else for that matter you can’t be the next anyone there is only one michael jackson he can’t be duplicated bieber needs to be his one and only bieber michael jackson was a one off a once in a lifetime and you can’t replace the irreplaceable it is impossible reply ↓ nina on november   at  pm justin bieber you’re good but you can’t compare yourself to the legendary michael jackson reply ↓ mefloydkirk on november   at  am michael jackson molested little boys so justin you want to be just like him maybe become a drug addict and die of a stupid overdose not a good role model people make a big deal about jacko because he’s dead now and can’t fall further off of the pedestal when he was alive he was seen as a crazy has been reply ↓ nacken on november   at  pm michael was innocent reply ↓ ana on november   at  pm i agree that he shouldn’t compare himself to the iconic michael jackson but he’s good he’s already established himself as an entertainer of this generation if he keeps the momentum he will be big he could very well rival elvis or michael jackson and really is that such a bad thing no one has come close to mj since mj it’s time to pass the torch to a new generation and i’m no kid tween teen twentysomething i took my child to his concert just last month as close to a hater as they come he changed my mind it’s not my style of music but there is charisma there is entertainment i wish him all the best and all the success reply ↓ hater converted on november   at  pm have you heard this twit sing without being autotuned he can’t sing the artists you mention in your post are just that artists this little flash in the pan is no artist reply ↓ saywhat on november   at  am only jackson and elvis never heard of a guy called sinatra reply ↓ these boots on november   at  am let’s be realistic bieb maybe you should just aim for the ‘king of autotune’ instead reply ↓ thestraightpoop on november   at  am i have nothing against jb but there will never be another michael jackson michael will ever be the king of pop and nobody else can ever take his place  ever  michael jackson   reply ↓ monika hans on november   at  pm great who can get young justin the number for jackson’s personal doctor reply ↓ sean webb on november   at  pm justin bieber can dream what he wants but comparing him to the biggest names in the history of music michael jackson and the beatles does not sound right at all no one i repeat – no one can ever be as big as mj or the beatles no one can influence the music industry and the world the way these mj and the beatles did no space to etch justin bieber’s name – the teen hearthrob who will fade away soon are the hits in youtube count as “success” these days hang on gangnam style has the biggest hits – but does it mean psy is an icon who has influenced the world through music not even close reply ↓ harryrrr on november   at  am oh pallllease after  minutes of listening to bieber and you get bored always the same beat reply ↓ prenaud on november   at  pm michael jackson is and always will be the one and only king of pop and this entity has a long way to go and yet never manage to be even a shadow of the true king michael jackson reply ↓ lety on november   at  pm do your research next time he did have a first album you never mentioned and his perfume is someday not somewhere reply ↓ tara on november   at  am you guys clearly delete comments you deleted mine about you guys not doing the correct research and every single one on here is negative towards him you didn’t deserve an interview with him at all reply ↓ tara on november   at  pm well that will definitely never happen i know i should never say never but this is a safe one michael jackson was one of the most talented performers ever and there’ll never be a “next michael jackson” or a new “king of pop” reply ↓ elliott on november   at  pm never justin p reply ↓ sam morai on june   at  pm that would be great justin but can you just fast forward straight to jackson at  yo and say  mos reply ↓ jack boques on december   at  am mj is untouchable no one will ever be able to amount to his fame and success his talent knew no other i will say justin bieber is talented but his career will evintually burn out he is too cocky and will never be able to maintain this false stardom with yound teens mj’s crown will forever rest with mj reply ↓ eric maslen on december   at  pm your claim that bieber was”the first artist to chart seven singles on billboard’s hot  with a debut album” not so there is at least one other recording artist to achieve that feat he was also canadian his name jack scott reply ↓ michael g on january   at  am better aim higher than that  mj was an extremely talented performer as well as a prolific pedophile who used his celebrity to escape responsibility for his actions reply ↓ tyson on march   at  am well there you go another punk with his  minutes of fame wants to be a bankrupt pedophile that died in his own stupidity… i hope you get what you wish for you fluoride child reply ↓ truth huts on march   at  am why is bieber comparing himself to mj he has to know he isn’t going to get many likes for that… reply ↓ mt on march   at  am michael must be rollin’ in his grave right now…how dare you even compare reply ↓ neo ajaka on may   at  pm if you want to be the next michael jackson you shall succumb the same fate as him  overdose and die young reply ↓ tonysfoyul on january   at  pm pity …one would hope that he would have the talent and capacity to establish his own niche rather than following the example of an incredibly talented… but hoplessly screwed up individual such as mj reply ↓ overthe hill on january   at  pm just looked at the dates…holy cow i am in the archives reply ↓ overthe hill on january   at  pm he suffers delusions of grandeur he is uneducated youth with no sense or original ideas reply ↓ gary on january   at  am listen carefully justin bieber was says  i am fan of michael jackson justin never come michael jackson’s level mj is a legend  king of pop  justin fan’s only some countries but ♥ michael jackson’s fans over all in the world  justin is a little bit thing but michael jackson is a very very big thing  i proud of me because  i am big big big fan of ♥ michael jackson ♥  i always love michael jackson’s fans thankss all reply ↓ sam morai on june   at  pm it does not and will never exist “the next” michael jackson this justin bieber should know it at this point if he wasn’t so fool it is not enough to copy him you simply are not him and never will be you will never have his magic michael jackson is and will forever be the genius so stfu fool reply ↓ sam morai on june   at  pm well that will definitely never happen i know i should never say never but this is a safe one michael jackson was one of the most talented performers ever and there’ll never be a “next michael jackson” or a new “king of pop” ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reply ↓ sam morai on june   at  pm i don’t know why anyone would open their mouth and say they want to be the next michael jackson he was naming his top five artists and gave a short reason why he picked mj as  but then again he named prince as  and really couldn’t give good reasons like other people have done beffore you can’t be someone when you don’t even know who they are there will never be another michael jackson the man was seriously a once in a lifteime talent so stop with wanting to be the king of pop because you are simply not nor ever will be on his level reply ↓ summer on november   at  pm cancel reply sign in to

torokpatrickmcmullancomjustin bieber onetime and aspiring future monkey owner has had a new song leak continuing his recent streak of cool laidback rb grooves the track is called “oh girl” and it is about the ancient and sacred act of doing itwell ok it’s mostly about really liking a girl and there are no fully explicit references to intercourse but it’s pretty plain that the barely subtextual subject of the song is in fact the having of sex bumping smooshing knocking the proverbial boots humping if you want to be crass about it boffing screwing taking the light rail to pound town making the beast with two backs the irish ninemonther rutting the honeymoon hug the bishop’s visit fridaynight specialing straightup fucking whatever you want to call it really that’s what justin bieber’s song is aboutwith lyrics like “your body is so insane  making me call your name” and “it’s like a rush  every single time we touch” bieber is clearly singing to a young lady about their intimate moments but in a romantic way of course this isn’t some filthy paean to doing the nasty it’s a soulful rumination on the specialness of justin’s connection with one particular girl whether you would like to pretend you are that girl as you listen to the song closing your eyes and making a sad little whimpering gurgling sort of sound with your mouth while you sway back and forth well that’s
