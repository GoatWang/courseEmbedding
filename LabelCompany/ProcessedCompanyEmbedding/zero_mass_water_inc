atmospheric conditions in the second phase of the commitment in partnership with duke energy international dei zero mass labs commits to deploy to households in two communities one in peru and one in chile this phase will deploy to a total of twenty families with as many as eighty individuals supported by zmw systems this pilot deployment will provide valuable feedback on system performance and usage the third phase of the commitment involves the scaled deployment of systems to syrian refugees in jordan and jordanian families in need with financial support from the jordanian government zmw will deploy to up to  units by december  achieving this level of deployment will impact the lives of as many as  people these scaled deployments will produce over  million liters of drinking water per

second region background access to potable water is the biggest challenge facing humanity across the globe and across the socioeconomic spectrum there are three fundamental challenges to providing potable water access quality and security in many communities water is drawn from surface sources or from open wells that are frequently contaminated by pathogens the world health organization reports that  million people die per year from waterborne illnesses which translates to one person dying every  seconds from consuming this essential liquid in addition to quality challenges simply accessing water is a worldwide issue immense expenditures of time and effort are devoted to obtaining drinking water in africa alone  billion hours per year are spent walking to a water source unesco there are vast numbers of people across the middle east south america and asia that must have drinking water transported to them by truck when individuals in developing regions have to walk long distances sometimes through areas immersed in violent conflict go to a well that may be contaminated purchase water from a water truck or wait for an intermittent or unreliable governmental supply their level of water security is greatly limited zero mass labs sees an opportunity to use the inexhaustible supply of water vapor in the earths atmosphere to solve this problem in the region nearest the planets surface alone there is enough drinking water for all seven billion people on earth to survive for  years partnership opportunities seeking zero mass water seeks partners in two primary areas deployment partners these are entities with current operations incountry ideally those with ontheground resources for delivering and installing zmw systems at residential locations zmw is primarily interested in peru chile and jordan to begin with but is open to partners with especially strong operations in additional regions entities of all types are of interest local governments corporate partners ngos multilateral institutions and so on financial partners zmw seeks project or regionspecific philanthropic support to fund the initial construction and deployment of systems to those regions that could most benefit from the solution zmw also seeks lowcost working capital financing to fund the supply chain and enable economyofscale offering zmw will soon have a scalable solution for personal water production that could alter how humans obtain potable water all over the world zmw is interested in forming partnerships where it could offer a solution that is complementary to partner solutions already being deployed such as sustainable housing solar power solutions solar lanterns andor cook stove technologies amongst others explore more ways to take action commitment to

cody friesen might help zero mass water inc’s business first it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed the odds are higher that it will stay in the business
