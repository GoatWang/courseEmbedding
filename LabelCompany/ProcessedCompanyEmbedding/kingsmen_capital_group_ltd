going concern for a reasonable period of time the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern  the company ’ s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its

company will be successful in raising additional funds note  – income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasc  “ accounting for income taxes ”    under fasc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets will be reflected on the balance sheet when it is

securities and exchange commission on july        the company has evaluated all other subsequent events from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and determined there are no material transactions that have not been disclosed  item  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note regarding forwardlooking statements certain statements in this report constitute “ forwardlooking statements ”  such forwardlooking statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements factors that might cause such a difference include among others uncertainties relating to general economic and business conditions industry trends changes in demand for our products and services uncertainties relating to customer plans and commitments and the timing of orders received from customers announcements or changes in our pricing policies or that of our competitors unanticipated delays in the development market acceptance or installation of our products and services changes in government regulations availability of management and other key personnel availability terms and deployment of capital relationships with thirdparty equipment suppliers and worldwide political stability and economic growth the words “ believe ” “ expect ” “ anticipate ” “ intend ” and “ plan ” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date the statement was made critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes  management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions     kingsmen ’ s accounting policies are more fully described in note  of the audited financial statements in our recently filed form k  as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual differences could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  kingsmen believes that the following addresses kingsmen ’ s most critical accounting policies we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no  “ revenue recognition ”  “ sab  ”   under sab  revenue is recognized at the point of passage to the customer of title and risk of loss when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement the sales price is determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured our policy for our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers ’ inability to make required payments  if there is deterioration of our customers ’ credit worthiness andor there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used additional allowances may be required business overview through its whollyowned subsidiary zendex inc the company has been engaged in art brokering and has been in  the process of establishing an online marketing site to assist buyers and sellers of art by offering consignment and brokering services to artists and other sellers of art works   additional capital will be required to commence operations of the online marketing site as discussed more fully below on may   the company had a change of control and in conjunction with that change of control company management is exploring and considering new business opportunities   however although its operations have been dormant since the occurrence of the change of control as of the end of the quarter  covered by this report the company retained ownership of zendex inc its whollyowned operating subsidiary   liquidity and capital resources on june   kingsmen had current assets of  with liabilities of  we had negative working capital of  on june   on december   we had a negative working capital of   we will have to obtain additional capital to execute our business plan  our revenue was generated from art brokerage without additional capital we will not be able to execute on our business model   we anticipate the need for capital to help fund ongoing costs and do not believe debt financing will be available given the new direction we are taking with the business  we believe the online art business will prove to offer more opportunities and better profit margins than the current brokering business due to the ability of economies of scale not present in our current market  our current reliance on wordofmouth marketing will not be sufficient to support the successful implementation and growth of an online model results of operations for the six months ended june   kingsmen had  in revenues and  in general and administrative expenses  kingsmen had a net loss of  for the six months ended june    during the six months ended june   zendex had  in revenues with cost of sales of  resulting in a gross profit of   zendex ’ s general and administrative expenses for the six months ended june   were   zendex had net income for the six months ended june   of   with sporadic revenue and relatively set general and administrative costs we will need to generate additional sales if we are to be successful  for us to achieve profitability we will need to increase our volume of sales and have consistent sales revenue  currently we are limited to our ability to broker individual art works and by the time we pay commissions there is not sufficient revenue to cover our general and administrative expenses  we will need to either obtain better sources for art works being sold so we can increase our volume or look to alternative ways to bring buyers and sellers or art work together   we believe our future success is in our ability to generate an online site to broker paintings and other art work  we are still in the process of developing the site and the ultimate costs and revenue the site will generate are unknown at this time without prior experience in the online marketplace our ability to generate such a site is questionable   offbalance sheet arrangements the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements and it is not anticipated that the company will enter into any offbalance sheet arrangements subsequent events on may   the company had a change of control   on that date wei chi lim purchased a total of  of the company ’ s shares representing approximately  of its issued and outstanding common stock from certain shareholders  on the same date

representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “ forwardlooking ” including statements contained in this quarterly report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in reports to our company ’ s stockholders management believes that all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters as well as from developments beyond our company ’ s control including changes in global economic conditions are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the act these statements are made on the basis of management ’ s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made regarding future events and business performance there can be no assurance however that management ’ s expectations will necessarily come to pass factors that may affect forward looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance including the following changes in companywide strategies which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which our company is involved or chooses to invest changes in us global or regional economic conditions changes in us and global financial and equity markets including significant interest rate fluctuations which may impede our company ’ s access to or increase the cost of external financing for our operations and investments increased competitive pressures both domestically and internationally legal and regulatory developments such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes in international tax laws or currency controls adverse weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes labor disputes which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations this list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forwardlooking statements is illustrative but

condition and results of operations    special note regarding forward looking statements   certain statements in this report constitute “forwardlooking statements” such forwardlooking statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements factors that might cause such a difference include among others uncertainties relating to general economic and business conditions industry trends changes in demand for our products and services uncertainties relating to customer plans and commitments and the timing of orders received from customers announcements or changes in our pricing policies or that of our competitors unanticipated delays in the development market acceptance or installation of our products and services changes in government regulations availability of management and other key personnel availability terms and deployment of capital relationships with thirdparty equipment suppliers and worldwide political stability and economic growth the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” and “plan” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date the statement was made   critical accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   kingsmen’s accounting policies are more fully described in note  of the audited financial statements in our recently filed form k as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual differences could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions kingsmen believes that the following addresses kingsmen’s most critical accounting policies   we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no  “revenue recognition” “sab ” under sab  revenue is recognized at the point of passage to the customer of title and risk of loss when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement the sales price is determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured   our policy for our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers’ inability to make required payments if there is deterioration of our customers’ credit worthiness andor there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used additional allowances may be required          business overview   through its whollyowned subsidiary zendex inc the company has been engaged in art brokering and has been in the process of establishing an online marketing site to assist buyers and sellers of art by offering consignment and brokering services to artists and other sellers of art works additional capital will be required to commence operations of the online marketing site   on may   the company had a change of control on that date wei chi lim purchased a total of  of the company’s shares representing approximately  of its issued

the change of control was reported in a current report on form k dated may   and filed with the securities and exchange commission on may     on july   the company changed its name from zendex holdings inc to kingsmen capital group ltd the name change was reported in a current report on form k dated july   and filed with the securities and exchange commission on july     liquidity and capital resources   on september   kingsmen had current assets of  with liabilities of  we had negative working capital of  on september   on december   we had a negative working capital of  we will have to obtain additional capital to execute our business plan our revenue was generated from art brokerage without additional capital we will not be able to execute on our business model   we anticipate the need for capital to help fund ongoing costs and do not believe debt financing will be available given the new direction we are taking with the business we believe the online art business will prove to offer more opportunities and better profit margins than the current brokering business due to the ability of economies of scale not present in our current market our current reliance on wordofmouth marketing will not be sufficient to support the successful implementation and growth of an online model   results of operations   for the nine months ended september   kingsmen had  in revenues and  in general and administrative expenses kingsmen had a net loss of  for the nine months ended september   during the nine months ended september   zendex had  in revenues with cost of sales of  resulting in a gross profit of  zendex’s general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended september   were  zendex had a net loss for the nine months ended september   of  with sporadic revenue and relatively set general and administrative costs we will need to generate additional sales if we are to be successful for us to achieve profitability we will need to increase our volume of sales and have consistent sales revenue currently we are limited to our ability to broker individual art works and by the time we pay commissions there is not sufficient revenue to cover our general and administrative expenses we will need to either obtain better sources for art works being sold so we can increase our volume or look to alternative ways to bring buyers and sellers or art work together we believe our future success is in our ability to generate an online site to broker paintings and other art work we are still in the process of developing the site and the ultimate costs and revenue the site will generate are unknown at this time without prior experience in the online marketplace our ability to generate such a site is questionable   offbalance sheet arrangements   the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements and it is not anticipated that the company will enter into any offbalance sheet arrangements           forwardlooking statements   our company and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forwardlooking” including statements contained in this quarterly report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in reports to our company’s stockholders management believes that all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters as well as from developments beyond our company’s control including changes in global economic conditions are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the act these statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made regarding future events and business performance there can be no assurance however that management’s expectations will necessarily come to pass factors that may affect forward looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance including the following   changes in companywide strategies which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which our company is involved or chooses to invest changes in us global or regional economic conditions changes in us and global financial and equity markets including significant interest rate fluctuations which may impede our company’s access to or increase the cost of external financing for our operations and investments increased competitive pressures both domestically and internationally legal and regulatory developments such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes in international tax laws or currency controls adverse weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes labor disputes which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations   this list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forwardlooking statements is illustrative but by no means exhaustive accordingly all forwardlooking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty   item  quantitative and qualitative
