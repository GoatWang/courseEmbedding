successful leadership model under which the chief executive officer of eaton corporation also serves as chairman of the board of the company recognizing that different leadership models may work well for other companies at different times depending upon individual circumstances we believe that our company has been well served by the combined chief executive officer and chairman leadership structure and that this approach has continued to be highly effective with the addition of a lead director we believe we have greatly benefited from having a chairman who sets the tone and direction

leadership experience represented on our board of directors the board evaluates the leadership structure annually and it will continue to do so as circumstances change including when a new chief executive officer is elected in its february  annual evaluation the board concluded that the current leadership structure — under which the chief executive officer of eaton corporation serves as chairman of the board of the company our board committees are chaired by independent directors and a lead director assumes specific responsibilities on behalf of the independent directors — remains the optimal board leadership structure for our company and our shareholders at the present time lead director — ned c lautenbach who has served on eaton’s board since  was first elected lead director by our independent directors in  the lead director has specific responsibilities including chairing meetings of the board at which the chairman is not present including executive sessions of the board
