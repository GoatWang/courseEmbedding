foundations vs donor advised funds – integration of charitable aspirations in legacy and estate planning – peer‐based perspectives on multigenerational philanthropy – annual charitable gift planning – consultation on socially responsible and impact investments case studies family foundation vs donor advised fund estate planning socially responsible investment portfolio a secondgeneration member of a wealthy family stewarded her family’s private foundation which served as their primary giving vehicle for over a decade the family began to realize that the foundation’s management and administrative costs were an increasing burden and wanted to explore alternative options  hillview conducted a detailed costbenefit comparison of the private foundation and donoradvised fund models this assessment took into account the overall management requirements administrative expenses and payout requirements associated with each option  we also confirmed that each option would provide sufficient flexibility in how she executed the family’s giving strategies after extensive consultation with family members hillview recommended that they establish a donor advised fund as a highly costeffective solution requiring minimal changes to the family’s philanthropic aspirations prompted by a client’s request to comment on his and his wife’s life insurance hillview assessed the policies’ role with respect to the family’s income replacement needs and wealth transfer objectives  in the course of our consultation hillview found that the client was “overinsured” and that his wife’s policy was both costly and misaligned with the family’s needs  more importantly we uncovered several material shortcomings with the family’s estate plans  these red flags indicated the need for a comprehensive and coordinated estate planning assessment and design  hillview assumed the role of quarterbacking a teamoriented approach involving the client’s life insurance professional te attorney and accountant the outcome of our work was  an updated estate plan aligned with the client’s wealth preservation and transfer goals  establishment of revocable trusts to avoid probate and to maintain family’s privacy  replacement of existing life insurance with more suitable policies that had preferential pricing and flexible terms  increased and segregated funding for the children’s educational expenses the most significant outcome however was our client’s expressed “peace of mind” that his wealth will transfer upon his passing in a manner that provides for longterm financial security for his family our client was interested in aligning her investments with her values and asked us for guidance she completed a survey to establish socially responsible investment sri screens after several consultations a prototype portfolio was designed using both positive and negative screening methodologies while targeting a riskreturn profile aligned with her custom benchmark the prototype sri portfolio was benchmarked against a custom global benchmark –  sp  index   sp adr index the recommended portfolio excluded oil gas and coal companies that are major suppliers of fossil fuels and companies that facilitate the production and transportation of fossil fuels major chemical companies tobacco companies weapons manufacturers and nuclear power generators were among the exclusions beyond the fossil fuel universe the portfolio also favored companies that receive high scores in an environmental social and governance ranking system with emphasis placed on companies that contribute to improving the sustainability of the global economy
