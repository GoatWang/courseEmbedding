view all what is the cellmist™ system the cellmist™ system is an innovative investigational medical treatment for processing and spraying a patient’s own stem cells onto wounds for rapid healing the cellmist™ system is comprised of two primary components the cellmist™ solution a liquid suspension containing a patient’s own stem cells which are isolated from a small sample of their skin using a patented process the skingun™ a patented investigational medical device which gently sprays the cellmist™ solution on to a wound site for rapid healing once sprayed onto the wound site the patient’s stem cells contained in the cellmist™ solution go to work naturally and rapidly regenerating damaged skin the cellmist™ system replaces traditional skin grafts harvested through painful surgery to remove significant portions of skin from the donor’s body  these graft surgeries create large secondary wounds the cellmist™ system requires only a postage stampsized sample of donor skin what is the skingun™ our patented skingun™ is an investigational spray device specially designed to deliver the cellmist™ solution and its regenerative stem cells to heal burns and wounds stem cells are delicate and can be easily damaged by conventional spray methods  these pumps use mechanical compression generating turbulent forces which can thrash and damage the cells in contrast the skingun™ is an ultragentle sprayer which delicately carries the patient’s own stem cells to wound sites  we make use of a novel positivepressure system engineered to avoid violent forces how does the cellmist™ system work the cellmist™ system sprays a patient’s own stem cells onto wounds naturally regenerating skin to heal traumatic wounds quicker than traditional therapies first a patient’s cells are liberated from a small sample of skin often as little as a postage stamp  these naturally potent cells are collected in a waterbased liquid called the cellmist™ solution next the cellmist™ solution is sprayed gently onto the wounded area using our patented investigational skingun™ this procedure takes as little as  minutes from start to finish in some cases patients can leave the hospital within a few days rather than the many weeks required by alternative treatments what conditions does the cellmist™ system treat the cellmist™ system has been used in experimental procedures to treat severe seconddegree burns our future target markets include chronic wounds vitiligo areas of unpigmented skin scars and other skin disorders which collectively account for a  billion market and  million patients where is cellmist™ treatment available the cellmist™ system is under development and has only been used in experimental protocols on a very limited basis  our technologies are not currently available for use or treatment in the united states what is the liquid sprayer for wound care and irrigation fluids renovacare’s solution spray deposition device was designed to meet a specific clinical need liquid spraying such as saline solution spraying to cleanse a wound to irrigate a wound or to maintain a moist wound environment is clinically desirable in surgery while saline and other woundwetting solutions’ distribution over burns and other wounds is typically performed by pouring the liquid or squirting with a standard syringe renovacare has developed a device that sprays gently and evenly over a large wound area stock information visit the investor dashboard for more detailed information renovacare otcqbrcar price  volume sign up for investor alerts sign up for investor

autologous selfdonated stem cell therapies for the regeneration of human organs our initial products under development target the body’s largest organ the skin our flagship technology the cellmist™

cellmist™ system as a promising new alternative for patients suffering from burns chronic and acute wounds and scars in the us alone this  billion market is greater than spending on highblood pressure management cholesterol treatments and back pain therapeutics currently in investigational clinical use for second degree burn patients in the united states our cellmist™ system targets an estimated  million patients worldwide who suffer burns chronic and acute wounds acne scarring and skin defects and diseases such as vitiligo a skin discoloration condition suffered by celebrities michael jackson and jon hamm according to the national institutes of health skin disorders account for  of occupationaldisease claims nationally for patients the potential breakthrough of a quickhealing gentle mist of their own stem cells will be a promising alternative to conventional skin grafts which can be extremely painful slowtoheal and prone to complications the cellmist™ system harvests a patient’s stem cells from a small area of skin generally around  square inch and suspends them in the waterbased cellmist™ solution the suspension is delicately sprayed onto the wound using the skingun™ deposition device where it begins to grow new skin at the cellular level renovacare’s skingun™ spray device is the world’s most advanced technology of its kind using a gentle positivepressure air stream to spray the cellmist™ solution onto wounds this is a marked improvement over pump spray devices which spray by creating high pressure behind a narrow aperture and expose fragile cells to strong forces that are likely to tear them apart this procedure can take as little as  minutes from start to finish in some cases patients will be able to leave the hospital within only a few days rather than the many weeks required by other alternative treatments such as invitro cultured epithelial grafts go to top  join the rcar vip listdont miss out  get the latest news first join the rcar vip list renovacare

cell systems gmbh berlin germany” we’ve witnessed just under  during the past week in terms of shareholder gains in the listing but that move comes in the context of a larger bearish trend market participants may want to pay attention to this stock rcar has a history of dramatic rallies what’s more the name has seen a recent influx of interest with the stock’s recent average trading volume running  beyond what we have been seeing over the larger time frame it pays to take note of this fact due to the limited float size in the stock just a tad more than m shares traders should not overlook this combination as a jump in average daily transaction volume in a stock with a restricted float can unleash fireworks as supply is squeezed currently trading at a market capitalization of m rcar has a decent store k of cash on the books with total assets greater than k which compares with very little total accumulated debt the exposure is great and the company can certainly benefit however eventually this will likely have to reconciled with government oversight on some level and we will see this product put to the test for now however this is a very interesting story generating

otcqbrcar today announced a partnership to validate the science behind its groundbreaking technology for treatments of wounds burns and other skin defects the company’s research partner is berlinbrandenburg center for regenerative therapies bcrt a translational research center at charité  universitätsmedizin berlin one of the world’s largest university hospitals the bcrt focuses on enhancing endogenous regeneration by cells biomaterials and factors which can be used to develop and implement innovative therapies and products renovacare inc is the developer of the patented cellmist™ and skingun™ technologies for isolating and spraying a patient’s own stem cells onto burns and wounds for rapid selfhealing “this collaboration with a globallyrenowned institution is a huge step forward for renovacare as we set out to achieve third party validation of the science behind the promise of our cellmist™ and skingun™ technologies” said thomas bold president and ceo of renovacare inc “we are honored to be working with such committed researchers known for partnering with innovative worldclass companies whose mission is to make peoples’ lives better” “we are very excited to be working with renovacare to advance the treatment of burns and this project underscores the new treatments for severely burned patients and those with myriad skin conditions” said dr katrin zeilinger project leader for bcrt “we plan to assess all aspects of the company’s technology as it is related to the tissue’s woundhealing function and the characteristics of the treated site” the objective of today’s announced research partnership is to evaluate protocols methods and outcomes related to the use of the renovacare proprietary skingun™ this includes better understanding the ability of delicate stem cells to survive and grow after being gently sprayed through skingun™ on to targeted body sites survival of these cells is vital to wound healing and recovery according to renovacare engineers the company’s proprietary skingun™ spray device is the world’s most advanced technology of its kind using an ultragentle nonturbulent air stream to spray the cells onto wounds this is a marked improvement over pump spray devices which create highpressure forces behind a narrow aperture exposing fragile cells to thrashing that is more likely to cause damage scientists at bcrt will also study various additional features and behaviors related to skin stem cells and their ability to replicate and grow for wound healing about charité – universitätsmedizin berlin with a total of  beds charité – universitätsmedizin berlin is one of the largest university hospitals in europe charité spans four campuses and comprises approximately  departments and institutes the areas

its patented cellmist and skingun stem cell technologies for treating burns in weeks or less as well as treating chronic and acute wounds acne scarring and skin defects and diseases in december it received a us patent for its skingun device before joining renovacare ceo thomas bold was ceo of stemcell systems he has more than  years of experience in medical biotechnology device manufacturing and stem cell platform development harlan levy how does your cellmist technology specifically work thomas bold doctors isolate a high concentration of the most desirable stem cell population from a very small donor sample of the patients own skin and suspended in the liquid cellmist solution its then gently sprayed onto wound sites using our skingun which looks like captain kirks particlebeam gun the phaser in the star trek tv series the isolated cells include cells that proliferate rapidly in order to achieve quick reepithelialization this is the stage at which a burn is technically considered healed and patients are often discharged the average person would recognize this healing phase as the point at which the wound develops a thin shiny pinkcolored protective layer hl what are existing burn treatments and how do they compare with the skingun treatment tb traditional skin grafting has been the treatment for burns and wounds for centuries more recently mesh grafting has become the latest standard of care this process surgically removes large sheets of healthy skin from the patient following this painful donor procedure the sheet is punctured in a gridlike pattern to form an expandable mesh surgeons pull this mesh as wide as feasible and surgically stitch this skin to the patients wound the procedure is extremely painful creates an additional wound at each donor site and results in poor cosmetic outcomes often with scarred and deformed skin this transplanted skin can result in restricted joint movement and is unable to grow with the patient consequently mesh graft patients require months and sometimes up to a year of physical therapy and can face psychological problems from the permanent disfigurement of scarring in addition longterm pain management with painkillers is very often necessary with the renovacare treatment technology by spraying the patients stem cells the skingun overcomes the need for removing large sheets of donor skin and the resultant healing does not require prolonged physical therapy the spray procedure is gentle and the skin that regrows looks feels and functions as the original skin that it replaces most often the healing process takes only a week its very important to note here that a sheet of meshed skin covers only up to six times its original donor area the renovacare system covers up to  times its donor skin sample this is why the donor skin sample can be so small compared to the injured treatment area hl what about scars and infection potential compared with conventional treatments tb a wound heals from the edges towards the middle the bigger the wound the longer this process takes and the longer this process takes the higher the risk of infection and scarring imagine a large burn of    percent of your total body surface with our cellmist system the doctor sprays the patients own stem cells with a highly regenerative capacity onto the wound and by doing so creates tens of thousands of little regenerative islands across the wound these islands grow outwards ultimately connecting to each other to create a protective epithelial skin layer that covers the wound experts believe the formation of this pinkcolored layer marks the moment of reepithelization where the risk of infection is reduced and the patients wound is effectively healed beyond this stage the cosmetic healing process also happens entirely natural to produce a scarfree result where finally skin color tone and pigmentation are restored since the renovacare spray procedure uses the patients own stem cells there isnt the risk of tissue rejection infection or ongoing immuno suppression therapy hl what results have you found for patients using the skingun tb we have many examples of patients recovering from severe burns within a week or two scarfree and walking away with unlimited joint restrictions in the case of one patient with severe electrical burns to over a third of his body we were able to spray his wounds with  million stem cells isolated from a tiny twoinchby twoinch sample of his own skin within five days of treatment his chest and arms were already healed four days later the patient was discharged from the hospital its also important to note that reconstructive surgery for burn patients is especially challenging when tackling joints in the body to this end the authors of a case study in the reputable journal burns said cellspray grafting is also especially suitable for hands and joint areas where prolonged times to reepithelization may significantly impact functionality and esthetic outcome hl what different uses does the skingun have beside burns tb currently we are focusing on severe seconddegree burns but we see the renovacare technology also applicable for other indications such as cosmetic procedures targeting skin pigmentation disorders scar treatment and other related conditions our goal is to bring to market the worlds most advanced technology for skin repair using a patients own stem cells hl is there a record of the skingun™ use in the states and abroad tb having treated  burn patients to date the companys early clinical target is burns with followon indications including chronic wounds and cosmetic procedures hl how much research went into creating the skingun and over what time period tb the birth of renovacare technology goes back to the early s in berlin germany researchers at that time were trying to grow skin by seeding stem cells inside multidimensional bioreactors they soon discovered that these artificial chambers were no match for the growth of the same cells when transplanted inside a human body thus the birth of a concept to use a patients own wound as a natural bioreactor a study published in advances in plastic surgery highlights  early patients with deep dermal wound burns to the face and neck complex threedimensional surfaces researchers achieved such outstanding results using our cell spray that they refused to perform further skin grafting instead surgeons adopted our founding technology as their standard of care let me quote from the surgeons study which states we refuse to perform a prospective randomized study with groups in which traditional skin grafting andor wound healing are still applied for the therapy for deep dermal burns due to the excellent results in our study the method of cea spray application has become our standard of care for these indications the faster wound closure the promotion of spontaneous wound healing by keratinocyte application as well as the preservation of donor sites are further advantages of the method the same paper concluded that using a spray technique results in excellent cosmetic outcomes compared with any other method hl how has the technology changed since then tb since the time of this early approach our technology has evolved and matured significantly our cell isolation no longer requires complex procedures culturing expansion and processing time and our stem cell spray device no longer requires multiple handassembled parts its independent power and flowcontrol unit has been condensed in size from a foot cube down to a volt battery placed inside the handle of a single handheld spray gun hl what is the potential market for the technology in dollars and number of patients tb conservatively speaking the market for our technology exceeds  billion there are nearly a million people who suffer from burns each year in the us alone according to the american burn association burn injuries continue to be one of the leading causes of accidental death and injury in the us and one civilian fire death occurs every two hours and forty minutes hl how much would you estimate the treatment cost may be for each different use tb the skingun technology is currently under development and not approved for clinical use in the us so its too early to talk about what the treatment will cost we have always been mindful of reimbursement and nearly two years ago we commissioned an investigation into the reimbursement pathway for our cellmist system we know that reimbursement opportunities are available by way of current coding and practices we have further investigated and evaluated the bundling approach currently advocated for by insurers and are confident that that our technology is well placed to take advantages of any shift towards such a model hl what is the schedule to get federal drug administration clearance tb in order to achieve fda clearance for the cellmist system and the skingun we will be working to show our technology is safe and prove its efficacy within applicable clinical trial formats and according to the relevant regulatory requirements i cant speculate as to how long the fda clearance process will take and therefore its hard to speculate when our product will be commercialized hl what other products are you investigating and how may they work tb we are focusing on bringing the skingun™ and our stem cell spray technology to market at this time hl what is your background including age education prior employment tb before joining renovacare i worked as the ceo of stemcell systems gmbh a berlinbased biomedical company engaged in the development and commercialization of advanced cell culture bioreactors i have more than  years of professional business experience in the field of medical biotechnology device manufacturing stem cell culture technology platform development and regenerative medicine research project management and product development i also cofounded several startup companies in germany

applying salves normally he would be in the burn unit for weeks or months going through the same agonizing process twice a day instead a team of specialists goes to work with a new technique they harvest a layer of healthy cells from unburned patches of his own skin no cadaver skin for matt “ before long a spray gun is gently painting the wounds with a solution of matt’s own stem cells “three days later his arms and face were completely healed and this miracle has to be seen to be believed” beyond medicine why we do what we do the goal is to bring our stem cell technologies to the  million patients worldwide who suffer burns chronic and acute wounds acne scarring and skin defects and diseases our mission is to help these patients by replacing painful skin grafts with we believe the greatest breakthrough in wound healing in the past halfcentury – a gentle mist of stem cells remember within only two hours of arriving in an emergency room matt’s own stem cells were sprayed on to his burns using the skingun™ a few days later he walked out of the hospital as matt explains it “when i had the procedure they sprayed me on a friday it was hard to believe that i was walking out that monday completely healed no scarring no pain” since matt’s treatment we’ve worked harder than ever to miniaturize and advanceengineer the early prototypes of our skingun™ into a marketready product our push is to eliminate painful and disfiguring skin graft surgeries reduce hospital stays and minimize pain and infections our path ahead if the year we leave behind was one of creating and building our technologies then the road ahead in  is all about clarity in advancing and bringing it to market our patents regulatory strategy clinical outcomes and brandbuilding are key initiatives for the year ahead i believe that each of these will advance our business and build shareholder value the issuance of our latest skingun™ device patent bolsters our intellectual property portfolio provides important protection of our invention and gives us commercial confidence to move forward with engineering and internal documentation work largely behind us we’re more excited than ever to move forward
