alphasign in  join nowgo»stampscom ecommerce is the keymay  about stampscom inc stmp the bull case long only shortterm horizon mediumterm horizon longterm horizonsummarystampscom has been diversifying its product offerings over the years the financial situation of the company is sound and the business model will provide strong results going forward the growth of ecommerce will greatly benefit the company despite competition stampscom continues to grow at a rapid pace investment thesis i believe that stampscom will continue to experience growth due to a rapidly growing ecommerce economy and significant room for expansion the company has been embarking on a journey of diversification and is now well positioned to benefit from macroeconomic trends i will first give you an overview of the company and its various services in order to highlight how the companys offerings are now more suitable for the future than they have been in the past furthermore i will discuss the companys attractive financials before touching on the competition and some potential risks company overview founded in  stampscom provides its customers with online postage solutions the company is chiefly partnered with the united states postal service and was the first company to ever become a usps approved pc postage vendor through their online services the company allows customers from individuals to large enterprises to print postage using standard printers and an internet connection stampscom nasdaqstmp operates in a single reportable segment internet mailing and shipping solutions this segment encompasses the entirety of the companys core postage solutions business and can be broken down into the following five brands stampscom  usps mailing and shipping solutions endicia  usps mailing and shipping solutions shipstation  webbased multicarrier shipping solutions shipworks  clientbased multicarrier shipping solutions shippingeasy  webbased multicarrier shipping solutions services looking more in depth at the companys services it is clear that stampscom has been attempting to diversify its offerings to support customer demands for other shipping carriers in addition to usps lets take a look at what the targeted customer segments of each brand are and what they add to the overall business stampscom is the original service that brought about online postage solutions customers pay a monthly subscription service fee and the cost of postage albeit at a discounted rate when comparing prices directly to usps almost all of the types of envelopes packages etc that usps offers are supported through the site stampscom also has a variety of features that make it attractive to higher volume shippers and businesses one of the most important is the ability of the service to automate many aspects of the shipping process including automatic addressing prefilled forms and batch printing endicia was acquired by stampscom on november   and is one of the few other companies that is also a usps approved pc postage company stampscom purchased endicia in order to expand its offerings for high volume and large enterprise customers endicia is the leading provider of high volume usps shipping solutions due to its database integration automation support and high volume shipping software product integration capabilities shipstation which was acquired on june   marked stampscoms first foray into supporting other carriers over  different carriers are supported including ups nyseups fedex nysefdx and dhl private making the service attractive to customers who avoided stampscom limitedness to only usps shipstation is primarily an ecommerce shipping solution and has over  partner integrations that allow sellers on sites like amazon nasdaqamzn and etsy nasdaqetsy to directly utilize the service without leaving their platforms like shipstation shipworks acquired on august   also supports a variety of shipping carriers and has partner integrations the primary differentiator for this service lies in its support for more complex shipping solutions as clientbased software solutions to issues such as international customs forms return shipping labels etc are able to easily be handled lastly shippingeasy is another service focused on ecommerce merchants with support for multiple carriers and partner integrations shippingeasy also offers product management support for its customers this makes the service especially valuable to small businesses that are just starting up financials the companys business model results in strong cash flows due to the recurring revenue streams from its subscriptions service revenues defined by the company as revenues derived from subscriptions plans usps compensation for waived service fees and transaction related revenues comprised  of the companys total revenues in  as can be seen in the graph below total revenues have been seeing strong growth thanks in large part to the companys multiple acquisitions over the years furthermore the number of annual paid customers continues to grow as the churn rate continues to decrease in  the number of annual paid customers rose to  representing a  yearoveryear increase at the same time the annual average paid customer churn rate fell to a low of only  stampscom operates an extremely high margin business due to the digital nature of the services it provides and the lack of significant costs of revenues since customers print their own labels and postage costs associated with printing and ink replacements do not impact the company in  total gross margin stood at  according to gaap standards with a short interest ratio hovering around  stampscom is one of the most highly shorted stocks on the market conditions like this create the perfect opportunity for a short squeeze amid a newly authorized  million share repurchase plan over the next six months the stock has continued to climb higher recently for reasons that i will discuss in just a bit future catalysts could potentially trigger a short squeeze and further add to the buying pressure the company has been facing growth opportunity as i discussed in my article how to play the future of retail online business and ecommerce is expected to continue growing at a rapid pace going into the future in  online and nonstore sales are expected to triple the growth rate of brick and mortar stores by  worldwide ecommerce sales are projected to top  trillion the growth of ecommerce will play a critical role in the companys earnings going forward as more and more shopping is performed online instead of in person the number of packages that need to be shipped will rise accordingly while it may be difficult to choose which specific shipping companies will benefit the most from this trend stampscom will benefit regardless through the companys diversification efforts they are no longer dependent on the success of just usps but rather shipping carriers as a whole stampscom also has significant room for expansion within the current market annual postage printed in dollar terms reached  billion in  yet represents only  of the top four carriers revenue as shown in the chart below according to the small business administration there are currently  million small businesses in the united states with only  customers as of q the potential customer growth is enormous competition stampscom faces competition from a variety of sources despite postage for usps being the core business usps also represents one of the companys largest competitors customers and businesses that go directly to the post office can pay for postage there essentially cutting stampscom out of the equation this issue also occurs with other shipping companies that have retail locations such as ups fedex and dhl however customers who do so stand to pay a higher price than they would on stampscom the most direct competitor that stampscom faces is pitney bowes nysepbi another usps approved pc postage vendor in addition to offering a similar service of online postage solutions pitney bowes also sells traditional postage meters while postage meters can provide an individual or business with a faster processing time they do not offer the same degree of automation and integration that stampscom does risks ecommerce platforms as a greater number of ecommerce platforms begin to emerge online many may begin to form their own shipping services by integrating directly with carriers this would essentially cut stampscom out as the middleman since customers engaged in the ecommerce business will likely only want to deal with one central platform for their business needs usps vendor status changes stampscom is able to offer discounts to its customers as a result of its usps approved pc postage vendor status if this status was to be terminated or the discounts associated with the status changed stampscom could be adversely affected economic downturn stampscom is disproportionally vulnerable to economic downturns compared to the typical business if a recession were to occur global shipping would decrease and the companys profits would be hurt immensely conclusion due to the companys efforts to diversify its service offerings stampscom is well positioned to experience explosive growth as ecommerce continues to grow the company has moved away from its reliance on usps and is now able to benefit from the success of the shipping industry as a whole additionally the relatively small market penetration the company currently has allows for significant expansion the financial situation is sound and an increasing share price may be beginning to put the massive amount of short sellers on edge despite competitive threats stampscoms ability to create value for its customers by saving them time and money will continue to be a primary driving force for years to come disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
