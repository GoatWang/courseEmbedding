 frontfour capital group llc and zelman capital llc significant shareholders of intertape polymer group inc tsx itp announced today that they have delivered a letter to the president and ceo of ipg the full text of which is set out below november  mr gregory ac yullpresident and ceointertape polymer group inc  paramount drive suite sarasota fl  cc the board of directors intertape polymer group inc dear greg as you are aware frontfour capital group llc frontfour and zelman capital llc zelman have been significant shareholders of intertape polymer group inc ipg or the company for the last several years  we own approximately  and  million shares respectively collectively representing  of ipgs total shares outstanding we were each attracted to ipgs stock after conducting significant due diligence which supported the investment thesis that a combination of i a us economic recovery ii ipgs improving margin profile due to sku rationalization iii lower operating costs including the transition to the newly constructed blythewood sc facility iv returns of capital via dividends and share repurchases and v more recently lower input costs due to energy complex weakness would collectively drive significant cashflow and earnings growth  we also believe that ipg is a highly attractive acquisition candidate due to its strong market position within its product lines  we write this letter to you and the board of directors as we believe that ipgs shares are worth approximately cad  per share representing upside of  to the current market price  additionally we strongly believe that ipg is a highly sought after strategic asset that would garner a significant premium from either a strategic buyer or private equity sponsor with a preexisting portfolio company within the packaging space  in summary we believe that there are a number of steps that management can take to unlock value while we acknowledge that ipgs operations and financial position have significantly improved over the last five years the companys shares now trade at a significant management discount and the stock has become a showme story this dynamic exists due to recent company missteps including the downward revision of fourth quarter  earnings stemming from manufacturing issues and the more recent delay of full production by  months at the blythewood sc tape production facility as a result ipgs shares currently trade at x e ebitda and a  free cash flow yield based on street consensus estimates representing a material discount to its north american packaging peers x ebitda and  fcf yield based on  estimates the valuation discount is just as dramatic as forecasted margins reflect the full benefit from blythewood plant productivity savings with ipg shares trading at x ebitda and a  free cash flow yield versus x and  for the peer group given the companys strong position with  of sales derived from products with a  or  market share in their respective categories us centric revenue base attractive margin profile and commensurate free cash flow generation this discount is unwarranted  we believe that there are a number of immediate actions that the company must take to close this valuation gap including i increasing net leverage to x e net debtebitda to repurchase additional shares ii improving disclosure relating to ipgs capital expenditure plan iii pursuing a listing on a usbased stock exchange and commensurate us equity analyst coverage and iv refreshing the board of directors to include individuals with us packaging industry experience based on our discussions with numerous shareholders of ipg we believe that a significant percentage of the shareholder base is supportive of these actions  we urge you and the board of directors to take the following actions immediately i increase net leverage to repurchase additional shares – we appreciate the opportunity set the company has in terms of incremental bolton acquisitions and are supportive of your acquisition strategy we also applaud your recent stock buyback activity of over  million shares repurchased since  yet we continue to believe that the company is overcapitalized with equity  as you recently articulated the pipeline of potential bolton acquisitions for ipg represents a total purchase price of  million  in the unlikely scenario where you were able to execute on all of these transactions assuming a x aggregate purchase multiple  financed with debt the companys net leverage would increase from x to approximately x thus still leaving you with ample capacity to meaningfully increase share repurchases at ipgs current valuation of x e ebitda the company has the ability to borrow at rates under  to repurchase ipg shares which are trading at a dividend yield and free cash flow yield of approximately  and  respectively – this would be highly accretive to shareholders  we believe that management should take net leverage to x e ebitda which would still allow the company ample debt capacity to pursue its bolton acquisition strategy  we also note that leverage would come back down to approximately x e ebitda within  months in this scenario due to ebitda growth and free cash generation after dividends ii improve disclosure relating to capital expenditures­ – on the fourth quarter  earnings conference call held in march  you stated that ipgs estimated annual maintenance capex is generally between  and  million and continue to reiterate  capital expenditure guidance of  to  million apart from an incremental  million of capital earmarked to finish the ramp at the new south carolina plant earlier this year the remaining bucket of capital expenditures beyond maintenance has been dedicated by company management to vaguelyoutlined highreturn projects additionally the company has guided that it will incur approximately  million of total capital expenditures for each of the next few years however the disclosure surrounding where the growth capital expenditures will be allocated and the corresponding return profile associated with such expenditures has been nonexistent we would like the management team to provide increased disclosure regarding the return profile timing and scope of the future projects quantifying the marginearnings uplift from future outlays will allow investors and sellside analysts to properly model these investments iii pursue listing on a usbased stock exchange – in addition to deriving most of its revenue from the united states  ipg also has the majority of its manufacturing footprint located in the united states  of net ppe the company reports in us dollars and its executive headquarters is located in sarasota fl this profile makes ipgs shares a natural fit to be duallisted on a usbased exchange where it would receive increased coverage from usbased analysts who cover a much larger universe of packaging companies relative to their canadian counterparts a larger institutional following in the united states would not only allow investors to benchmark ipgs favorable operating and financial metrics versus usbased peers but also likely increase the stocks liquidity both increased analyst coverage and liquidity will lead to multiple expansion iv refreshing ipgs board of directors with independent packaging industry expertise – as the board is currently constituted there is a glaring lack of packaging industry expertise we believe that the company would benefit from the addition of several new directors with packaging industry experience to provide strategic guidance on positioning the company for growth and broader operational execution   north american packaging peer universe includes bemis company bms crown holdings cck sealed air see avery dennison avy berry plastics bery and ccl industries ccl cn pro forma ipg equity valuation to illustrate the positive impact through increasing net leverage modestly and repurchasing shares we point to the calculation below usd in millions except where noted e wall street consensus ebitda  e wall street consensus ebitda  recommended net leverage ratio x total pro forma net debt  e ebitda x total pro forma net debt  less estimated current net debt   e wall street consensus free cash flow  incremental capacity for share repurchase  incremental aftertax interest expense   e pro forma free cash flow  assumed repurchase price cad  pf share count  cadusd exchange rate  assumed repurchase price usd  e fcf per share  north american packaging peer group fcf yield  repurchased shares  target price usd  target price cad  estimated current share count    upside to current ipg stock price  pf share count  e wall street consensus ebitda  implied ev  ebitda multiple x e wall street consensus ebitda  implied ev  ebitda multiple x  reflects net debt at  of  million plus incremental debt incurred to fund  million of share repurchases during august september and october   per sedi regulatory filings plus consensus free cash flow estimate generated during same period  represents  share count of  million less  million shares repurchased during august september and october of  per sedi regulatory filings  assumes corporate tax rate of  and interest rate on incremental debt of  we believe the pursuit of the recommendations outlined in this letter along with strong execution at the blythewood plant will lift the valuation of the company an appropriately valued equity currency will give you the option to issue shares in an accretive manner should a larger acquisitions opportunity present itself  over the last few years of our respective stock ownership we have enjoyed a constructive dialogue with ipgs management team while we have considerable experience effecting shareholderfriendly strategic actions by directly seeking board representation through the solicitation of proxies we do not believe that such action is necessary at this time we hope to continue this rapport and would like to see you implement our recommendations as we strongly believe that doing so will create significant shareholder value  sincerely   frontfour capital group llc                                   zelman capital
