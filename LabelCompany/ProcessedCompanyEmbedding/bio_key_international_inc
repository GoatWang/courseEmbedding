pm re seanboy post  post  of   typically a rep agency will handle products from many different manufacturers the key in hiring and engaging a rep agency is finding agencies that have synergy in the product lines they carry customers both oem and user along with complementary products that they handle now that biokey is playing in both the oem user and consumer market there may be a need to have two different styles of rep agencies representing the company one that focuses on oem and user and the other with that focuses on consumer retail the oem and user rep would typically be charged with developing the industrial and electronic distribution channel consumer will develop the retail distribution channel along with the web based sales they are typically handled very differently i continue to struggle with the reason why we have not engaged rep agencies to handle our products it essentially cost us anywhere between five and  of the sale but by doing so you do not need to have a direct sales force expense which would be quite significant for our company primarily you use sales management personnel like regional managers to develop the rep agencies and the rep agency develops the sales channels as well as target markets and oems it would be by far the most costeffective way to take our product to market and develop a wide range of customers opportunities ihub newswire

biokey platform more flexible and less expensive to deploy in the market biokeys patented webkey platform is used to securely release authentication data from the secure zone of a device eg smartphone to a network environment including the internet or the cloud where it can be processed more securely than on the device no other technology enables both on device authentication with any fingerprint sensor and enables identification capabilities in databases that reside in the cloud as a result biokeys capabilities are applicable to the entire spectrum of authentication security required by industry stakeholders according to the verizon enterprise services  breach report  of all hacking attempts include the exploitation of weak user authentication technologies thus to solve the rapid rise of hacking experienced by the likes of home depot nysehd paypal nasdaqpypl target nysetgt apple nasdaqaapl and others a global upgrade of user authentication technologies has begun this is evidenced by apple samsung snllf and other handset manufacturers adoption of fingerprint technologies in their smart phones the gartner group has recently placed biometrics in the early stages of what they call a hype cycle in the digital banking sector their definition of the digital banking hype cycle is focused on potentially gamechanging technologies as stated in the gartner group august th digital banking hype cycle research biometric mobile banking authentication is one of the four game changing technologies just beginning the hype cycle as they call it biometric mobile banking authentication  this describes the reuse of ondevice biometric authentication solutions to enable customers to access mobile banking applications and services biokeys cloud based authentication platform could become the standard as enterprises in banking and healthcare seek to rollout biometrics the value proposition biokey is the cheapest way to play the rapid growth in biometrics as a software company its  gross margins give it tremendous operating leverage this year based on guidance biokey will generate over  million in revenue nearly double last year biokey is cheap at only x sales when compared to other biometric companies such as imageware systems otcqbiwsy which trades for x sales when you look at biokeys website you will scratch your head and wonder how this company has less then a  million dollar market cap given the abundance of marquis customers and partners i am going to argue that it is grossly undervalued one reason for the disconnect is a shareholder base that is so tired of waiting for biometrics to arrive while living through dilutive raise after dilutive raise over the last couple of years now that it has finally arrived they just dont care as a shareholder you get so angry with management you only look at the annoying stock price and not what they have actually accomplished in the last couple of years this is what makes opportunities the ability to put aside emotion and look at the facts so here are the facts revenue as just reported for nine months increased  in q the company lost a mere k with gross margins in the eighties you can see how they become extremely profitable from here if they continue the sales momentum experian partners with biokey to use biokeys technology in their id verification for their multiple product lines think about that for a minute  experian how many customers does experian have and if they roll out biometrics to only a fraction what would that mean for biokey recurring license revenue biokeys id director is pre integrated into allscripts ehr solutions and sold to healthcare customers such as hospitals clinics etc add to that epic ca caradigm and a host of other companies that sell to the hospitals using biokey as their biometrics solution healthcare industry requirements driven by state mandates dea and hipaa as it pertains to electronic health records and e prescriptions play right into biokeys sweet spot the industry has only just scraped the surface at keeping pace with these mandates and biokey is going to be a direct beneficiary biokey can just focus on the healthcare market where they are the leader and create value that is multiples of the current stock price idex one of the leading developers of biometric readers to the cell phone market is licensing biokeys algorithm ncr is using biokey in pos terminals at wendys nysewen and arbys which is owned by wendys ibm resellers are selling biokey to their customers interdigital nasdaqidcc one of the leading ip companies in the wireless industry has not only invested in biokey but has jointly developed with biokey an authentication product for smartphones biokey has brought on three new board members one of which is an executive at experian all three have been very active in guiding the company and have instituted the controls and discipline necessary to show more consistent growth an open letter by the board to shareholders in response to an activist proves that the board is engaged and that there is pressure to increase shareholder value it also suggests that biokey may be a likely takeover candidate with this type of market cap and the growth potential it wouldnt surprise me because biokey technology is software and not hardware based like competing technologies their gross margin is substantially higher often exceeding  thus the company can generate operating profits today with quarterly revenue above m according to management so what are the risks as with any micro cap stock theres a greater degree of failure im not worried as the three new board members have a high degree of knowledge and presence in the biometrics field furthermore the new board has instituted tight cost control measures as reported in the q  financial results conference call moreover the product sales cycle can be a long period of time so future revenue may appear lumpy at times for those investors who understand the industry this should not be a problem part i  financial information biokey international inc and subsidiary condensed consolidated balance sheets september   december   unaudited assets
