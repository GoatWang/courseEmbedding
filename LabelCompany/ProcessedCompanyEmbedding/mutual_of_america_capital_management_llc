price of the stock of a particular company can vary based on a variety of factors such as the companys financial performance changes in management and product trends and the potential for takeover and acquisition the prices of equity securities of smaller companies may fluctuate more than for more established companies the equity securities of smaller companies may not be traded as often as for larger companies therefore it may be difficult to trade securities at a desirable price investments in companies with small market capitalizations generally offer greater opportunities for appreciation but are associated with more risks than for established companies market risk the risk that prices of securities will go down because of the interplay of market forces may affect a single issuer industry or sector of the economy or may affect the market as a whole large cap risk larger more established companies may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges and also may not be able to attain the high growth rate of successful smaller companies mortgage risk the duration of mortgagerelated securities and interest rates tend to move together as interest rates rise the duration of mortgagerelated securities extends referred to as extension risk and as interest rates fall mortgagerelated securities are often prepaid at a faster rate referred to as prepayment risk

more credit risk than securities issued by us government agencies stock risk the value of your investment will go up or down depending on movements in the stock markets the investment results may be better or worse than the results for the stock markets taken as a whole or than the results of other funds that invest in the same types of securities it may be more difficult for the fund to sell a

investment will go up or down depending on movements in the bond markets investment management risk the funds investment results may differ from the results of a comparable bond market and from the results of other funds that invest in the same types of securities or particular debt securities interest rate risk fixed income securities have an inverse relationship to interest rates such that as interest rates rise bond values decrease and the fund faces a heightened level of interest rate risk under current conditions because interest rates are at historically low levels corporate debt risk during periods of economic uncertainty the value of corporate debt securities may decline relative to the value of us government debt securities debt obligations are subject to the risk that issuers may not be able to pay off the principal and interest when due credit risk debt obligations are generally subject to the risk that the issuer may be unable to make principal and interest payments when they are due call risk when interest rates decline an issuer may have an option to call the securities before maturity resulting in reduced income noninvestment grade debt risk noninvestment grade debt obligations known as junk bonds have a higher risk of default and tend to be less liquid than higherrated securities liquidity risk the prices of debt securities may be subject to significant volatility particularly as markets become less liquid due to limited dealer inventory of corporate bondsmoney market instrument risk money market instruments may decline in value based on the performance of the issuer or changes in prevailing interest rates the returns on money market instruments can be adversely affected when yields on eligible investments are low fund information for

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
