and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report and in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated financial statements including trends which might appear should not be taken as necessarily indicative of future operations the following discussion and other parts of this quarterly report on form q may also contain forwardlooking statements based on current judgments and current knowledge of management which are subject to certain risks trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forwardlooking statements accordingly readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements investors are cautioned that our forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainty including without limitation economic conditions in the united states and in the market where we own the property disruptions in the debt markets risks of a lessening of demand for the type of real estate owned by us changes in government regulations and regulatory uncertainty geopolitical events and expenditures that cannot be anticipated such as utility rate and usage increases unanticipated repairs uncertainty about government fiscal policy additional staffing insurance increases and real estate tax valuation reassessments although we believe the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot guarantee future results levels of activity performance or achievements we may not update any of the forwardlooking statements after the date this quarterly report on form q is filed to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations that occur after such date other than as required by law overview our company fsp  east wacker drive corp which we refer to as the company is a delaware corporation formed to purchase own and operate a twentyeight story multitenant office tower containing approximately  rentable square feet of office and retail space and a stall underground parking garage located in downtown chicago illinois which we refer to as the property franklin street properties corp which we refer to as franklin street is the sole holder of our one share of common stock  par value per share which we refer to as the common stock that is issued and outstanding between february  and december  fsp investments llc member finra and sipc a whollyowned subsidiary of franklin street completed the sale on a best efforts basis of  shares of our preferred stock  par value per share which we refer to as the preferred stock fsp investments llc sold the preferred stock in a private placement offering to accredited investors within the meaning of regulation d under the securities act of  since the completion of the placement of the preferred stock in december  franklin street has not been entitled to share in any earnings or dividend related to the common stock we operate in one business segment which is real estate operations and own a single property our real estate operations involve real estate rental operations leasing services and property management services the main factor that affects our real estate operations is the broad economic market conditions in the united states and more specifically the economic conditions in chicago illinois the relevant local market these market conditions affect the occupancy levels and the rent levels on both a national and local level we have no influence on national or local market conditions trends and uncertainties economic conditions the economy in the united states is continuing to experience a period of limited economic growth which directly affects the demand for office space our primary income producing asset the broad economic conditions including high levels of unemployment in the united states are affected by numerous factors including but not limited to inflation and employment levels energy prices slow growth andor recessionary concerns uncertainty about government fiscal policy changes in currency exchange rates geopolitical events the regulatory environment and the availability of debt and interest rate fluctuations current and future economic factors may negatively affect real estate values occupancy levels and property income at this time we cannot predict the extent or duration of any negative impact that current or future economic factors will have on our business real estate operations the property was approximately  leased as of june   to a diverse group of tenants with staggered lease expirations management believes that any tenant that leases  or more of the propertys rentable space is material as of june    tenants were leasing space at the property as of june   the propertys largest tenant was aecom technology corporation which we refer to as aecom as of june   aecom leased  square feet approximately  of the propertys rentable space through july   however as previously reported during the second quarter of  aecom signed a lease extension that allowed them to downsize at the property commencing on august   and that extended aecoms lease until  accordingly effective august   aecoms reduced space at the property covered two floors or approximately  square feet approximately  of the propertys rentable space aecom is a provider of professional technical and management support services acm  during the second quarter of  we signed two new leases with mcgraw hill global education a provider of digital educational solutions for  square feet and with the university of chicago for  square feet as previously reported during the first quarter of  we signed a lease with narrative science an information technology firm for  square feet also as previously reported effective july   groupon vacated the balance of its space approximately  rentable square feet at the property and its lease expired management believes that office buildings in the east loop submarket of chicago where the property is located continue to struggle with high vacancy rates and disappointing net absorption we believe that the office market in chicago and the east loop in particular has had difficulty stabilizing during the past five years with several of its office properties losing anchor tenants and experiencing declining occupancies we also believe that tenant improvement and leasing costs have risen during this time and consequently the amount of capital necessary to attract good tenants to sign longterm leases has climbed significantly although the property was approximately  leased at the conclusion of the second quarter of  management continues to be encouraged by the tour activity in the market and positive feedback from prospective tenants regarding the first impression overall appearance and condition of the property in addition we believe that we have the capital to fund the estimated tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions necessary to release the vacant space we have been saving rental cash flow over the last few years by keeping dividend levels lower than in prior periods and we suspended dividend distributions for the past two quarters we cannot guarantee the future payment of dividends or the amount of any such dividends as of june   our existing cash reserves totaled approximately  in addition in august  we secured a  loan from john hancock life insurance company to be used for just such releasing costs approximately  of the loan amount was remaining and available as of june   it is difficult for management to predict what will happen to occupancy and rents in the future because the need for space and the price tenants are willing to pay are tied to both the local economy and to the larger trends in the national economy such as job growth interest rates the availability of credit and corporate earnings which in turn are tied to even larger macroeconomic and political factors such as recessionary concerns volatility in energy pricing and the risk of terrorism in addition to the difficulty of predicting macroeconomic factors it is difficult to predict how our local market or tenants existing and potential will suffer or benefit from changes in the larger economy in addition because the property is in a single geographical market these macroeconomic trends may have a different effect on the property and on its tenants existing and potential some of which may operate on a national level although we cannot predict how long it will take to lease vacant space at the property or what the terms and conditions of any new leases will be we expect to sign new leases at thencurrent market rates which may be below the expiring rates during the three months ended june   we believe that vacancy rates increased slightly and that rental rates were stable for buildings in chicagos east loop office market these trends may continue worsen or improve in the future management believes that the position of the property within the east loop office market is strong and management is optimistic that the existing vacant space will ultimately be leased to new tenants in order to further improve the propertys position in chicagos office market management has implemented a number of lobby upgrades if we can stabilize the property at a high occupancy level with longterm quality rental income streams from creditworthy tenants we could create value for the holders of our preferred stock if successful in releasing the existing vacant space under favorable terms the opportunity for payment of dividends andor a sale of the property at an attractive price could be a real possibility of course any sale of the property would be subject to a number of conditions including approval by our board of directors and a majority of the holders of our preferred stock however we may not be able to lease all of the remaining vacant space the potential for any of our tenants to default on its lease or to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws exists if any of our tenants defaults on its lease we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment in addition at any time a tenant may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenants lease and thereby cause a reduction in cash available for distribution to our stockholders bankruptcy or a material adverse change in the financial condition of a material tenant would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations dividends future tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions management believes that the company will need to be able to quickly access cash in order to fund the potentially significant tenant improvements costs and leasing commissions that may be required to stabilize the occupancy and rent roll at the property we expect no or lower dividend distributions until occupancy levels at the property recover and we have a better idea of the propertys actual future capital and leasing needs in light of the amount of vacant space that needs to be leased at the property and the potential for significant tenant improvement allowance costs and leasing commissions on august   we entered into a mortgage note in favor of john hancock life insurance company usa which we refer to as the lender to evidence a loan which we refer to as the loan in the original principal amount of  that matures on september   the proceeds of the loan are being held by the lender for our benefit in a restricted reserve account or accounts to be drawn upon by us from time to time for tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions at the property upon satisfaction of certain conditions the loan bears interest at the fixed rate of  per annum we are obligated to make monthly payments of interest only for the initial  months of the loan thereafter we are obligated to make monthly payments of principal and interest for the remaining  months based on a year amortization schedule until the maturity date when all outstanding amounts become due the loan is secured in part by a mortgage assignment of leases and rents and security agreement which we refer to as the mortgage from us in favor of the lender the mortgage constitutes a lien against the property and has been recorded in the land records of cook county illinois subject to customary exceptions the loan is nonrecourse to the company as of june   we had made lender advance requests of  from the proceeds of the loan interest expense paid from the loan for the six months ended june   and  was  the documents evidencing and securing the loan include restrictions on property liens and requires compliance with various financial covenants financial covenants include the requirement that we provide annual reporting we were in compliance with the loan covenants as of june   and december   critical accounting policies we have certain critical accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates by our management and uncertainties of outcome that affect the application of these policies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and that require significant management estimates and judgments are discussed in item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates we believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations no change to our critical accounting policies has occurred since the filing of our annual report on form k for the year ended december   results of operations as of june   the property was approximately  leased to a diverse group of tenants with staggered lease expirations comparison of the three months ended
