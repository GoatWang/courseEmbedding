eads the european aerospace group that owns airbus was faced with the decision of how best to hedge a large and growing mismatch between its dollar revenues and its euro manufacturing costs specifically the company needed to decide if it would continue hedging primarily with forward contracts but in much higher volumes and at increasingly unfavorable rates or to break with past practice and begin using foreign exchange option contracts the decision would have consequences for eads profitability cash flow and its ability to fund strategic investment programs crucial to its ability to remain competitive with boeing students must address questions concerning the proper way to measure foreign exchange exposures the objectives of a rational risk management policy and program for a company like eads competing in a duopoly with boeing the differences between hedging with fx options versus fx futures counterparty risk and hedge accounting among other considerations preparing

range is listed also listed for each alloy are the forms it is available in alloy properties strength properties of some of the more common alloys shear strength tensile strength and density values for some of the common alloys additional alloy properties including information on conductivity brinell hardness elastic modulus surface tension  silver when a silver alloy is recommended the  silver is required when soldering to silver or silver plated componentsleads the small percent of silver in the solder prevents the silver on the leads from migrating into the solder resulting in a weak or brittle solder connection dross what is dross dross is an oxide that is formed of the tin and lead in the solder dross is generated by a combination of heat and agitation the hotter the solder pot is the faster the dross is generated also the more agitation the solder sees the more dross will be formed a nitrogen blanket will prevent oxygen from reaching the surface of the solder and the dross generation will be greatly diminished or eliminated there are also chemical dross reducing agents such as the kester  dross eliminator these chemical compounds react with the tin and lead oxides reducing them back to the base metal and releasing the oxygen to the air follow the instructions on the product data sheet when using chemical reducing agents sn vs sn when is the use of one of these two alloys more appropriate than the other the snpb has a plastic range and puts down a slightly thicker coating of solder sn is often preferred for lead tinning and other solder coating applications snpb is eutectic and as such has no plastic range generally it flows better than the sn and is the preferred alloy for wave soldering and surface mount applications gold colored solder assemblers are often concerned when they see a gold color on the surface of a solder pot the gold color is tin oxide when the surface of the molten solder is exposed to air it oxidizes and turns gold sometimes the tin oxide is a purpleblue color this is normal and can only be prevented by using an antioxidant powder or pellet the discoloration is a cosmetic defect and in no way degrades the reliability of the solder kester offers the  dross eliminator for this purpose solder analysis program sap shelf life shelf life policies the shelf life policy for kester’s solders and other nonchemical products can be found here flux flux residue removal removing noclean flux residues suggestions of how to remove the residues from noclean fluxes to remove the residues of noclean fluxes most solvents will work the best results are achieved by removing the residues in an aqueous spray cleaner the spray cleaner can be either a batch type or an inline type the addition of a saponifier kester   and hot water about °f will completely remove the flux residues removing organic acid oa flux residues it is required to remove the residues of oa fluxes you will get corrosion if you do not fully remove all the flux residues the flux residues from organic fluxes are hygroscopic they contain organic acids and they may contain halides over time the residues will absorb moisture and the halides will become mobile and corrosive this will lead to ‘catastrophic failure’ of the assembly in question we recommend cleaning with an aqueous cleaning system it can be either batch type or inline the water temperature should be between °f the important thing is to have lots of rinsing and flushing to completely remove all the flux residues white residue identification and categorization of white residues often found on cleaned circuit assemblies download article flux thinning soldering fluxes loose solvent and need additions of thinner flux is composed of solids dissolved in a solvent base over time the solvent evaporates as the solvent evaporates the solids concentrate and eventually crystallize out you will need to add thinner on a regular basis to prevent the flux from crystallizing a hydrometer is used to measure the specific gravity of the flux normally the specific gravity density is checked  or  times a day thinner is then added to return the flux to its correct density hydrometers can be purchased from any scientific supply house kester has flux density control data sheets also called nomographs for the rosin and higher solid content fluxes using the nomograph you can determine how much thinner needs to be added we sell test kits for the low residue fluxes the test kits indicate how much thinner to add to the flux pot what does noclean mean there is some apprehension at the description ‘noclean’ what does it mean the flux category called “noclean”  many fluxes fall into this category because the flux residues are not harmful to assemblies it does not mean there will be no residues all fluxes leave residues the solids are the active portion of the flux that does all the work some flux residues are conductive or corrosive and must be removed other fluxes like the noclean fluxes leave residues that do not need to be removed flux test kit the ps and ps test kits are used for flux control of low residuenoclean fluxes the ps and ps test kits are acid titration kits as solvent evaporates the acids in the flux become more and more concentrated the kit is used to determine the acid number of the flux the test is a simple drop test with an indicator for the endpoint similar to a swimming pool test you count the drops and then go to a chart from the chart you determine how much thinner to add to bring the acid number back down to spec traditionally flux control is maintained by measuring the density of the flux and adding thinner as the flux thickens this is a good method for fluxes with high solids contents a slight change in density corresponds to a small change in the flux the noclean fluxes have low solids percents typically  or   so a small change in the flux density could reflect the change in solids of  this would put the acid level unacceptably high the test kits are more accurate than using density measurements as a way to monitor the flux vocfree flux wave soldering profile a general profile setting up a wave solder machine to optimize reflow using an alcohol base flux download article vocfree flux considerations process changes that will have to be considered when changing from an alcohol based to a vocfree flux technology download article flux deposition how much noclean flux should be applied to a pcb and how does one determine the deposition rate download article rosin flux saponification saponifiers in an aqueous cleaner can be used to remove rosin flux residues what the biokleen  saponifier does is react with the outside layer of flux and soften it up lliterally turning it into a soap you need a spray cleaner so that this soap layer will be washed away which then allows the biokleen to react with the next layer rinse that layer off etc the problem with ultrasonic removal is that the outer layer is slightly dissolved and that is the end of the reaction in the meantime the solder is being exposed to an alkaline condition the exposed solder turns a dull gray as the surface shine is etched off by the caustic solution thinner calculation a calculation that can be used to determine how much thinner needs to be added to the flux to maintain a specified specific gravity the following formula can be used to determine how much kester   thinner to add to the kester   flux to bring it back to the recommended specific gravity density for your information this formula can be used for any kester flux that utilizes the   thinner v   x – y   y –  where v  ounces of   thinner to be added per gallon of flux x  present flux density y  desired flux density for example the flux is at  and it should be at  v      or v   or v   ounces of thinner per gallon of flux  –   storage of flammable materials most rosin fluxes are flammable materials this is a general guide to storage of flammable materials kester does not have a required temperature and humidity for storage of flammable liquid chemicals from a safety standpoint we recommend storage at room temperature and humidity for flammable materials we recommend storage in an approved flammable materials storage cabinet storage above normal room temperature can be risky as the material alcohol will build up pressure in the container there is a risk the material will spew out of the container when opened flux thinning soldering fluxes lose solvent and need additions of thinner flux is composed of solids dissolved in a solvent base over time the solvent evaporates as the solvent evaporates the solids concentrate and eventually crystallize out you will need to add thinner on a regular basis to prevent the flux from crystallizing a hydrometer is used to measure the specific gravity of the flux normally the specific gravity density is checked  or  times a day thinner is then added to return the flux to its correct density hydrometers can be purchased from any scientific supply house kester has flux density control data sheets also called nomographs for the rosin and higher solid content fluxes using the nomograph you can determine how much thinner needs to be added we sell test kits for the low residue fluxes the test kits indicate how much thinner to add to the flux pot rosin flux removal do rosin flux residues need to be removed rosin flux residues are nonconductive and noncorrosive under normal circumstances they do not have to be removed from a printed circuit assembly rosin residue removal would be for cosmetic considerations in an environment where the working temperature of the assembly will exceed °f the rosin residues will melt and become conductive in these situations flux removal is required

fully remove all the flux residues the flux residues from organic fluxes are hygroscopic they contain organic acids and they may contain halides over time the residues will absorb moisture and the halides will become mobile and corrosive this will lead to ‘catastrophic failure’ of the assembly in question we recommend cleaning with an aqueous cleaning system it can be either batch type or

thicker than  microinches the solder most likely may not dissolve all the gold and bond to it the solder will be dull looking and if the gold content in the solder exceeds about  the solder joint will be brittle if the gold is thin less than  microinches it easily dissolves into the solder making the solder joint look grainy if the metal that was under the gold is not oxidized the goldcontaminated solder will bond to it however as gold plates usually in a columnar structure the gold should be at least  microinches thick to protect the base metal in most cases nickel from oxidation download article soldering to stainless steel stainless steel is a difficult metal to solder to download article  silver when is a silver alloy is recommended the  silver is required when soldering to silver or silver plated componentsleads the small percent of silver in the solder prevents the silver on the leads from migrating into the solder resulting in a weak or brittle solder connection soldering to aluminum aluminum is an extremely difficult metal to solder to kester does not have any products for soldering to aluminum soldering thermocouple wires thermocouple materials are not solderable it is possible to surround the thermocouple wire encapsulate it with solder but you cannot make a metallurgical bond to it it is important to note that even if you could solder the two wires back together the thermocouple still will not work a thermocouple works by measuring the change in resistance of the two dissimilar metals joined in the welded bead if one were to join the metals with a solder interconnect the thermocouple would give meaningless numbers the way to fix a broken thermocouple is to reweld the thermocouple bead if you wish to attach a thermocouple to a printed circuit board for reflow profiling you can use a high temperature alloy to encapsulate it or use a cyanoacrylate adhesive to stick it to the board questions about solderability download article creating solder joint

an elementary introduction to options and option pricing for beginning finance students analysis of the case requires students to compare the prices of put and call options with various exercise

students to do a series of static comparisons that reveal the impact of a change in one determinant of an options price while holding other factors constant the business setting involves a mutual fund board considering the initiation of an option trading strategy to enhance the riskadjusted performance of the fund and through covered call writing to increase earned income that can be used to support cash dividend distributions although the administrative situation is fictional the data contained in the case are real the case is best positioned at the beginning of a course module on
