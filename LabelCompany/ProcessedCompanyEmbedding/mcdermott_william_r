over to you my friend luka mucic  chief operating  financial officer thank you very much bill if i was asked to summarize this quarter in one sentence then it would simply be we did what we said we would do we delivered an exceptionally strong quarter im proud how sap is navigating ahead with extraordinary success across all business dimensions as bill has alluded to our stability and diversification makes sap rock solid especially in a world where we see a lot of volatility in certain economies in fact the second quarter marked the th consecutive quarter with a growth rate of  plus in cloud on a reported basis yet another strong result this quarter leads us to  growth in the cloud for the first six months of the year our license revenue was equally strong in the second quarter which puts us now at  growth in software licenses for the first half of  in parallel the second quarter surge in our cloud and software business resulted in an  growth in our cloud and software revenue at the halfway point of the year with all of this momentum in the first half of the year all our key revenue metrics are at the highend of the fullyear guidance but we are not just having success on the top line the results on the bottom line this quarter provide an additional proof point that we are committed to our transformation with better effectiveness and efficiency we saw continued operating profit expansion with  growth now let me discuss our financial results in some more detail first to the top line as our cloud business continues to grow at a fast pace it is becoming a significant piece of our growth story our results this quarter speak for themselves the  cloud revenue growth this quarter is sticking well ahead of the cagr for our  ambitions the strength of our committed future revenue is also reflected in our new cloud bookings which increased sequentially and were up  yearoveryear combined with our strong cloud backlog and our strong bookings performance in  we are well on track to deliver on our midterm growth ambitions in the cloud software revenue showed an impressive growth of  and we closed all of the main deals that slipped in the first quarter at  growth our support revenue is likewise completely in line with our expectations demonstrating this revenue lines stickiness and defensive qualities the very very high renewal rates that we are enjoying are signaling a healthy growth rate and high predictability also going forward as a result our more predictable revenue was  of our total revenue for the first six months thats up  percentage points yearoveryear this demonstrates that our business has become more stable which is a clear differentiator especially at times when insecurity and volatility in certain markets are becoming a habit now to the second quarter regional results we had a very strong performance in the emea region as we successfully navigated through the postuk referendum uncertainty our cloud and software revenue increased by  and our cloud subscriptions and support revenue grew  in emea sap had strong doubledigit software revenue growth in france the netherlands switzerland across southern europe and again a very solid performance in germany russia and germany both had an exceptional quarter in cloud revenue growth in the americas region we grew cloud and software revenue as well by  and cloud subscriptions and support revenue by  north america delivered a very solid performance after coming off a slow start to the year in latin america the political and macro instability continued however we saw strong doubledigit software revenue growth in both brazil as well as mexico in the apj region cloud and software revenue was up  and cloud subscriptions and support revenue grew by  we had strong results in china and india with doubledigit software revenue whereas in japan we even had almost tripledigit growth all these three countries also had doubledigit cloud revenue growth for the quarter now to the bottom line in the second quarter as ive said before we saw continued operating profit expansion the  surge in operating profit outpaced the total revenue growth of  this second quarter performance reflects the success of our business transformation to improve efficiency and effectiveness in each and every of our businesses we continued to grow absolute operating profit even as we continued to hire in fast growth areas in fact our head count increased by approximately  fulltime equivalents this year on an ifrs basis our operating profit was up  the primary reason for this increase obviously was that the restructuring costs were significantly lower compared to the prior year as we had predicted earlier this year going into more detail now i would like to talk about the gross margin development for the quarter on a reported basis for the first half of the year our cloud margin improved to  up  basis points yearoveryear for the second quarter the cloud gross margin was  just a decrease of  basis points yearoveryear why we are investing heavily in personnel for our cloud operations and are also incurring costs to convert our acquired cloud applications onto sap hana which will provide massive benefits for customers and sap going forward if you look at our cloud margin in more detail you can see that our business network cloud subscriptions margin increased to  additionally the applications technology  services or ats cloud subscriptions margin was stable at  this is actually impressive given the accelerated growth of our private cloud business which causes a mix shift effect within the ats segment since the private cloud margin is still negative however based on the great progress that we have made in our private cloud profitability we expect our private cloud business to break even in half year two there is an additional mix shift effect on the overall cloud margin since the ats segment now has a higher share of our total cloud business which also impacted the cloud margin overall we continue to expect the cloud gross margin to be stable for the full year the software and support gross margin the gross margin of our core business was  which is up  basis points from the prior year this positive result was primarily due to the strong license performance our combined cloud and software gross margin was  up  basis points yearoveryear the strong performance in our core business overcompensated the usual mix shift effect that you would expect to see from the cloud business on our cloud and software gross margin our services gross margin was down by  percentage points yearoveryear to  i want to point out that we had an expense reclassification that lifted the level of the services margin by roughly  percentage points however this had no impact on the yearoveryear comparison as historical quarterly growth services margin growth rates were likewise changed accordingly regarding the sequential development this quarter we saw an increase in the services margin by  percentage points our resulting overall gross margin was  up  basis points yearoveryear the ifrs tax rate in the second quarter was  up from  in the prior year period the nonifrs tax rate in the second quarter was  up from  in the prior year period compared to our previous outlook we now expect the fullyear  ifrs tax rate of  to  and the nonifrs effective tax rate of  to  this increase in comparison to the previous outlook mainly results from two things the changes in foreign currency exchange rates in venezuela negative impacted our second quarter effective tax rates as well as our outlook for the full year secondly we are currently working on the centralization of our ip rights to simplify and standardize our enterprise processes while large parts of our acquired ip could already be migrated to germany we could not achieve the originallyplanned consolidation of hybris intellectual property rights at this point of time ifrs earnings per share grew by  to € per share and nonifrs earnings per share grew by  to € per share operating cash flow for the first six months was € billion up by  yearoveryear at the end of the second quarter we improved our net liquidity by € billion compared to the end of  in the same period we paid back debt of almost € million and paid out a dividend of € billion as a result at the end of the second quarter we had a remaining net debt of only € billion as bill mentioned earlier our quarterly results were not impacted by the uk referendum i would also like to note that our financial liquidity was not impacted either at sap we follow a centralized cash management approach whereby the liquidity of many entities is centralized by our cash pooling structures sap uk is one of those entities we also increased the hedge ratio of our balance sheet exposure to almost  for the british pound ahead of the vote now moving on to our outlook bill has said it as a result of our strong pipeline we are obviously and firmly reiterating our outlook for the full year for the rest of the year we have updated our expectations for the currency impact of reporting – reported growth rates in  for details on the reiterated outlook and the currency impacts please refer to our quarterly statement and half year report published earlier today so in closing we today released very strong second quarter results across all key revenue and profit metrics we again proved that our decision to transform our business was the right one this has enabled us to steadily increase profit while continuing to invest in growth our fundamental growth drivers are and remain rock solid sap hana has become the industry standard in memory data platform and there is absolutely no doubt our more than  shana customers helped propel us to this success the strong demand for shana demonstrates our leading position as an innovator providing businesses a comprehensive technology platform to succeed in the new digital economy we have never been more focused on where our customers strive to be with this impressive second quarter our halfyear financial results together with robust pipeline across all regions put us in a very strong position entering the second half of  thank you very much and we will now be happy to take your questions stefan gruber  headinvestor relations thank you operator you can now start the qa session questionandanswer session operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time we will begin the questionandanswer session and your first question is from john king of bank of america please go ahead john p king  bank of america merrill lynch great thanks very much for taking the questions and congratulations on the strong second quarter maybe just to start off bill in the context of the product cycle i think you said that was ahead of initial expectations and obviously you reiterated the guidance for  how should we start to think about how this could impact  if its not too early to think about that i guess as we get into more of the kind of volume adoption of s i think previously youve talked about structural decline of the license business a modest decline is it possible that we might think about outperforming that kind of mediumterm guidance in  if you start to see the broader adoption of s and the second question was for luca probably on the tax rate obviously quite a big change for the tax rate guidance for this year related to venezuela and hybris whats the initial thinking again as to whether thats a oneoff or whether that should normalize looking out i guess neither of those businesses are huge in the context of overall sap so just trying to understand how much of an impact that can have on a kind of medium and longterm basis thanks william r mcdermott  chief executive officer well why dont i start off john by thanking you appreciate the kind remarks and just wanted you to know it means a lot to me that all of you on the call today because we really feel excited about our story on shana this is a multiyear upgrade cycle opportunity and if you think about us slightly less than  into that journey you can see a lot of runway thats still left in the business model just on the upgrade cycle but then when you add on the fact that  of these shana deals are coming in on a new business level you really kind of get excited that maybe there is a major movement going on here which is why we felt very comfortable firmly confidently reiterating the guidance for the full year but also giving you some reason to have optimism on the sap company going forward and one of the examples i gave was a customer thats using shana to pivot with all of our line of business cloud solutions and our business network because the magic of shana is really connecting the demand chain with any channel and any customer on any device with the supply chain and when you can do that in real time in memory with all the data at your fingertips we can really make decisions as executives that fundamentally rethink and reimagine business on the fly so thats huge the second piece that i think of as under reported is the fact that you can run this all in the cloud so as you think about what percentage it will grow whether we recognize it ratably or we recognize it as a perpetual license remains to be seen but theres no question that it is the de facto standard for innovation in the business or for our industry thats kind of where thats at and then ill let luka tell you about the venezuela piece which we spent some time on and of course its a onetime luka luka mucic  chief operating  financial officer yeah absolutely so first of all venezuela for us had two accumulating negative effects one in the foreign currency result so it is actually surprising how much negative impact such a small country like venezuela can generate but believe it or not due to the again heavy heavy deterioration of the bolivar we have accumulated for this first half year overall an almost € million negative hit from the bolivar out of which almost € million were occurring in q as a consequence of this we accumulate tax losses in venezuela which generally speaking under normal circumstances would allow you to incur a corresponding deferred tax asset for later realization however the situation in venezuela has become so sobering that we now have to consider it as improbable that such a deferred tax asset could be utilized in a foreseeable timeframe and hence were not allowed to build it so weve been hit twice by this and this is obviously onetime effect now on the hybris effect thats actually a slightly different story because the ip consolidation of hybris in germany would have resulted in a onetime positive effect that we had actually anticipated and expected as part of our etr guidance for  which now has not been able to be finished in time were obviously continuing our efforts and hope to be back next year and realize this effort however it will not heighten for this year anymore so this would have been a positive effect that simply did not occur okay thank you very much john p king  bank of america merrill lynch thats very clear thank you stefan gruber  headinvestor relations thank you lets move to the next question please operator the next question is from the line of kirk materne of evercore isi please go ahead kirk materne  evercore group llc yes thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on the quarter bill my question is around shana adoption clearly you guys have since seen a great move out of the gate on that i guess just two questions on that one in terms of the new customers coming to you for the first time is there any commonality in terms of the size of the customer are you getting into the midmarket more effectively with s or any particular region that you feel like youre picking up share that perhaps you didnt historically and then i guess the second part of the question is what needs to happen to sort of take the trajectory of adds from the sort of  per quarter level up to  to  as we think forward to calendar  and calendar  thanks william r mcdermott  chief executive officer well kirk thank you very much for the question the first thing i wanted to mention is as you saw from sapphire we recognize that the capabilities of this product and what it can do to transform businesses actually in fact sometimes outstrips the customers imagination and in some cases early on it outstripped the knowledge level of our people calling on the customer which is why we redoubled our efforts at sapphire for the road mapping exercise and really mapping the solution to the customer delivery process and the value that they would extract from such an unbelievable invention so with that as a backdrop we spent the board offsite this weekend talking about just that how are we going to really explode this all over the world and without stealing the thunder of my dear colleagues i think its really important that we hear from rob and we also hear from bernd as it relates to s because you got the field channel and then of course you have the development lead and i think they have a very unique perspective on just how successful this product is and how much it still has to go rob enslin  presidentglobal customer operations and executive board member yeah thank you bill this is robert here great question we see actually an acceleration of s in terms of the amount of implementations theres over  implementations now taking place around the world odd are live and plusminus a couple of a hundred are ongoing more importantly i think when bill talks about  new customers and weve seen a significant uptick in the upper segment of the midmarket in places like latin america and asia where customers see this as the future opportunity in the erp space actually they see this as kind of the goto platform if you want to be a digital company and you want to be competitive so that is clearly moving the needle for us and then i would say lastly the value assurance program connecting the roadmap for the cloud product bringing that to the fore has clearly shown that we have a full cloud onpremise business that customers really want to see with that ill hand over to mr leukert bernd leukert  member of the executive board headproducts  innovation yeah thanks rob thanks bill just to add a few points from the product perspective i think you all know that we launched shana just to remind you of that february  so this is not a product which is four years out in the market and is a significant growth driver and contributing to the great q we have massively invested during the course of  and you still remember that last year we had the conversation when is the product complete and we had in q so the  release a complete coverage of the hana adoption and exploitation across the entire modules in s and then we look now at the q numbers we strongly see that this massively adds to value adds to benefit and this broad adoption of hana across the entire suite is now paying off and from a product perspective we are fully confident that its not just a renewal of existing processes we have now a strong driver in innovations in new capabilities which we have not been able to provide to our customers before stefan gruber  headinvestor relations okay thank you very much lets move to the next question please operator and the next question is from the line of gerardus vos of barclays please go ahead gerardus vos  barclays capital securities ltd hi thanks for taking my question and congratulations from me as well just a couple if i may first of all i just want to come back on the kind of golives the  i believe it was around € million in the kind of first quarter when should we kind of expect a ramp in this kind of figure and perhaps related to this as well the services clearly continue to be on the pressure during the quarter i can imagine that has something to do with the kind of ramp of golives so maybe you link that in as well and then secondly great results on the operating profit which is now running quite ahead of the fullyear guidance and im cognizant of the fact that in the second half you have the cost benefit dropping out how should we kind of model this forward or is that kind of plus  now a more feasible kind of target for the full year thank you luka mucic  chief operating  financial officer yeah maybe i can start with the services question and the question on operating profit modeling for the second half year and then the colleagues can handle the go lives question so first of all when you take a look at our services result yes it looks as if services continues to be under pressure if you take it from an outside perspective however in it you can see that a in a lot of the efficiency metrics in the services business we actually have improved in this quarter so we see a pretty much improved revenue conversion ratio we see a higher overall productive utilization and we had a very strong bookings performance as well so this is making me actually quite confident that we will see a turnaround in this business what the results dont show at the face value is that we have suffered in q from two oneoff effects from the past a project settlement as well as increased loss accruals in some investment projects that we have done in apj if you would exclude those effects actually our services business would have been growing on the top line already in midsingledigits and also the profit would have had a much better performance so thats important to keep note of and we expect that going forward the business will continue to improve on a steady pace as those fundamental current metrics around revenue conversion as well as productive utilization are improving then secondly on your question around operating profit i mean its very clear that in the first halfyear we have benefited from increased leverage through the successful transformation program that we have conducted in  in the first half the resulting run rate benefit was really unmatched by a corresponding benefit in  thats why youve seen the very strong progression in operating profit in the second halfyear as we had already a pretty sizable chunk of the transformation program completed at the midpoint of  we have already parts of the run rate benefit in the second half figures for  so that means that you should not necessarily expect that operating profit growth in double digits would continue in halfyear two having said that we believe that we have really now optimized the structure of the company in a way that we can continue to invest into the high growth areas and into innovation as bill alluded to into machine learning internet of things connected health and so on while at the same time still continuing to expand operating profit thats what we have committed to and hence the confident reiteration of our fullyear guidance in terms of operating profit progression now over to the colleagues  stefan gruber  headinvestor relations thank you  i think rob you might want to handle that rob enslin  presidentglobal customer operations and executive board member yeah ill take it so i think this is what we can expect towards the end of the year midtohightripledigit customer go live we are really focused on getting our partners trained more than  really trained well have close to  by the end of the year our internal consultants have now welltrained and we see that go lives are actually taking between six months to nine months so a lot faster than anything else in the marketplace also believe that when we look at the stability of s and how customers have actually seen the rock solid quality of this product you will actually continue to see a mass extrapolation of go lives into the years so mid to high triple digits gerardus vos  barclays capital securities ltd okay thanks very much william r mcdermott  chief executive officer thank you thanks  stefan gruber  headinvestor relations thank you lets take the next question please operator the next question is from the line of charles brennan of credit suisse please go ahead charles a brennan  credit suisse securities europe ltd great so congratulations and thanks very much for taking my questions just a couple of questions for me actually firstly can we go back to the net new customers  coming from new customers is quite a significant number you implied that that was primarily the upper mid market does that mean that  corresponds to a much smaller percentage of revenue during the period and then the second question just talking about the comps for the second half of the year luka i think you wanted to be exiting the first half in positive license territory to give you some breathing space against the fourth quarter comp do you think youve done enough here to derisk the outlook for the second half of the year or are you still looking at the fourth quarter with a bit of a gasp for breath thanks stefan gruber  headinvestor relations maybe on the net new customers rob you can comment this and of course the second question is for luka then rob enslin  presidentglobal customer operations and executive board member yeah i wouldnt take the combination of customer counts and revenue to be equated just midmarket i think what you see is the large sap customers on – are looking at transforming the digital environment rapidly fast we saw that with nestlé weve seen that with companies like accenture but what you see is companies that are moving to a nextgeneration erp system from older systems are actually looking at s as the future and thats what we see in the mid markets so theres new companies coming to sap quite a lot luka mucic  chief operating  financial officer yeah and maybe to the second question so i have one principle in business and thats to play fearless i dont have fear about the second half year and in terms of the – in terms of where we are actually i want to expand this a little bit beyond licenses youre absolutely right i wanted us at the halfyear point to show positive growth in licenses in order to make sure that we derisk the full year performance i am absolutely at the point where i wanted us to be with  growth in licenses we are kind of at the implied highend of the license guidance if you take it in as a component of cloud and software revenues if you talk about cloud and software revenues at the halfyear point we are plus  and we guided for  to  so we are absolutely at the high end there and in terms cloud we guided at the top end for  growth and we are right at  growth at the halfyear mark so i think thats a perfect basis for us to execute against in the second half year of course its not set that having first two quarters in a good shape means that the second good – two quarters will be in the same shape we need to earn our right and to win at the customer front that means we need to stay in traffic  we need to embrace the values that bill and rob have also alluded to run the value assurance program plays make sure our customers understand the value that we can bring to the table execute with precision so that we can earn the repeat trust and then im absolutely confident that we will arrive at the guidance that we have set out at the beginning of the year so im definitely not shivering actually its much too hot in germany these days that i could even start thinking about shivering william r mcdermott  chief executive officer and charles one of the things that keeps us all very very focused is the fact that we run the company on hana and when you need information around the pipeline in any geography in any industry in any channel we have the facts so today is the perfect combination of a well executed first half but also a pipeline that is very healthy across the board for sap its on that basis of a focused management team and inspired workforce and very clear pipeline that we say to you we go in and strongly reiterate guidance for the second half so everything is in place and were ready to go stefan gruber  headinvestor relations okay thank you lets move to the next question please operator next question is from the line of adam wood of morgan stanley please go ahead adam d wood  morgan stanley  co international plc hi thanks so much for taking the question and also congratulations from me on the excellent quarter maybe just first of all thinking about the spending and investments you obviously had good operating leverage in the first half of the year and youve been highlighting how those investments can continue luka theres obviously some macro uncertainty out there how do you think about pacing the investments to the second half especially given the year as always will be backend loaded and then maybe a bigger picture question theres a lot of focus today on frontend customer engagement and customer digitalization when youre dealing with companies to what extent are they starting to think about also working on their back ends thinking about digital manufacturing iot is that starting to be a driver of hana adoption and how significant do you think that could be as a driver for adoption of the company thank you luka mucic  chief operating  financial officer yeah so ill take the first question on the investment levels as you know adam also from the past of course we would have flexibility in our investment plans if we had signs that we were looking at a slowdown of our business as bill had said we have absolutely no signs to that end but of course we will continue to monitor the situation we are absolutely committed to our guidance not only on the top line but also on the bottom line so rest assured that we will manage our responsibly in order to hit it as well there are some investments that i very strongly and adamantly believe in and on which we will not compromise those are those investments that will make us nimbler and more efficient going forward especially in our cloud business so we will absolutely march forward on replacing thirdparty databases as the basis of our cloud solutions so we have made great progress and we will continue to work on that path we will continue to work on converging our cloud infrastructures and consolidating our data centers into less but more effective central locations because this will help us in cloud margin progression going forward on the remaining part of the investments we have flexibility and can react in the short term but dont see this as necessary at this point because were very confident in our top line prospects william r mcdermott  chief executive officer and if you think about the internet of things and the front end and the back end to fully leverage the internet of things the front end has to coalesce with the back end so for example during the nba championship playoffs we featured kevin plank and under armour in a commercial and what we demonstrate is the athlete and the concept of connected fitness to the device connecting that athlete to communities that they participate in they care a lot about their nutrition they care a lot about the number of steps theyre taking a day they care a lot about their biorhythms but then a company like under armour has to care a lot about the channels that they shop in so when theyre coming in direct to consumer they also have to have a social media understanding as well as a retail or a wholesale understanding of the customer so if youre really going to do internet of things i dont know how you do it without knowing the consumer in any channel on any device and then being able to fulfill wherever they are in the world so you start to see the application not only the transaction and the things and the consumer but you also think about issues like geospatial and the various ways to market and precise market the consumers no matter where theyre at this is the whole idea of shana and crm now being a lot more than contacts management and forecasting youre really into an omnichannel ecommerce endtoend demand and supply chain world and the iot is right in the center of that and thats what we do adam d wood  morgan stanley  co international plc thats right helpful thank you stefan gruber  headinvestor relations thank you william r mcdermott  chief executive officer thank you stefan gruber  headinvestor relations the next question please operator the next question is from knut woller of baader bank please go ahead knut woller  baader bank ag broker yeah hello thank you for taking my questions actually two the first one to bill i think you mentioned that more than  of the erp base has now moved to s can you give us an idea in terms of the overall investment and revenue opportunity you see from this  where we are currently is it something like  of the revenue opportunity from this part of the installed base that has moved is it higher or lower and how long do you think it will take to harvest that opportunity then lastly if i look at total revenues by region it looks like the rest of apj is falling a bit off compared to all the other regions was here the effect you mentioned from the legacy services business having a negative impact or were there any other reasons explaining that slightly lower performance compared to the average growth rate in apj in q thank you william r mcdermott  chief executive officer on the second part with regard to apj im not sure specifically what data point youre poking at but we should let you illuminate that so we give you a specific answer but as it relates to the shana penetration it is early stages of whats possible with shana even in the install base so its certainly not  we still are in a very early stage progression of the massive upgrade cycle and net new selling cycle thats going to go on with shana now were starting to talk about industries and market segments and things like that to even expand it further so please know that that is very early stage its got a lot of run rate and a lot of momentum ill let rob comment on apj specifically but i could tell you that in apj – if you give us the specific of the question well answer it – but apj is in very good shape when you look at india you look at china the only challenge is weve seen a little bit is australia but thats consistent with what youve heard from every other company but count on apj to continue to be a force multiplier of growth for sap and one of the reasons i really like apj right now is because of our global footprint and the strong presence that we have in the install base and the size and bandwidth and scale of our ecosystem it makes it very difficult for smaller companies to go in there and compete with us because to compete with us youd have to throw a lot of resources at it and they usually lose so i think what youll see them do is stay in markets where they have a chance to win rob rob enslin  presidentglobal customer operations and executive board member yeah i would just say that australia and new zealand is a tale of two right now with the government kind of almost shutting down as the elections took place public sector spending slowed down in the second half it will pick up in the back half as the governments stabilize but we have seen tremendous tremendous performance in the cloud business in australia and new zealand it is growing tremendously well customers absolutely adopting successfactors ariba and actually our hana enterprise cloud movement so the positive movements when you look at australia and new zealand other than that as bill alluded we feel really good about india southeast asia japan is like coming back like a storm drain our cloud business in china is good so its a really good region and its actually doing consistently well every quarter knut woller  baader bank ag broker great thank you stefan gruber  headinvestor relations okay thank you we have time for two more questions please operator next question is from the line of walter pritchard of citi please go ahead walter h pritchard  citigroup global markets inc broker hi thanks just one quick one on the new customer accounts im curious how focused you are simply on that metric i know theres lots of other things from a shana perspective that matter with the  customers how focused are you on driving that and measuring that on a quarterly basis william r mcdermott  chief executive officer yeah thats a very good question one of the things i wanted to mention and i want to get this gentlemen involved in the conversation a little bit here were very focused on it first of all and were going to get increasingly focused on it because the problem is with the fortune  or the fortune  is it only  or  of them i mean theres a lot of businesses out there so when you look at companies like concur and ariba and fieldglass one of the unique attributes of the business network move that we made was not just enabling companies to collaborate and conduct commerce and business with each other but we also acquired a wonderful leader and now an executive board member in steve singh and we moved over small mediumsized enterprise responsibility to steve with our cloud portfolio of products because were massively concerned with a the crosssell capability coming from the shana world and b all kinds of net new customers that we can work through a channel that sap was not that well represented in so i would like number one to give steve a chance to say a few words today on how he sees things going with sap and how confident he is how we can expand in the sap franchise with regard to our cloud products as well as our sme products theres a lot of net new names there steve singh  executive board member at sap president business networks and applications thank you yeah thanks bill so i think the way that i would ask you to think about this is that we think that the – we could deliver all of our cloud products to smb customers on a global basis as bill mentioned concur has a very large focus in the smb segment in fact about  of concurs business in any given quarter are net new customers to sap and we did sign a few thousand customers a quarter in that space one of the other things i think we have a tremendous opportunity to do is actually deliver a full suite of integrated services of cloud services that allow our customers to run their entire business everything from the erp suite to the line of business applications and delivering that to not just the concur channel but even as we continue to build out our channels for our midmarket erp business and ariba fieldglass and successfactors businesses so this is – we think this is a huge growth opportunity in the years ahead for sap walter h pritchard  citigroup global markets inc broker and then luka just on ma you talked about being proud that you paid down debt and your liquidity position im wondering the last acquisition i think bill described as completely new how are you thinking about ma thats seems like the only thing here that could disrupt margins if you were to do another larger transaction other than that it seems like youre on your way to your  goals for  margins william r mcdermott  chief executive officer yeah maybe i could start on that answer and then id be most happy to have luka build on it and the reason i feel most happy to do that is because youre seeing a ceo and a cfo totally aligned and an executive board thats totally aligned so basically we made the big moves when we had the opportunity to get pristine assets off the market and make them part of the sap company there are not a lot of opportunities like the ones weve done in the marketplace today at any price but certainly in a price thats semireasonable so our objective is to take all this organic innovation which is what were talking about today lets celebrate that this is organic growth isnt that nice and when we do an acquisition you can think of it more in the tuckin category and highly complementary to what weve given you in the mid and a little bit longerterm guidance to  so were aligned we love our credit rating we love paying down the debt and we love putting our shareholders in a position to watch growth happen the right way luka mucic  chief operating  financial officer yeah im actually running out of anything else that i could add to this perfectly right and all the acquisitions that we did since we closed concur were paid out of our normal cash flow so thats kind of the type of tuckins that we can easily digest and on anything that would be slightly bigger it wouldnt really need to address a wide space in our solution portfolio and as our wide spaces have become smaller over time as we have worked both organically as well as through integrating the acquisitions that we did already so will naturally be a size of any acquisitions that we might consider bernd leukert  member of the executive board headproducts  innovation thank you we are almost at the end already at the end of the hour but we have time for one final question please operator and the question is from the line of patrick walravens from jmp please go ahead pat d walravens  jmp securities llc great thank you bill id love to hear your thoughts on why salesforce was willing to spend  billion to buy linkedin and if the opportunity to apply artificial intelligence to application softwares is really that big william r mcdermott  chief executive officer well im not sure what they were actually willing to pay pat you know better than me but im pretty sure that microsoft was the one that ended up with them meaning linkedin and when i look at it from – on microsoft perspective its a natural extension of office  in a sense you can also think of it a little bit as a crm application because now ive got a very large channel of consumers that i know a lot about that maybe i can upsell and crosssell very special things to but also as you look at their importance in the ecosystem i think satya has done a very good job of making them an open company in the ecosystem with azure and its very nice i think to be able to say to their key partners hey as an extension of some of the things that youre doing in human capital management wouldnt it be nice if in recruiting and other techniques that you have on the hr side linkedin could potentially be a part of that so i think theres an ecosystem play i think theres a core business play and certainly i think theres a business network effect that you can monetize with an asset like linkedin and certainly a company with microsofts reach and capabilities and success theyre in a position to do something like that and i wish them the absolute best with that asset pat d walravens  jmp securities llc great thank you william r mcdermott  chief executive officer thank you pat stefan gruber  headinvestor relations thank you very much and this concludes our sap second quarter earnings call thanks

seasonallysmallest quarter the results show that even as the world economy is changing fast sap represents the innovation strength and stability of a market leaderlast week i visited with numerous sap customers heres what they told me theyre looking for sap leadership in three main areas first shana to be the st century suite of bestinclass business applications second they want sap line of business cloud and business network applications to remain bestofbreed third they believe strongly in the idea of oltp and olap in one database a database yes that can do both transactions and analytics hana will be their database platform of choice it is time for new architecture on each count its clearly on me that saps fundamental growth drivers are rock solid let me share some q highlightswe saw a continued fast growth in cloud at  tracking to the high end of guidance nonifrs cloud and software revenue was up  at constant currencies within our guidance range we again saw our record share of more predictable revenue perfectly consistent with our wellknown strategy ifrs earnings per share were up  nonifrs eps was up  please note i think its interesting that this performance significantly exceeds our peer group benchmarknow let me add some commentary on our growth drivers for the company sap added more than  shana customers in the quarter of which approximately  of those are net new this means that sap is successfully migrating customers from our own r system and from competitive erp systems as well we continue to see widespread interest in shana migration as customers seek to reduce complexity reduce hardware cost improve their user experience and increase growth opportunities through business model innovationwhen i speak to ceos and cfos around the world they all want a digital boardroom capability so that they can engage with live data in powerful new ways they want to expand into new industries they want the agility to adapt to consumer behavior and changes in the macro environment on the fly shana powers all of these business outcomes and morethe shana innovation cycle is also catalyzing broad customer adoption of our entire innovation portfolio
