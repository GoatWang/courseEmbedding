resulting in a debate over the color of an item of clothing from buzzfeeds tumblr editor cates holderness garnered more than  million views in one day setting a record for most concurrent visitors to a buzzfeed post holderness had showed the picture to other members of the sites social media team who immediately began arguing about the dress colors among themselves after creating a simple poll for users of the site she left work and took the subway back to her brooklyn home when she got off the train and checked her telephone it was overwhelmed by the messages on various sites i couldnt open twitter because it kept crashing i thought somebody had died maybe i didnt know what was going on later in the evening the page set a new record at buzzfeed for concurrent visitors which would reach  at its peak criticism and controversiesedit benny johnson was fired from buzzfeed in july  for plagiarism buzzfeed has been accused of plagiarizing original content from competitors throughout the online and offline press on june   gawkers adrian chen posted a story entitled buzzfeed and the plagiarism problem in the article chen observed that one of buzzfeeds most popular writers‚Äîmatt stopera‚Äîfrequently had copied and pasted chunks of text into lists without attribution on march   the atlantic wire also published an article concerning buzzfeed and plagiarism issues buzzfeed has been the subject of multiple copyright infringement lawsuits for both using content it had no rights to and encouraging its proliferation without attributing its sources one for an individual photographers photograph and another for nine celebrity photographs from a single photography company in july  buzzfeed writer benny johnson was accused of multiple instances of plagiarism two anonymous twitter users chronicled johnson attributing work that was not his own but directly lifted from other reporters wikipedia and yahoo answers all without credit buzzfeed editor ben smith initially defended johnson calling him a deeply original writer days later smith acknowledged that johnson had plagiarized the work of others  times and announced that johnson had been fired and apologized to buzzfeed readers plagiarism much less copying unchecked facts from wikipedia or other sources is an act of disrespect to the reader smith said we are deeply embarrassed and sorry to have misled you in total  instances of plagiarism were found and corrected johnson who had previously worked for the mitt romney  presidential campaign subsequently was hired by the conservative magazine national review as their social media editor in october  it was noted by the pew research center that in the united states buzzfeed was viewed as an unreliable source by the majority of people regardless of political affiliation in april  buzzfeed drew scrutiny after gawker observed the publication had deleted two posts that criticized advertisers one of the posts criticized dove soap manufactured by unilever while another criticized hasbro both companies advertise with buzzfeed ben smith apologized in a memo to staff for his actions i blew it smith wrote twice in the past couple of months ive asked editors‚Äîover their better judgment and without any respect to our standards or process‚Äîto delete recently published posts from the site both involved the same thing my overreaction to questions weve been wrestling with about the place of personal opinion pieces on our site i reacted impulsively when i saw the posts and i was wrong to do that weve reinstated both with a brief note days later one of the authors of the deleted posts arabelle sicardi resigned an internal review by the company found three additional posts deleted for being critical of products or advertisements by microsoft pepsi and unilever in september  the christian post wrote that a video by buzzfeed entitled im christian but im not was getting criticism from conservative christians for not specifically mentioning christ or certain biblical values in  the advertising standards authority of the united kingdom ruled that buzzfeed broke the uk advertising rules for failing to make it clear that an article on  laundry fails weve all experienced that promoted dylon was an online advertorial paid for by the brand although the asa agreed with buzzfeeds defence that links to the piece from its homepage and search results clearly labelled the article as sponsored content this failed to take into account that many people may link to the story directly ruling that the labelling was not sufficient to make clear that the main content of the web page was an advertorial and that editorial content was therefore retained by the advertiser in february  scaachi koul a senior writer for buzzfeed canada tweeted a request for pitches stating that buzzfeed was looking for mostly nonwhite nonmen followed by if you are a white man upset that we are looking mostly for nonwhite nonmen i dont care about you go write for macleans when confronted she followed with the tweet white men are still permitted to pitch i will read it i will consider it im just less interested because ugh men in response to the tweets koul received numerous rape and death threats and racist insults sarmishta subramanian a former colleague of kouls writing for macleans condemned the reaction to the tweets and commented that kouls request for diversity was appropriate subramanian said that her provocative approach raised concerns of tokenism that might hamper buzzfeeds stated goals buzzfeed youtube

conference the publication of the dossier was also met with criticism from among others cnn reporter jake tapper who called it irresponsible buzzfeed editorinchief ben smith defended the sites decision to publish the dossier aleksej gubarev chief of technology company xbt and a figure mentioned in the dossier sued buzzfeed on february   the suit filed in a broward county florida court centers on the allegations from the dossier that xbt had been using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses plant bugs steal data and conduct altering operations against the democratic party leadership traingateedit in september  private eye revealed that a guardian story from august  on traingate was written by a former socialist workers party member who joined the labour party once jeremy corbyn became labour leader the journalist also had a conflict of interest with the individual who filmed corbyn on the floor of an allegedlyovercrowded train something the guardian did not mention in its reporting paul chadwich the global readers editor for the guardian later stated that the story was published too quickly with aspects of the story not being corroborated by thirdparty sources prior to reporting the story proved to be an embarrassment for corbyn and the guardian the story originally was submitted to buzzfeed news who rejected the article because its author had attached a load of conditions around the words and he wanted it written his way according to buzzfeed uk editorinchief janine gibson watermelon stuntedit main article exploding watermelon stunt on april   buzzfeed created a live stream on facebook during which two staffers wrapped rubber bands around a watermelon until the pressure of the rubber bands caused it to explode the stunt was notable for drawing a very large online audience the dressedit main article the dress the most interesting thing to me is that it traveled it went from new york media circlejerk twitter to international and you could see it in my twitter notifications because people started having conversations in like spanish and portuguese and then japanese and chinese and thai and arabic it was amazing to watch this move from a local thing to like a massive international phenomenon cates holderness a post resulting in a debate over the color of an item of clothing from buzzfeeds tumblr editor cates holderness garnered more than  million views in one day setting a record for most concurrent visitors to a buzzfeed post holderness had showed the picture to other members of the sites social media team who immediately began arguing about the dress colors among themselves after creating a simple poll for users of the site she left work and took the subway back to her brooklyn home when she got off the train and checked her telephone it was overwhelmed by the messages on various sites i couldnt open twitter because it kept crashing i thought somebody had died maybe i didnt know what was going on later in the evening the page set a new record at buzzfeed for concurrent visitors which would reach  at its peak criticism and controversiesedit benny johnson was fired from buzzfeed in july  for plagiarism buzzfeed has been accused of plagiarizing original content from competitors throughout the online and offline press on june   gawkers adrian chen posted a story entitled buzzfeed and the plagiarism problem in the article chen observed that one of buzzfeeds most popular writers‚Äîmatt stopera‚Äîfrequently had copied and pasted chunks of text into lists without attribution on march   the atlantic wire also published an article concerning buzzfeed and plagiarism issues buzzfeed has been the subject of multiple copyright infringement lawsuits for both using content it had no rights to and encouraging its proliferation without attributing its sources one for an individual photographers photograph and another for nine celebrity photographs from a single photography company in july  buzzfeed writer benny johnson was accused of multiple instances of plagiarism two anonymous twitter users chronicled johnson attributing work that was not his own but directly lifted from other reporters wikipedia and yahoo answers all without credit buzzfeed editor ben smith initially defended johnson calling him a deeply original writer days later smith acknowledged that johnson had plagiarized the work of others  times and announced that johnson had been fired and apologized to buzzfeed readers plagiarism much less copying unchecked facts from wikipedia or other sources is an act of disrespect to the reader smith said we are deeply embarrassed and sorry to have misled you in total  instances of plagiarism were found and corrected johnson who had previously worked for the mitt romney  presidential campaign subsequently was hired by the conservative magazine national review as their social media editor in october  it was noted by the pew research center that in the united states buzzfeed was viewed as an unreliable source by the majority of people regardless of political affiliation in april  buzzfeed drew scrutiny after gawker observed the publication had deleted two posts that criticized advertisers one of the posts criticized dove soap manufactured by unilever while another criticized hasbro both companies advertise with buzzfeed ben smith apologized in a memo to staff for his actions i blew it smith wrote twice in the past couple of months ive asked editors‚Äîover their better judgment and without any respect to our standards or process‚Äîto delete recently published posts from the site both involved the same thing my overreaction to questions weve been wrestling with about the place of personal opinion pieces on our site i reacted impulsively when i saw the posts and i was wrong to do that weve reinstated both with a brief note days later one of the authors of the deleted posts arabelle sicardi resigned an internal review by the company found three additional posts deleted for being critical of products or advertisements by microsoft pepsi and unilever in september  the christian post wrote that a video by buzzfeed entitled im christian but im not was getting criticism from conservative christians for not specifically mentioning christ or certain biblical values in  the advertising standards authority of the united kingdom ruled that buzzfeed broke the uk advertising rules for failing to make it clear that an article on  laundry fails weve all experienced that promoted dylon was an online advertorial paid for by the brand although the asa agreed with buzzfeeds defence that links to the piece from its homepage and search results clearly labelled the article as sponsored content this failed to take into account that many people may link to the story directly ruling that the labelling was not sufficient to make clear that the main content of the web page was an advertorial and that editorial content was therefore retained by the advertiser in february  scaachi koul a senior writer for buzzfeed canada tweeted a request for pitches stating that buzzfeed was looking for mostly nonwhite nonmen followed by if you are a white man upset that we are looking mostly for nonwhite nonmen i dont care about you go write for macleans when confronted she followed with the tweet white men are still permitted to pitch i will read it i will consider it im just less interested because ugh men in response to the tweets koul received numerous rape and death threats and racist insults sarmishta subramanian a former colleague of kouls writing for macleans condemned the reaction to the tweets and commented that kouls request for diversity was appropriate subramanian said that her provocative approach raised concerns of tokenism that might hamper buzzfeeds stated goals buzzfeed youtube channels buzzfeedvideo website httpswwwbuzzfeedcom youtube information channel buzzfeedvideo channel

buzzfeed ben smith apologized in a memo to staff for his actions i blew it smith wrote twice in the past couple of months ive asked editors‚Äîover their better judgment and without any respect to our standards or process‚Äîto delete recently published posts from the site both involved the same thing my overreaction to questions weve been wrestling with about the place of personal opinion pieces on our site i reacted impulsively when i saw the posts and i was wrong to do that weve reinstated both with a brief note days later one of the authors of the deleted posts arabelle sicardi resigned an internal review by the company found three additional posts deleted for being critical of products or advertisements by microsoft pepsi and unilever in september  the christian post wrote that a video by buzzfeed entitled im christian but im not was getting criticism from conservative christians for not specifically mentioning christ or certain biblical values in  the advertising standards authority of the united kingdom ruled that buzzfeed broke the uk advertising rules for failing to make it clear that an article on  laundry fails weve all experienced that promoted dylon was an online advertorial paid for by the brand although the asa agreed with buzzfeeds defence that links to the piece from its homepage and search results clearly labelled the article as sponsored content this failed to take into account that many people may link to the story directly ruling that the labelling was not sufficient to make clear that the main content of the web page was an advertorial and that editorial content was therefore retained by the advertiser in february  scaachi koul a senior writer for buzzfeed canada tweeted a request for pitches stating that buzzfeed was looking for mostly nonwhite nonmen followed by if you are a white man upset that we are looking mostly for nonwhite nonmen i dont care about you go write for macleans when confronted she followed with the tweet white men are still permitted to pitch i will read it i will consider it im just less interested because ugh men in response to the tweets koul received numerous rape and death threats and racist insults sarmishta subramanian a former colleague of kouls writing for macleans condemned the reaction to the tweets and commented that kouls request for diversity was appropriate subramanian said that her provocative approach raised concerns of tokenism that might hamper buzzfeeds stated goals buzzfeed youtube channels buzzfeedvideo website httpswwwbuzzfeedcom youtube information channel buzzfeedvideo
