ryan by exploring the world of a hitherto obscure black harbor pilot this book emphasizes the history of the american revolution in the south the world of thomas jeremiah charles town on the eve of the american revolution william r ryan description this book profiles the port of charles town south carolina during the twoyear period leading up to the declaration of independence it focuses on the dramatic hanging and burning of thomas jeremiah a free black harbor pilot and firefighter accused by the patriot party of plotting a slave insurrection during the tumultous spring and summer of  to examine the world of this wealthy slaveholding african american through his trial and execution william r ryan uses a wide array of letters naval records personal and official correspondence memoirs and newspapers he shows that the black majority of the south carolina low country managed to assist the british in their invasion efforts despite patriot attempts to frighten afrocarolinians into passivity and submission although whigs attempted through brutality and violence to keep their slaves from participating in the conflict afrocarolinians became actively involved in the struggle between colonists and the crown as spies messengers navigators and marauders the book demonstrates that an understanding of what was going on in this vital seaport during the mids has broader implications for the study of the atlantic world african american history naval history urban race relations labor history and the turbulent politics of americas move toward independence show more the

william r ryan author information william r ryan has taught colonial american history at duke university and north carolina state university the world of thomas jeremiah charles town on the eve of the american revolution william r ryan reviews and awards finalist for the george c rogers jr book award the authors greatest success is finally putting to bed the idea that south carolinas patriot leaders were able to conduct their revolution almost entirely as they wished here we see them desperately trying to manage the demands of artisans and sea captains at the same time as they struggled with the inherent contradictions that arose when a group of slaveholders joined a movement whose purpose was to seek liberty from an oppressorlabor superbly researched and arguedthe south carolina historical magazine ryan has created a work that gets to the heart of revolutionary movements his study reveals the divisions and social stresses in the southern colonies delves into the psychology of slaveholders in prerevolutionary charleston highlights the dilemmas of the free and enslaved laborers in the low country of south carolina and determines the motivations of those who participated in the revolution as such it will be of interest to sociologists political scientists cultural studies scholars and historians alikejournal of interdisciplinary history there have been a number of books published about colonial and revolutionary south carolina however not since richard walshs charlestons sons of liberty  has a scholar so effectively dealt with the citys underclasses and their relationship with the colonys ruling elite ryan not only enters the world of thomas jeremiah effectively but he convinces the reader that jeremiah and his world had a tremendous impact on the wealthiest elite in colonial americawalter b edgar university of south carolina this is an important interesting informative well researched and wellconceived book it is concrete using sources which bring the early years of the american revolution in and near charleston to life it has several important strengths it leaves the usual new england focus behind it emphasizes the racial class and regional dimensions of the american revolution in the southeast emphasizing the strength of afroamericans within the context of demography and their maritime skills especially as pilots in treacherous and ever changing channels and harbor entrancesgwendolyn midlo hall rutgers university recommendedchoice the great strengths of this book lie in the provocative issues raised but left unresolved and in the reminder that the revolutionary era offerednew opportunities to challenge both the institution of chattel bondage and the allied structures of white supremacyjournal of american history a
