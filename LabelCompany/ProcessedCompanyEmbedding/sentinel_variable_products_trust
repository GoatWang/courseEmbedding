accounts covered by the agreement and for compliance with the conditions stated in this application  the use of a common management investment company or investment portfolio thereof as an investment medium for both vli accounts and va accounts of the same participating insurance company or of two or more insurance companies that are affiliated persons of each other is referred to herein as “mixed funding” the use of a common management investment company or investment portfolio thereof as an investment medium for vli accounts andor va accounts of two or more participating insurance companies that are not affiliated persons of each other is referred to herein as “shared funding”  the trust or a future trust may sell its shares directly to the plans ie not to vli accounts or va accounts supporting variable contracts issued to plans as described below federal tax law permits investment companies such as the insurance funds to increase their net assets by selling shares to plans  section h of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” imposes certain diversification standards on the assets underlying variable contracts such as those in each insurance fund the code provides that variable contracts will not be treated as annuity contracts or life insurance contracts as the case may be for any period or any subsequent period for which the underlying assets are not in accordance with regulations issued by the treasury department adequately diversified on march   the treasury department issued regulations treas reg  that established diversification requirements for variable contracts which require the separate accounts upon which these contracts are based to be diversified as provided in the treasury regulations in the case of separate accounts that invest in underlying investment companies the treasury regulations provide a “look through” rule that permits the start printed page separate account to look to the underlying investment company for purposes of meeting the diversification requirements provided that the beneficial interests in the investment company are held only by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies however the treasury regulations also contain certain exceptions to this requirement one of which permits shares in an investment company to be held by a plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company to also be held by separate accounts funding variable contracts treas reg section fiii another exception allows the investment adviser of the investment company and certain companies related to the investment adviser to hold shares of the investment company representing seed capital  plans may invest in shares of an investment company as the sole investment under the plan or as one of several investments plan participants may or may not be given an investment choice depending on the terms of the plan itself the trustees or other fiduciaries of a plan may vote investment company shares held by the plan in their own discretion or if the applicable plan so provides vote such shares in accordance with instructions from participants in such plans applicants have no control over whether trustees or other fiduciaries of plans rather than participants in the plans have the right to vote under any particular plan each plan must be administered in accordance with the terms of the plan and as determined by its trustee or trustees  applicants propose that any insurance fund also be permitted to sell shares to its investment adviser the treasury regulations permit such sales as long as the return on shares held by the adviser is computed in the same manner as shares held by vli accounts and va accounts the adviser does not intend to sell the shares to the public and sales to an investment adviser are only made in connection with the creation or management of the insurance fund for the purpose of providing seed capital  applicants propose that any insurance fund also be permitted to sell shares to the general account of a participating insurance company the treasury regulations also permit such sales as long as the return on shares held by general accounts are computed in the same manner as shares held by vli accounts and va accounts and the participating insurance company does not intend to sell the shares to the public applicants anticipate that sales of shares may be made to general accounts of participating insurance companies in return for seed money  the promulgation of rules eb and etb preceded the issuance of the treasury regulations permitting the shares of insurance funds to be held by a plan an adviser for the fund or the general account of a participating insurance company without adversely affecting the ability of the vli account to also hold shares  the use of a common management investment company or investment portfolio thereof as an investment medium for vli accounts va accounts plans investment advisers and general accounts of participating insurance companies is referred to herein as “extended mixed funding” applicants’ legal analysis  section a of the  act makes it unlawful for any company to serve as an investment adviser or principal underwriter of any investment company including a unit investment trust if an affiliated person of that company is subject to disqualification enumerated in section a or  of the  act sections a a and b of the  act have been deemed by the commission to require “passthrough” voting with respect to an underlying investment companys shares  rule eb under the act provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act to vli accounts supporting scheduled premium vli contracts and to their life insurance company depositors the exemptions granted by the rule are available however only where an insurance fund offers its shares exclusively to vli accounts of the same participating insurance company andor of participating insurance companies that are affiliated persons of the same participating insurance company and then only where scheduled premium vli contracts are issued through such vli accounts therefore vli accounts their depositors and their principal underwriters may not rely on the exemptions provided by rule eb if shares of the insurance fund are held by a vli account through which flexible premium vli contracts are issued a vli account of an unaffiliated participating insurance company an unaffiliated investment adviser any va account or a plan in other words rule eb does not permit a scheduled premium vli account to invest in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for mixed funding extended mixed funding or shared funding  accordingly applicants request an order of the commission granting exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act and rule eb thereunder to the extent necessary to permit a scheduled premium vli account to hold shares of insurance funds when one or more of the following types of investors also hold shares of the insurance funds  va accounts  vli accounts supporting flexible premium vli contracts  va accounts or vli accounts of participating insurance companies that are not affiliated persons of the depositor of the scheduled premium vli account  the general account of a participating insurance company  the investment adviser or an affiliated person of the investment adviser of an insurance fund or  a plan  rule etb under the  act provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act to vli accounts supporting flexible premium variable life insurance contracts and their life insurance company depositors the exemptions granted by the rule are available however only where an insurance fund offers its shares exclusively to vli accounts through which either scheduled premium or flexible premium vli contracts are issued of the same participating insurance company andor of participating insurance companies that are affiliated persons of the same participating insurance company va accounts of the same participating insurance company or of affiliated participating insurance companies or the general account of the same participating insurance company or of affiliated participating insurance companies therefore vli accounts their depositors and their principal underwriters may not rely on the exemptions provided by rule etb if shares of the insurance fund are held by a vli account of an unaffiliated participating insurance company a va account of an unaffiliated participating insurance company the general account of an unaffiliated participating insurance company an unaffiliated investment adviser or a plan in other words rule etb permits vli accounts supporting flexible premium vli contracts to invest in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for mixed funding but does not permit such a vli account to invest in shares of a management start printed page investment company that serves as a vehicle for extended mixed funding or shared funding  accordingly applicants request an order of the commission granting exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act and rule etb and any comparable permanent rule thereunder to the extent necessary to permit a flexible premium vli account to hold shares of insurance funds when one or more of the following types of investors also hold shares of the insurance funds  va accounts  va accounts or vli accounts of participating insurance companies that are not affiliated persons of the depositor of the flexible premium vli account  the general account of a participating insurance company  the investment adviser or an affiliated person of the investment adviser of an insurance fund or  a plan  as explained below applicants maintain that there is no public policy reason why vli accounts and their participating insurance company depositors or principal underwriters should not be able to rely on the exemptions provided by rules eb and etb just because shares of insurance funds held by the vli accounts are also held by a funds investment adviser or affiliated person the general account of the participating insurance company or another participating insurance company or a plan “eligible h purchasers” rather applicants assert that the proposed sale of insurance fund shares to plans may allow for the development of larger pools of assets resulting in the potential for greater investment and diversification opportunities and decreased expenses at higher asset levels similarly applicants believe that the proposed sale of insurance fund shares to investment advisers or their affiliates and general accounts of participating insurance companies for seed money may result in the creation of more insurance funds as investment options for certain va contracts and vli contracts than would otherwise be the case  applicants maintain that the reason the commission did not grant more extensive relief in the area of mixed and shared funding when it adopted rule et is because of the commissions uncertainty in this area with respect to issues such as conflicts of interest applicants believe however that the commissions concern in this area is not warranted here for the reasons explained below applicants have concluded that investment by eligible h purchasers in the insurance funds should not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts between owners of vli contracts and other types of investors or between owners of vli contracts issued by unaffiliated participating insurance companies  pursuant to the commissions authority under section c of the  act to grant exemptive orders to a class or classes of persons and transactions applicants request exemptions for a class of parties consisting of vli accounts their participating insurance company depositors and their principal underwriters  in the context of mixed funding extended mixed funding and shared funding the commission has granted numerous orders of exemption covering a class composed of registered vli accounts their insurance company depositors and principal underwriters applicants assert that the scope of the exemptions and the conditions proposed in their application are largely identical to these precedents applicants believe that the same policies and considerations that led the commission to grant such exemptions to other similarly situated applicants are present should apply here  section c of the  act provides in part that the commission by order upon application may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision or provisions of the  act or any rule or regulation thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act the applicants submit that the exemptions requested are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act  section a of the  act provides among other things that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered openend investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections a or  rules ebi and ii and rules etbi and ii under the  act provide exemptions from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations discussed above on mixed funding extended mixed funding and shared funding these exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in management of the underlying investment company  the relief provided by rules ebi and etbi permits a person that is disqualified under sections a or  of the act to serve as an officer director or employee of the life insurance company or any of its affiliates as long as that person does not participate directly in the management or administration of the underlying investment company the relief provided by rules ebii and etbii under the  act permits the life insurance company to serve as the underlying investment companys investment adviser or principal underwriter provided that none of the insurers personnel who are ineligible pursuant to section a participates in the management or administration of the investment company  in effect the partial relief granted in rules eb and etb under the  act from the requirements of section  of the  act limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section  to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section  those rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act to apply the provisions of section a to all individuals in a large insurance complex most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in that organization applicants assert that it is also unnecessary to apply section a of the  act to the many individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies or affiliated companies of participating insurance companies that may utilize the insurance funds as investment vehicles for vli accounts and va accounts applicants maintain there is no regulatory purpose served in extending the monitoring requirements to embrace a full application of section as eligibility restrictions because of mixed funding extended mixed funding or shared funding the participating insurance companies and plans are not expected to play any role in the management of the insurance funds those individuals who participate in the management of the insurance funds will remain the same regardless of which va accounts vli accounts plans or other eligible h purchasers invest in the insurance funds applicants assert that applying the start printed page monitoring requirements of section a of the act because of investment by vli accounts would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose furthermore the increased monitoring costs could reduce the net rates of return realized by owners of vli contracts and plan participants  rules ebiii and etbiii under the  act provide exemptions from passthrough voting requirements with respect to several significant matters assuming the limitations on mixed funding extended mixed funding and shared funding are observed rules ebiiia and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its variable life insurance contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying investment company or any contract between such an investment company and its investment adviser when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority subject to the provisions of paragraphs bi and biia of rules e and et  rules ebiiib and etbiiia provide that an insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of owners of its variable life insurance contracts if such owners initiate any change in an underlying investment companys investment policies principal underwriter or any investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs bii biib and biic of rules e and et  in the case of a change in the investment policies of the underlying investment company the insurance company in order to disregard contract owner voting instructions must make a good faith determination that such a change either would  violate state law or  result in investments that either a would not be consistent with the investment objectives of its separate account or b would vary from the general quality and nature of investments and investment techniques used by other separate accounts of the company or of an affiliated life insurance company with similar investment objectives  both rule e and rule et generally recognize that a variable life insurance contract is primarily a life insurance contract containing many important elements unique to life insurance contracts and subject to extensive state insurance regulation in adopting subparagraph biii of these rules the commission implicitly recognized that state insurance regulators have authority pursuant to state insurance laws or regulations to disapprove or require changes in investment policies investment advisers or principal underwriters  applicants assert that the sale of insurance fund shares to eligible h purchasers will not have any impact on the exemptions requested herein regarding the disregard of passthrough voting rights shares sold to plans will be held by such plans applicants believe that the exercise of voting rights by plans whether by trustees participants beneficiaries or investment managers engaged by the plans does not raise the type of issues respecting disregard of voting rights that are raised by vli accounts with respect to plans which are not registered as investment companies under the  act there is no requirement to pass through voting rights to plan participants indeed to the contrary applicable law expressly reserves voting rights associated with plan assets to certain specified persons under section a of the employee retirement income security act of  “erisa” shares of a portfolio of an investment company sold to a plan must be held by the trusts funding the plan section a also provides that the trustees of such trusts must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the plan with two exceptions  when the plan expressly provides that the trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the plan and not contrary to erisa and  when the authority to manage acquire or dispose of assets of the plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to section c of erisa unless one of the above two exceptions stated in section a applies plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting investment company shares or related proxies held by their plan  where a plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants do not see any potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among the variable contract owners and plan participants with respect to voting of the respective insurance fund shares accordingly unlike the circumstances surrounding vli accounts and va accounts because plans are not required to pass through voting rights to participants applicants believe that the issue of resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts of interest should not arise with respect to voting insurance fund shares  in addition if a plan were to hold a controlling interest in an insurance fund applicants do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in such insurance fund to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the shares of any openend management investment company in this regard applicants submit that investment in an insurance fund by a plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by vli account investments in the fund unlike vli account investments plan voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of participating insurance companies or state insurance regulators  where a plan provides participants with the right to instruct the trustees as to how to vote insurance fund shares applicants see no reason why such participants generally or those in a particular plan either as a single group or in combination with participants in other plans would vote in a manner that would disadvantage vli contract owners applicants believe that the purchase of shares by plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding  similarly an investment adviser to an insurance fund or its affiliates and the general accounts of participating insurance companies are not subject to any passthrough voting requirements accordingly applicants submit that unlike the circumstances surrounding vli account and va account investments in insurance fund shares investment in such shares by eligible h purchasers should not raise issues of resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts of interest with respect to voting  applicants recognize that the commissions primary concern with respect to mixed funding extended mixed funding and shared funding issues is the potential for irreconcilable conflicts between the interests of owners of variable life insurance contracts and those of other investors in an open end investment company serving as an investment vehicle for such contracts applicants submit that the prohibitions on mixed and shared funding might reflect concern regarding possible different investment motivations among investors when rule e was first adopted variable annuity separate accounts could invest in mutual funds whose shares were also offered to the general public therefore the commission staff may have been start printed page concerned with the potentially different investment motivations of public shareholders and owners of variable life insurance contracts applicants submit there also may have been some concern with respect to the problems of permitting a state insurance regulatory authority to affect the operations of a publicly available mutual fund and the investment decisions of public shareholders  for reasons unrelated to the  act however revenue ruling  sept   effectively deprived variable annuity contracts funded by publicly available mutual funds of their taxbenefited status the tax reform act of  codified the prohibition against the use of publicly available mutual funds as an investment vehicle for both variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance contracts in particular section h of the code in effect requires that the investments made by both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts be “adequately diversified” if such a separate account is organized as part of a “twotiered” arrangement where the account invests in shares of an underlying openend investment company ie an underlying fund the diversification test will be applied to the underlying fund or to each of several underlying funds rather than to the separate account itself but only if “all of the beneficial interests” in the underlying fund “are held by one or more insurance companies or affiliated companies in their general account or in segregated asset accounts” accordingly a separate account that invests in a publicly available mutual fund will not be adequately diversified for these purposes as a result any underlying fund including any insurance fund that sells shares to va accounts or vli accounts would in effect be precluded from also selling its shares to the public consequently the insurance funds may not sell their shares to the public  applicants submit that the rights of an insurance company or a state insurance regulator to disregard the voting instructions of owners of variable contracts is not inconsistent with either mixed funding or shared funding the national association of insurance commissioners variable life insurance model regulation the “naic model regulation” suggests that it is unlikely that insurance regulators would find an underlying funds investment policy investment adviser or principal underwriter objectionable for one type of variable contract but not another type the naic model regulation has long permitted the use of a single underlying fund for different separate accounts moreover article vi section  of the naic model regulation has been amended to remove a previous prohibition on one separate account investing in another separate account lastly the naic model regulation does not distinguish between scheduled premium and flexible premium variable life insurance contracts applicants contend that the naic model regulation therefore reflects the naics apparent confidence that such combined funding is appropriate and that state insurance regulators can adequately protect the interests of owners of all variable contracts  applicants submit that shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all states a particular state insurance regulator could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other states in which the insurance company offers its contracts however applicants believe that the fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different states does not create a significantly different or enlarged problem  applicants submit that shared funding by unaffiliated insurers in this respect is no different than the use of the same investment company as the funding vehicle for affiliated insurers which rules eb and etb permit affiliated insurers may be domiciled in different states and be subject to differing state law requirements affiliation does not reduce the potential if any exists for differences in state regulatory requirements in any event the conditions set forth below are designed to safeguard against and provide procedures for resolving any adverse effects that differences among state regulatory requirements may produce if a particular state insurance regulators decision conflicts with the majority of other state regulators then the affected participating insurance company will be required to withdraw its separate account investments in the relevant insurance fund this requirement will be provided for in the participation agreement that will be entered into by participating insurance companies with the relevant insurance fund  rules eb and etb give the participating insurance company the right to disregard the voting instructions of vli contract owners in certain circumstances this right derives from the authority of state insurance regulators over vli accounts and va accounts under rules eb and etb a participating insurance company may disregard vli contract owner voting instructions only with respect to certain specified items applicants maintain that affiliation does not eliminate the potential if any exists for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies principal underwriter or investment adviser initiated by such contract owners the potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in rules e and et that the participating insurance companys disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations  a particular participating insurance companys disregard of voting instructions nevertheless could conflict with the voting instructions of a majority of vli contract owners the participating insurance companys action possibly could be different than the determination of all or some of the other participating insurance companies including affiliated insurers that the voting instructions of vli contract owners should prevail and either could preclude a majority vote approving the change or could represent a minority view if the participating insurance companys judgment represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote then the participating insurance company may be required at the relevant insurance funds election to withdraw its vli accounts and va accounts investments in the relevant insurance fund no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal this requirement will be provided for in the participation agreement entered into by the participating insurance companies with the relevant insurance fund  applicants submit that there is no reason why the investment policies of an insurance fund would or should be materially different from what these policies would or should be if the insurance fund supported only va accounts or vli accounts whether flexible premium or scheduled premium vli contrasts each type of insurance contract is designed as a longterm investment program  applicants represent that each insurance fund will be managed to attempt to achieve its specified investment objective and not favor or disfavor any particular participating insurance company or type of insurance contract applicants contend that there is no reason to believe that different features of various types of variable contracts will lead to different start printed page investment policies for each or for different vli accounts and va accounts the sale of variable contracts and ultimate success of all va accounts and vli accounts depends at least in part on satisfactory investment performance which provides an incentive for each participating insurance company to seek optimal investment performance  applicants represent that no single investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular variable contract each “pool” of vli contract and va contract owners is composed of individuals of diverse financial status age insurance needs and investment goals an insurance fund supporting even one type of variable contract must accommodate these diverse factors in order to attract and retain purchasers applicants contend that permitting mixed and shared funding will provide economic support for the continuation of the insurance funds and will broaden the base of potential variable contract owner investors which may facilitate the establishment of additional insurance funds serving diverse goals  applicants do not believe that the sale of the shares to plans will increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors in particular applicants see very little potential for such conflicts beyond those that would otherwise exist between owners of vli contracts and va contracts applicants submit that either there are no conflicts of interest or that there exists the ability by the affected parties to resolve such conflicts consistent with the best interests of vli contract owners va contract owners and plan participants  applicants considered whether there are any issues raised under the code treasury regulations or revenue rulings thereunder if plans va accounts and vli accounts all invest in the same insurance fund section h of the code is the culmination of a series of revenue rulings aimed at the control of investments by owners of variable contracts and discusses insurance company separate accounts treasury regulation fiii which establishes the diversification requirements for underlying funds specifically permits among other things “qualified pension or retirement plans” separate accounts to invest in the same underlying fund applicants have concluded for this reason that neither the code nor the treasury regulations nor revenue rulings thereunder present any inherent conflicts of interest if plans vli accounts and va accounts all invest in the same insurance fund  applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions from vli accounts and plans are taxed these differences have no impact on the insurance funds when distributions are to be made and a vli account or plan is unable to net purchase payments to make distributions the vli account or plan will redeem shares of the relevant insurance fund at its net asset values in conformity with rule c under the act without the imposition of any sales charge to provide proceeds to meet distribution needs a participating insurance company will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of its vli contract and a plan will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of the plan  applicants considered whether it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving voting rights to vli contract owners and plans in connection with any meeting of insurance fund shareholders the funds transfer agent will inform each participating insurance company and other eligible h purchaser of their share holdings and provide other information necessary for such shareholders to participate in the meeting eg proxy materials each participating insurance company then will solicit voting instructions from owners of vli contracts and va contracts as required by either rules e or et or section deiiiaa of the act as applicable and its participation agreement with the relevant insurance fund shares held by a participating insurance company general account will be voted by the company in the same proportion of shares for which it receives voting instructions from its variable contract owners shares held by plans will be voted in accordance with applicable law the voting rights provided to plans with respect to the shares would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to plans with respect to shares of mutual funds sold to the general public furthermore if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a plans decision to disregard plan participant voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the plan may be required at the election of the relevant insurance fund to withdraw its investment in the insurance fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal  applicants do not believe that the veto power of state insurance commissioners over certain potential changes to insurance fund investment objectives approved by owners of vli contracts creates conflicts between the interests of such owners and the interests of plan participants applicants note that a basic premise of corporate democracy and shareholder voting is that not all shareholders may agree with a particular proposal their interests and opinions may differ but this does not mean that inherent conflicts of interest exist between or among such shareholders or that occasional conflicts of interest that do occur between or among them are likely to be irreconcilable  applicants represent that although participating insurance companies may have to overcome regulatory impediments in redeeming shares of an insurance fund held by their vli accounts the plans and the participants in participantdirected plans can make decisions quickly and redeem their shares in a fund and reinvest in another investment company or other funding vehicle without impediments or as is the case with most plans hold cash pending suitable investment as a result conflicts between the interests of vli contract owners and the interests of plans and plan participants can usually be resolved quickly since the plans can on their own redeem their insurance fund shares  finally applicants considered whether there is a potential for future conflicts of interest between participating insurance companies and plans created by future changes in the tax laws applicants do not see any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts arising between the interests of vli contract owners or for that matter va contract owners and plan participants from future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exists between vli contract owners and va contract owners  applicants recognize that the issues described above are not allinclusive but rather are representative of issues that they believe are relevant to the application in light of the above applicants believe that the sale of insurance fund shares to plans trustees would not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts between the interests of plan participants and vli contract owners or other investors further applicants submit that the use of the insurance funds with respect to plans is not substantially dissimilar from each insurance funds anticipated start printed page use in that plans like vli accounts are generally longterm investors  applicants represent that a potential source of initial capital is an insurance funds investment adviser or a participating insurance company either of these parties may have an interest in making a capital investment and in assisting an insurance fund in its organization however provision of seed capital or the purchase of shares in connection with the management of an insurance fund by its investment adviser or by a participating insurance company may be deemed to violate the exclusivity requirement of rule eb andor rule etb  applicants assert that permitting an insurance fund to sell its shares to its investment adviser or the advisers affiliates or to the general account of a participating insurance company for the purpose of obtaining seed money will enhance management of each insurance fund without raising significant concerns regarding material irreconcilable conflicts among different types of investors  given the conditions of treasury regulation f and the harmony of interest between an insurance fund on the one hand and its investment adviser or affiliates or a participating insurance company on the other applicants assert that little incentive for overreaching exists furthermore such investment should not implicate the concerns discussed above regarding the creation of material irreconcilable conflicts instead permitting investments by an investment adviser or its affiliates or by general accounts of participating insurance companies will permit the orderly and efficient creation and operation of an insurance fund and reduce the expense and uncertainty of using outside parties at the early stages of the insurance funds operations  applicants also submit that regardless of the type of shareholder in an insurance fund its investment adviser and the advisers affiliates are or would be contractually and otherwise obligated to manage the insurance fund solely and exclusively in accordance with that funds investment objectives policies and restrictions as well as any guidelines established by the its board of trustees a “board” thus each insurance fund will be managed in the same manner as any other mutual fund  applicants do not believe that the ability of an insurance fund to sell its shares to its investment adviser or an affiliated person of the adviser to plans or to the general account of a participating insurance company gives rise to a senior security a “senior security” is defined in section g of the act to include “any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends” as noted above regardless of the rights and benefits of participants under plans and owners of vli contracts vli accounts va accounts participating insurance companies plans and investment advisers or their affiliates only have or will only have rights with respect to their respective shares of an insurance fund these parties can only redeem such shares at net asset value no shareholder of an insurance fund has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends  in addition applicants note that the commission has issued numerous orders permitting mixed funding extended mixed funding and shared funding therefore applicants submit that granting the exemptions requested herein is in the public interest and as discussed above will not compromise the regulatory purposes of sections a a a or b of the act or rules e or et thereunder applicants conditions applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions which shall apply to the trust as well as any future trust that relies on the order  a majority of the board of each insurance fund will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of the insurance fund as defined by section a of the  act and the rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the commission except that if this condition is not met by reason of death disqualification or bona fide resignation of any trustee or trustees then the operation of this condition will be suspended a for a period of  days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the board b for a period of  days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies or c for such longer period as the commission may prescribe by order upon application or by future rule  the board of each insurance fund will monitor the insurance fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between and among the interests of the owners of all vli contracts and va contracts and participants of all plans investing in the insurance fund and determine what action if any should be taken in response to such conflicts a material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons including a an action by any state insurance regulatory authority b a change in applicable federal or state insurance tax or securities laws or regulations or a public ruling private letter ruling noaction or interpretive letter or any similar action by insurance tax or securities regulatory authorities c an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding d the manner in which the investments of the insurance fund are being managed e a difference in voting instructions given by va contract owners vli contract owners and plans or plan participants f a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners or g if applicable a decision by a plan to disregard the voting instructions of plan participants  participating insurance companies on their own behalf as well as by virtue of any investment of general account assets in an insurance fund an adviser and its affiliates and any plan that executes a participation agreement upon its becoming an owner of  or more of the net assets of an insurance fund collectively “participants” will report any potential or existing conflicts to the board of the insurance fund each participant will be responsible for assisting the board in carrying out the boards responsibilities under these conditions by providing the board with all information reasonably necessary for the board to consider any issues raised this responsibility includes but is not limited to an obligation by each participating insurance company to inform the board whenever variable contract owner voting instructions are disregarded and if passthrough voting is applicable an obligation by each plan to inform the board whenever it has determined to disregard plan participant voting instructions the responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the board will be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their participation agreement with an insurance fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the variable contract owners the responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the board also will be contractual obligations of all plans under their participation agreement with an insurance fund and such agreements will provide that these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of plan participants  if it is determined by a majority of the board of an insurance fund or a start printed page majority of the disinterested directorstrustees of such board that a material irreconcilable conflict exists then the relevant participant will at its expense and to the extent reasonably practicable as determined by a majority of the disinterested directorstrustees take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict up to and including a withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of their vli accounts or va accounts from the insurance fund and reinvesting such assets in a different investment vehicle including another insurance fund b in the case of a participating insurance company submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected variable contract owners and as appropriate segregating the assets of any appropriate group ie va contract owners or vli contract owners of one or more participating insurance companies that votes in favor of such segregation or offering to the affected contract owners the option of making such a change c withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the plans from the affected insurance fund and reinvesting them in a different investment medium and d establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard variable contract owner voting instructions and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote then the participating insurance company may be required at the election of the insurance fund to withdraw such participating insurance companys va account and vli account investments in the insurance fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a plans decision to disregard plan participant voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the plan may be required at the election of the insurance fund to withdraw its investment in the insurance fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal the responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action will be a contractual obligation of all participants under their participation agreement with an insurance fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of variable contract owners or as applicable plan participants for purposes of this condition  a majority of the disinterested directorstrustees of the board of each insurance fund will determine whether or not any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict but in no event will the insurance fund or its investment adviser be required to establish a new funding vehicle for any variable contract or plan no participating insurance company will be required by this condition  to establish a new funding vehicle for any variable contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict further no plan will be required by this condition  to establish a new funding vehicle for the plan if a a majority of the plan participants materially and adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict vote to decline such offer or b pursuant to documents governing the plan the plan trustee makes such decision without a plan participant vote  the board of each insurance funds determination of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications will be made known in writing promptly to all participants  participating insurance companies will provide passthrough voting privileges to all variable contract owners whose contracts are issued through registered vli accounts or registered va accounts for as long as required by the act as interpreted by the commission however as to variable contracts issued through va accounts or vli accounts not registered as investment companies under the act passthrough voting privileges will be extended to owners of such contracts to the extent granted by the participating insurance company accordingly such participating insurance companies where applicable will vote the shares of each insurance fund held in their vli accounts and va accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from variable contract owners participating insurance companies will be responsible for assuring that each of their vli and va accounts investing in an insurance fund calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other participating insurance companies investing in that fund the obligation to calculate voting privileges as provided in this application shall be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their participation agreement with the fund each participating insurance company will vote shares of each insurance fund held in its vli or va accounts for which no timely voting instructions are received as well as shares held by its general account or otherwise attributed to it in the same proportion as those shares for which voting instructions are received each plan will vote as required by applicable law governing plan documents and as provided in this application  as long as the act requires passthrough voting privileges to be provided to variable contract owners or the commission interprets the act to require the same an insurance fund investment adviser or its affiliates or any general account will vote their shares of the fund in the same proportion as all votes cast on behalf of all variable contract owners having voting rights provided however that such an investment adviser or affiliates shall vote its shares in such other manner as may be required by the commission or its staff  each insurance fund will comply with all provisions of the act requiring voting by shareholders which for these purposes shall be the persons having a voting interest in its shares and in particular the insurance fund will either provide for annual meetings except to the extent that the commission may interpret section  of the act not to require such meetings or comply with section c of the act although each insurance fund is not or will not be one of those trusts of the type described in section c of the act as well as with section a of the act and if and when applicable section b of the act further each insurance fund will act in accordance with the commissions interpretations of the requirements of section a with respect to periodic elections of

board will monitor events in order to identify the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts and to determine what action if any should be taken in response to any such conflicts  if and to the extent rule e and rule et under the act are amended or rule e under the act is adopted to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the act or the rules thereunder with respect to mixed or shared funding on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested in this application then each insurance fund andor participating insurance companies as appropriate shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with rules e or et as amended or rule e to the extent such rules are applicable  each participant at least annually shall submit to the
