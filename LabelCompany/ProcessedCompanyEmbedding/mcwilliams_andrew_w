cartwright good morning in addition to andrew i’m here today with our chief financial officer kirk manz and other members of our executive management team kirk and i each have some remarks about the third quarter after that we will open the line for your questions i’d like to begin with some comments about the california matter on july   a california corp unsealed a criminal indictment against several of our subsidiaries this indictment was unprecedented for any healthcare company in spite of the unfortunate and expensive distraction we managed to continually grow bed capacity and admission since the indictment in this past quarter one of our former employees went to trial that trial ended up in hung jury with  of the  juries voting to acquit this favorable outcome helped trump productive settlement discussions with the attorney general of the state of california on october  we reached a resolution that resulted in all charges being dismissed against the corporate entities we are pleased to put this matter behind us and to clear the aac holding subsidiaries we can now fully focus our commitment and passion on serving clients and their families who are overwhelmed by addiction in california and throughout the united states moving on to our longitudinal outcome study and our commitment to client quality we are now tracking approximately  clients up from  clients from q as previously stated we expect to begin sharing initial results for six month follow ups on our fourth quarter investor call now to q performance residential client admissions totaled  in the third quarter a  increase yearoveryear and up  over the second quarter average daily residential census was  in the third quarter up  yearoveryear and up  sequentially total residential bed capacity at the end of the third quarter was  up  yearoveryear and flat to second quarter effective bed capacity which is based upon our staffing levels was  at the end of the third quarter effective bed utilization was  for the third quarter effective utilization at our legacy treatment centers which includes all facilities opened or acquired before  was  keep in mind that we have expanded our effective bed capacity by  in just the past year and that we would expect utilization drop in the nearterm in an effort to streamline operations on the east coast of florida we have transferred single items operations into our recovery first operation this consolidation converts  out of network beds into innetwork beds we expect this to be financially neutral event innetwork beds now represent  of our total residential bed capacity average daily residential revenue was  for the third quarter down  yearoveryear and down  sequentially innetwork revenue accounted for  of our client related revenue during the quarter up  from a year ago we had  outpatient visits for the third quarter up  yearoveryear and up  sequentially outpatient revenue was  of total client related revenue up from  a year ago we consider our ma pipeline to be robust with the expansion of our credit facility in july and the california litigation now settled we would expect to significantly increase growth through acquisitions in  in reviewing our de novo pipeline i would like to highlight that we are ahead of schedule with our various construction projects our sobre living bed expansions in both resolution las vegas and resolution arlington have progressed substantially these renovations are occurring at a phased approach to enable us to bring on beds faster we now have  sober beds online at resolution las vegas and  sober living beds online at resolutions arlington we currently anticipate those bed counts to expand at  beds at each location by the end of q  at oxford we are pleased to report that we have recently completed and brought online  residential beds an additional  detox bed and  sober living beds should be completed by end of q  turning our attention to ringwood we believe that we are making great progress in the construction of  beds and we are moving up on anticipated completion date to the first quarter of  let me be crystal clear the third quarter did not meet our expectations we did not ramp our outpatient visits in laguna as much as we had hoped our expenses came in higher than i would have liked and our lab revenue dropped more than expected while i’ll admit the california took up a lot of management time and that was a strong factor we put that matter behind us and we are focused on growing our business currently we have over  residential and sober living beds in the pipeline which will be funded by our credit lines this represents approximately a  increase in our capacity within the next  months between our current ma and de novo pipelines and due to the settlement of the california matter we are very excited about our growth prospects for  and beyond with that said let me turn the call over to kirk manz to talk more about our financial highlights kirk r manz thanks michael our revenue for the third quarter of  was  million compared with  million in the prior year period a  increase yearoveryear and down  sequentially while facility and outpatient revenue increased by  million in the third quarter ancillary client related revenue which includes drug testing lab revenue and professional services decreased  million in the quarter to  of total client related revenue compared to  of total client related revenue for the second quarter adjusted ebitda for the third quarter was  million a  increase yearoveryear and down  sequentially adjusted eps was  for the third quarter compared with  a year ago and  in the second quarter salaries wages and benefits were  million which were relatively flat versus second quarter and in line with the guidance we previously provided on these expenses for the second half of  client related services in the third quarter increased sequentially by  million due to our de novo and expansion activities and a full quarter impact of client related activities associated with solutions treatment centers that was acquired in may  net loss available to common stockholders was  million for the quarter on a per diluted share basis net loss available to common stockholders was a negative  compared with net income available to common shareholders of  a year ago and  in the second quarter for the third quarter litigation in california legal expenses totaled  million and had a negative impact of  on our eps in total we have spent  million on the california matter which had a cumulative impact of a negative  on eps aac’s tax rate for q was  compared with  in the prior year we now anticipate an annual effective tax rate of  to  for the year cash used by operating activities was  million for the third quarter compared with cash used by operating activities of  a year ago and  million provided by operating activities in the second quarter cash outlays for the california matter was  million in the third quarter now that the california matter is settled we anticipate being able to allocate those cash flows to new growth in  dsos were a  days for the second quarter compared with  days a year ago and  days in the second quarter dsos at legacy facilities were  days down from  days in the second quarter the increase in dsos was related to acquired ar de novo projects and slower lab collections our provision for doubtful accounts was  million or  of revenue down from  million or a  from the prior year period we had  million of cash at quarter end with outstanding debt inclusive of our senior credit facility in deerfield convertible notes of  million our total leverage ratio at quarter end was  times trailing  months adjusted ebitda and senior leverage was  times based on these results and activity we are modifying our full year guidance and assumptions for  due to lower than originally forecasted lab contribution and slower ramping of our outpatient business in laguna we are revising our full year  revenue guidance to  million to  million our adjusted ebitda guidance to  million to  million and our adjusted eps guidance to  to  this outlook does not include the impact of any future acquisitions transaction related costs litigation settlement expenses related to legal defense and de novo startup expenses i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions today’s first question comes from ryan daniels of william blair please go ahead ryan daniels hey good morning thanks for taking the questions kirk maybe a follow up for you i want to make sure i got some of these numbers correct but did you indicate that outpatient and other was up about  million but ancillary overall was down  million so is that  million delta purely lab pricing pressure kirk r manz no no the facility revenue was up over  million and the lab revenue was down roughly  million which is why even though our admissions were up and census was up over the quarter we ended up relatively flat to slightly down to the prior quarter in terms of revenue those two kind of offset each other ryan daniels okay and then the lab pricing i guess is probably the key focus this morning because pricing pressure has a direct impact on the bottom line although it’s not hurting your revenue guidance too much clearly your ebitda is down quite a bit so can you give us a little bit more color on when you started to see that how quickly it manifested and then you give us comfort i guess if that’s going to stabilize or could get it worse going forward how do you think about that kirk r manz you know the first half of the year was relatively stable and then we looked at the second half we thought we would get to the low s by the end of the year and it got there three months earlier than we thought we’ve yet to really kind of ramp our third party lab revenue to help offset the reimbursement declines which is kind of a major focus for us so we thought we get in to low s it is in the low s now i would anticipate that it should be fairly stabilized but we’ll see what happens in q ryan daniels that’s the question i mean do you have visibility on how that’s trending could it accelerate and be worst just from a peer pricing or have you seen kind of prices get cut initially and then stabilize andrew w mcwilliams we’re not seeing that i mean what we’ve also seen with cms new guidelines coming out whether recommending going back up on pricing so it’s a combination of things it’s also the insurance companies are wanting more documentation related to the actual test that’s being performed so we feel like that we put systems in place to accommodate the proper issues that the insurance companies are looking for and we feel like that the pricing has become stable and i don’t think it’s any different than what we anticipated that would come kirk pointed out we thought that our third party lab would offset some of that it hasn’t done that we’re trying to ramp the third party lab now that’s kind of really on me and the focus of the company we’re back focused now kind of getting california behind us we will get the third party lab ramped up and then i think you’ll see that will offset some of our losses that we saw in the lab that we do with our own patients ryan daniels okay i know you are probably not prepared to fully give  guidance but michael you indicated you are pretty excited about growth i think the question is q was flat effectively on revenue and ebitda q is kind of guided that way and it seems like the bed growth and some of the expansion is getting eaten up by some of the pricing pressure so how should we think about  from kind of a top and ebitda line growth outlook and what would be your expectation or what would you be disappointed and not to be able to achieve michael t cartwright right in terms of the full guidance for next year not really go out there but what i am excited about is if you take a look at the census levels and you take a look at the new bed that we just brought online in the second half of the year and then on top of the beds that we’re adding in the first half of the year both down at oxford and the construction projects the new sober living bed that we got coming online in arlington and las vegas we have capacity and that’s one thing that we do really well is sales and marketing we’ve always been able to open de novo projects and fill it up laguna did not ramp as quickly as i’d hoped it would ramp in the third quarter that’s really kind of a first for us we’re starting to now see that go in the right direction in the fourth quarter again it’s just getting back focused on blocking and tackling we have capacity and then into next year we have  beds that we’re showing coming along online in  so i think we did  growth this year with really no access to capital markets and i don’t think there is any doubt that we can achieve much better than that in  if we get access to equity markets i think we can do more than that ryan daniels okay maybe last one i’ll hop off so others can ask questions just on laguna obviously that’s slower ramp can you go into detail on that why you think that ramped a little slower did it have to do with the california legislation or is it just the novelty of more of a detox hospital versus kind of a typical residential facility andrew w mcwilliams more associated with accreditation cost of accreditation normally we would get a cost for accreditation for our facilities and because we already have a relationship with them we would easily be able to add a facility under that accreditation we needed as a hospital to get jcaho accreditation that process is a  day process it’s a little bit longer than we had anticipated and they are backed up they haven’t come out to do the survey yet many of the insurance companies won’t certify a patient to go into the hospital unless they are jcaho accredited we will have that resolved in the fourth quarter we’re excited about being able to take more patients into that facility so it’s a combination of focus and then an actual problem was getting jcaho out there and getting our certification done ryan daniels okay that’s helpful thank you guys operator and our next question today comes from paula torch of avondale partners please go ahead paula torch great thanks everybody good morning i guess i want to start off just asking some more questions about the average daily revenue so excluding lab i think you mentioned that it was  higher sequentially which we expected it might be due to laguna having a higher rate offset by some of the innetwork acquisitions that you’ve recently taken on so is that correct and then maybe how should we think about that growing in the fourth quarter and maybe looking out to next year and then i have a follow up on that kirk r manz if you strip out the lab side we have an increase of our facility adr if you kind of look at the different buckets we actually increased our core facility by roughly  on the adr side the lab and the point care was a decrease  and we had another couple of dollars from the professional groups in terms of a decrease which ended up being a net  decrease so on the one hand we had lower than we originally expected lab but on the other hand we were encouraged that our facility adr went up quarteroverquarter paula torch and i guess just in terms of thinking about where that should flush out longerterm excluding lab now can you generate cash and return on capital at a rate of  to  and as the mix of a network kicks that down overtime can you still generate a return at a lower rate just thinking about the residential and excluding the lab at this point andrew w mcwilliams yes absolutely paula i mean i think that whether doing an innetwork facility or an out of network facility we have talked about this before if we’re charging  a day or  a day you can still make margin on that business it’s just different marketing cost and different operating cost to be able to operate that and we’re doing exactly what we said we will do we’re going to take some of our facilities more innetwork we’re going to get a more mix and balanced approach i think we’ve done that and i also think that we’ve had a small miss in the third quarter after being extremely distracted for  i spent a good portion of my third quarter in a trial adding california a lot of our brain power was going into that i hope that you guys are not taking this and blowing this up to more than it is we had some census off a little bit on laguna we need to fill up some more sober living beds that we’re operating in both dallas and texas and we need to continue to execute on our third party lab strategy right and we feel very confident we’ll do that in the fourth quarter and all through  paula torch and just as a follow up on that my sober living beds and you know ramping those up i know you need to sell those up is the marketing different what is sort of going on from that standpoint in terms of what you need to do to help sell those beds andrew w mcwilliams it’s a combination of things its making sure that we get the places renovated and make sure the amenities are there that the sober living program is solid for patients who want to go there versus another sober living operation it’s a new product line for us we’ve tested some variety of different things that so liked that we got the solution to it i think that you’ll see that in the fourth quarter and into next year we’re excited about sober living we’re actually expanding living in oxford mississippi and looking at other markets to do sober living it’s like outpatient we first started going into that if you remember in  we were all residential and then in  we brought online some outpatient and then into  more outpatient and now we have a good full handle on doing standalone outpatient sober living is a new product line we brought on in  we’ll get some of the kinks worked out a bit and execute it and we’ll expand that across the country as well paula torch okay now thank you that’s helpful and then if i might just put another quick one in just on margins i know that we’ve talked about in the past a longterm margin goal of  to  we’re going to be several  basis points below that this year is that still the right goal for margins for the company overtime especially as we continue to add on more innetwork more sober living that’s which might be at lower rates andrew w mcwilliams absolutely it will be it is not just a goal i mean that is what we will achieve and i think as you continue to see us a diversifying other lines of business and innetwork facilities as well as our out of network facilities you will see that margin part of it is just getting the scale and size that we need and i think we’re there we’re seeing that come into play in  i think we’ll see it come into play more so in  when we add  more beds so i don’t think that’s going to be an issue paula torch okay so not much more investment that needs to be made to sort of get us to the low end and you think that could come fairly quickly or there is a lot more maybe  a little bit more to be done to get to the lower end of that range andrew w mcwilliams i think a couple of quarters i mean i think that’s what we’re looking at paula torch okay thank you i’ll let someone ask some questions thanks operator and our next question today comes from ann hynes of mizuho securities please go ahead ann hynes hi so when i look at your  guidance your q ebitda well the guidance implies to q ebitda kind of dropped to  million versus what was reported  million so i guess i mean if you look at your stock price i think what people are doing is taking out  million run rate time is taking by a  and assuming that’s new to  number so i think what would be helpful for investors is one is lab what causing  can you break out what’s causing that sequential drop is it all lab and if it’s all lab andrew w mcwilliams well i think you are missing the math a little bit we’re projecting more like  million not  million for fourth quarter i am trying to understand where you are getting  million ann hynes alright well i’ll check my math but if i can go back to the question with the lab so when you look at the lab you said i think why does it change so rapidly because if i remember when you reported q lab reimbursement you expected to decelerate but it was better than your expectations why did it decelerate so much in q was it a specific payer was it more than one payer kirk r manz you know ann this is a combination of things and we have said earlier the first couple of quarters we had a very stable lab piece of the business i mean i think one of the things that we want to kind of highlight is that we delivered roughly the same ebitda in q versus q and we did it with significantly less lab contribution than we had in the prior quarter in other words we went from  down to  and yet we were able to manage to increase our facility adr by  which help to offset what would have been a larger adr decrease and so we’ve known that we’re going to be in this kind of shifting tide in terms of lab to get to the place of ultimately stabilizing now it’s the master rate that came out obviously an increasing pricing for  and so this isn’t so much as a surprise in the context of  we thought we would get there it’s just more of a surprise in terms of the timing coming on earlier than we expected had that been mitigated over two quarters we would have obviously had a very different ebitda contribution in this quarter so thats all the information that we have right now as it relates to lab but we don’t have any indication right now indicating that we have any other for instance degradation that it is eminent with that we would be talking about on this particular call so we’ll just wait to see how the rest of the quarter plays out andrew w mcwilliams and i just want to clarify and what we’ve proposed is that our revenue for  would be  million to  million and our adjusted ebitda will be  million to  million so i just want to clarify so that would put our fourth quarter guidance at around  million ann hynes okay that’s helpful and can you remind us the negative i think you are seeing it from fair remarks the cash flow that you spend on the california case will be redeployed to growth next year can you remind us of that total amount that you expect to be able to redeploy for development in acquisitions michael t cartwright yes i mean if you take out the california case we would have had close to  millionish free cash flow for the first three quarters so if you run rate that out call it  million plus if we just used free cash flow to reinvest in the business we’d be able to bring on new de novo project every  months to  months based on where we are today obviously we are optimistic that we’ll be able to continue to drive revenue and ebitda and margins in  which we would hope will give us more cash flow to reinvest in the business ann hynes alright and is there anything you want to call on the cost structure i know you had some uptick in medical cost last quarter has that stabilized or any other cost as your client related services right on cost is anything on the cost side do you want to call out andrew w mcwilliams this is andrew on the last quarter we highlighted the health insurance cost and that we did see that rise in q up from q that has stabilized into q and we expect that to stabilize into q the client related expenses did go up this quarter over previous quarter and that was really primarily related to our growth our acquisition de novo as the full quarter of solutions ann hynes alright and then one last question i know you have given your obviously innetwork and out of network as a big topic and you provide your mix as a percentage of client related services does that include lab or exclude lab michael t cartwright well that would include lab but keep in mind on most of the innetwork business and labs are typically negotiated as part of the daily rate ann hynes yes okay michael t cartwright so roughly we added some more innetwork beds when we did a consolidation of indiscernible to recovery first that gives us another  innetwork beds innetwork revenue was right around a quarter of our revenue the beds are now  of our total beds that are out there so obviously from the beginning we’ve stated our goal to diversify our payer mix we made a lot of progress in just really the first couple of years of being public and we continue to look to diversify that in  ann hynes okay great thank you michael t cartwright welcome operator operator instructions our next question comes from john ransom of raymond james please go ahead john ransom hey good morning just want to go back to the census question in our model we only assumed c at  in california so i am still just trying to figure out where the census was light was it what i would call legacy or was it  is there something else that we might be missing in other words we got the laguna ride and yet you missed our census by  so again i am just trying to figure out where that might have been kirk r manz i understand we were at  utilization across all of the beds in terms of our  beds we had  at the legacy facilities so in terms of was there a particular facility that was lighter than the other no there wasn’t it was pretty much spread across the board john ransom okay and i guess the philosophical question is as rates are coming under pressure and as you have to fill more beds what do you think  let’s talk about a c or c what do you think the equilibrium rate is where you trade your call volume for the need to fill beds at a price so where do you think if you had to guess where do you think we end up in terms of and let’s just forget outpatient for a minute but where do we end up in terms of rate either with or without lab however you want to characterize it kirk r manz when you say rate i am missing john ransom rate per day so the rate per day i mean i guess my question is if you have to go to  for your incoming cost versus  does that imply a rate per day that’s  a day  a day is it  once we hit equilibrium on the lab are we just going to have to trade a little bit of price for demand and rate or am i missing something kirk r manz i am digesting the question here so john ransom let me just  in other words at times here you had to fill  beds now you have to fill a  i am assuming that means you have to take a higher percentage of your incoming call volume or andor you do more innetwork and so i think clearly rates are headed down but is it bigger than the bread box or are we over thinking this i mean you are in a position to assess that more than we are so i am kind of curious what your thoughts are michael t cartwright i am not saying where rates are heading down and some of our innetwork facilities were actually getting rate increases so rates themselves at the core facilities i think are very stable and we’re seeing that as we go innetwork in some of our facilities obviously our adr across the system would come down but the pressure has been on the laboratory bringing the rate down further we had anticipated our third party lab which showed that up a little bit again i think that as we continue to bring facilities innetwork the adr goes down a little bit and you are right we need more patients in those innetwork facilities but the cost structure for innetwork versus out of network on a marketing situation is much lower so again i think that we’re making  we’re extrapolating more out of this than it is we’ve had eight quarter successfully of hitting our numbers exactly what the street wanted to see this quarter we’re off a little bit we’re not off by the magnitude of huge amount i think that if you take a look at overall in  for what this company is faced to be able to come back and continually grow the business without access to outside capital we’ve done an extremely good job i am sorry that it’s not exactly where we had hoped in terms of full year guidance sure you will get it back there in fourth quarter we’ll hit our numbers we will come back to  and we’ll be fully focused it’s not  the lab is not deteriorating so much that its causing major calamity in our company that’s not the case whatsoever john ransom and just on the lab numbers i mean if i remember it’s been    and  in the last four quarters so it’s been a hard thing to forecast for i think the street so and going from  to  sequentially is that all payers is it a few payers is it point of care coming down faster than you think or is it the new medicare rates pressuring the high complexity test how do we think about that in a little more depth thanks andrew w mcwilliams this is andrew i would that’s it’s a combination of almost all of the factors that you indicated which between the lab and the point of care certainly reimbursement pressure on the point of care as we’ve indicated in the past and then also on the lab the high complexity lab as well it seem reimbursement pressure there as well and unfortunately it’s not isolated to any one payer its different payers in different states john ransom and if i remember last year you did  million in lab and maybe a third of that was point of care what’s the ratio of point of care this year assuming we think it’s probably down  to  so is that a useful way to think of it if we looked at the total lab revenue this year point of care would be maybe less than  of total lab revenue kirk r manz no its still it’s around  to  in that range john ransom okay and is that where  i mean i assume that was the highest risk piece of the business kirk r manz yes we felt obviously from the beginning that the point of care was the  had a higher exposure than the high complexity there john ransom okay and then my last question is just the question of bank covenants at kind of a  million run rate ebitda where you calculate you are going to be with respect to your bank credit and where do you need to be to feel comfortable that you got some cushion there andrew w mcwilliams this is andrew again on the  based having or similar to the add back that we haven’t adjusted ebitda and so that’s right around  this puts us about it for time john ransom and what’s the covenant  andrew w mcwilliams yes you got that right michael t cartwright and the senior leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was  we have a benefit kind of rolling off of q from last year so we feel we are in good shape on our covenants as it relates to the banks john ransom but i guess the issue would be you are not generating that kind of cash right now with the dsos and you only get a quarter point of cushion i mean is there a cost lever you think you need to look at just to give yourself some cushion michael t cartwright cost lever i am not following john ransom i mean to get to be comfortably into the bank i mean i am just looking at a couple of quarters if dso stay high and ebitda stays in this  range you don’t have a ton of cushion is there anything you are thinking about do you have to look at some cost in the short term just to kind of make sure you stay under that threshold or you think you are okay andrew w mcwilliams i think we are okay i mean i am not seeing what you’re seeing there john i mean i feel like that we are very comfortable in line with our bank covenants we are very in line with what we need from a cash standpoint to operate our business so john ransom i mean the only thing i am seeing is you got a quarter point of cushion which is not a ton kirk r manz understand we expect – we are growing our revenue and improving our ebitda is what we anticipate doing over the course of the next couple of quarter so michael t cartwright and then is kirk outlined earlier yeartodate we spend about  million of cash on california and then we now are just utilizing that
