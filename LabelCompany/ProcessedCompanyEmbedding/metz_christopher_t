what does this guy know about snowmobiling i hope he is committed to quality and not just the bottom line of the income and expense report like claude was this is a very pivotal time for ac as they are rapidly losing market share to polaris and doo i hope chris has what it takes to turn that around todd says   pm welcome chris please remember this is a snowmobile company first and quality pride are paramount in this company i bleed green says   pm hey chris happy customers will take you farther than the bottom line while i know the company needs to make money cutting corners and making an inferior product will close the doors remember that cathead says   pm i hope this is a good move in a time where cats losing snowmobile market share to polaris and ski doo because of significant problems in quality control coupled with higher prices for comparable machines im slightly concerned as the companies under sun capitals umbrella are not exactly lighting their respective industries on fire black and decker was beginning a period of steep decline and kwickset seems to be out over their skis in terms of quality and reliability plus he doesnt seem to have any powersports experience nor ties to the midwest where the manufacturing heart of the business lives all that said i wish him the best of luck and hope that he can be a vital cog in correcting many of the problems that have been plaguing cat since twomey stepped down the first time i hope that he learns to bleed green like all of us vince says   pm just a heads up guys cat is not losing market share as they have been gaining market share the last few years and are nipping at polariss heels to become the  sled manufacturer the article also points out that metz has a good background in manufacturing with some quality companies the man should understand quality sells akrider says   pm his background doesnt exactly seem like a good fit for a powersports company i dont know if this is a good idea or not the companies he worked for in the past sold products to customers who needed those products ie tools door knobs and faucets very few customers need a snowmachine many want a sled and i dont see how hell understand the passion snowmachiners have towards their sleds i dont get all misty eyed over an old faucet i had as a kid or a doorknob for that matter plus it looks like hes skipped around a lot from job to job i dont think thats a good sign either well just have to wait and see how things work out i would have perfered to see someone running the company who worked in either powersports or a more similar industry greg hallstrom says   am i think cat should have appointed cousin joey as the new ceo he lives and breathes snowmobiles ken says   am first off welcome mr metz second i totally agree with what akrider states about the faucet or doorknob i too never got misty eyed over those things i cant explain the passion i have for arctic cat all i know is that it came when i was very young mr metz pay attention to what others have replied on here they are all spot on with their comments lots of concerns and great advise for you you have to understand the passion the arctic cat guys and gals have of course a company needs to show profit and enhance shareholder value this will come by its self with quality products and service take it from an ex controller of a multi million dollar manufacturing company we built quality products and took care of the customer no matter what we did not cut corners we did not have recalls or have to replace many parts i hope and think you understand that it costs the company more in the long run to pay for recalls defective products and upgrades you will lose customers and eventually the doors will close if those things continue make it right the first time and you will have current and new customers for life good luck mr metz and again welcome kevin hooper says   am congratulations to chris metz i have full confidence that after the claude jordan era the ac board sought and found the right person mr metz welcome i respectfully hope you will aggressively follow a plan that provides innovation quality value and care to your dealers and consumers once again congratulations mike f says   pm welcome mr metz i have all the confidence in the world that the board made the right decision this timebut remember ac is not a normal company making simple household items there is an amazing passion here for a company that is different think outside the boxgodspeed jdubs says   am importantly he is adept at creating strong partnerships with customers and dealers lets hope this is true catnation says   am quite concerned yet again they hired someone who has no knowledge of powersports industry great just great tom mahon says   pm leave the green emotions out of it  if ac can not produce differentiated machines with higher levels of comfortpower and convenience they will lose market share  the technology gap is huge just in suspensions acpodo  weight reductions on board controls its amazing the brand is still so strong its still the price leader  david says   am john i think its time for an interview with mr metz the next time your up in trf id be curious as to the last time he rode a sled has he ever bought a new sled trough a dealership or needed warranty work on a sled and has he ever changed a belt or spark plugs on a sled welcome aboard mr metz and keep the track side down dave says   am dear mr metz as a sitting cfo of several successful pe sponsored firms and also a passionate snowmobiler  miles per year i can appreciate the challenges a company like arctic cat has it may seem strange for me to say as a cfo but the answers for success for arctic cat do not emanate from the numbers passion as arctic cat ads proclaim drives this business especially on the snow side i know that the money is made elsewhere but the snow side is and always has been the baseline for arctic cat without that component flourishing from which much of the innovation and customer passion for all the product springs arctic cat will die indeed there are few products in the world with a more passionate and loyal customer base “bleeding green” is no cliché at arctic cat it’s a way of life like harley on steroids… unfortunately there are limits to how much a company can take its customers for granted i have been riding arctic cats since i was  years old and have probably had at least  of them in my lifetime many of which purchased new my last arctic cat purchase was a topoftheline  f turbo rr which i rode for  miles unfortunately my last snowmobile purchase was a topoftheline  skidoo xrs  why because arctic cat released and has continued to produce a defective machine where  belts last only  miles here i think the math is important the cost per belt mile is x what it should be – and that’s too much yes i have taken it to the dealer but they couldn’t fix what arctic cat failed to properly engineer my dealer is great but it only goes so far yes arctic cat gave me a credit on some belts i won’t get into all of the other numerous issues with the sled but suffice to say it’s a real bad deal for the ordinary consumer fortunately i could afford to take the hit and get out of this sled but many cannot i read one quote from a loyal arctic cat customer that went something like this “that’s a picture of me and my son standing next to my new arctic cat do i look like a bad guy why has arctic cat treated me this way i could barely afford this sled and it is breaking me” indeed my own wife told me it was going to be me or the arctic cat at the end of last winter after spending every weekend i wasn’t riding in the garage fixing the darn thing those stories go on and on so do us arctic cat lovers a favor and spend some time doing root cause analysis of what went wrong at ac such that in my  you are still producing a machine with such poor qualitycustomer experience i am not an engineer but as a lifelong snowmobiler and real world tinkerer i have some ideas on what is wrong my friends and i probably ride one of the hardest duty cycles in the business  mile days in michigan’s up and have even ridden alongside of some of your test engineers so we know how ac tests and it’s not enough howard doran says   pm i was praying we got a ceo with snowmobile experience againcat fumbles the ballthe quality is just not there anymore and it starts at the topi waited  yrs to purchase the procross model because of all the problems holding the  would have all the bugs worked out and the quality of parts would be upgradedwell my new  eltigres driven clutch couldntt be taken apart because of a boat load of overnight holding the screwssent to dealer to be drilled outmy  zr is leaking chain case oil and is going back to dealer tomorrow to find problemneither one has been driven yetarcticget your head out a your adsyoure looseing all your customers brian says   pm ive been in the market for a new atv for a while now i seriously considered models from polaris and can am they look really cool and offer a lot of nice features but engine and frame issues and seeing them broken down on the trails all the time scared me me away from both of those brands i think with any brand you need to start with a solid core machine all the extra fluff just adds to the manufacturing cost per asset i know myself ill add all the flufftires wheels lighting etc myself artic cat needs to focus on the quality of the core machines better frameengine components in order to compete with the other atvs sxs and snowmobiles that are out there another issue is the quality of laborare the workers making them content with their jobs and the way the company is going httpwwwconsumeraffairscomboatsarcticcathtml i posted this link to the consumer affairs page scroll down to the complaint that is rd from the bottom this is an employee with a complaint about the company and its poor quality control in the manufacturing process i really like the look of the new xr line of atvs but im hesitant to put out that kind of money on a possibly inferior machine what are the assurances that if i do take a chance on any arctic cat machine that any defects mechanical or otherwise will be taken care of properly a lot of us out here want to support american brands but the american brands have to support us too robert says   am ended my relationship with cat after  years dealer relations made it impossible to please a customer and allow for a profit at year end not a single call from management asking how can we fix love the brand but couldnt take another year of poor leadership anghelo says   am noihntg i could say would give you undue credit for this story reese says   pm i own a  m snopro and my clutch has failed me at  miles i have to replace clutch at  and i have been told that its a common problem so when it fails i cannot buy parts to rebuild it this is crazy to replace a clutch every  miles this was told to me by the dealer seriously this is what i must do is replace the whole clutch at  a clutch why is parts not available to replace what has failed vs the cost of a new clutch terrible  sent from my iphone chris says   pm i have a  xf  high country limited with  miles on it took it to dealer for winter tune and the primary clutch is shot dealer calling cat monday to see if they will warrantee it i have purchased  new sleds since  and am about to buy a  for the kids if this is not taken care of by the company bye bye to my brand loyalty me and my  primary riding partners were all cat brand loyal we lost one to polaris and if this costs me  i am going to be next how can a primary go on a sled with  miles on it leave a comment
