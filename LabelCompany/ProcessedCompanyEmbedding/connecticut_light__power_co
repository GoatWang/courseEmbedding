company history connecticut light and power company is connecticut’s largest utility the company brings power to  million customers in  cities and towns – covering some  square miles with more than  miles of power lines the company was the creation of j henry roraback a lawyer and powerful republican who dominated connecticut state politics in the early th century in  roraback – described in accounts as a “big forceful mustachioed man” – used his political muscle to lobby the state legislature convincing them to pass a special act that gave him sole power rights to the rocky river a tributary of the housatonic four years later the legislature gave roraback permission to build dams and mills and sell his watergenerated power wholesale throughout the state  the resulting company – then known as the rocky river power company – would eventually supply power to the entire state of connecticut the company changed its name to connecticut light and power company in  and bought three nearby power companies – the start of a long history of acquisitions clp continued to grow and thrive over the next several decades today it is made up of more than  formerly operating companies since  clp has been a subsidiary of northeast utilities a utility holding company consisting of four new england energy companies today northeast utilities is a publicly traded fortune  company that provides power to  million customers it is headquartered in berlin connecticut asbestos exposure risk at connecticut light  power extreme heat is a constant challenge at power plants the nature of the work that boilers generator and turbines perform put them – and workers – at constant risk of fire and heat damage to prevent this power plant equipment prior to the s was frequently made with a naturally occurring mineral found to have powerful fireproofing qualities that naturally occurring mineral was asbestos a substance that until recent decades was widely used in thousands of products as a fireretardant and strengthening agent it was highly effective and because it is found in large mineral deposits in nature it was also cheap and easy to obtain in power plants asbestos was used for multiple purposes to seal gaskets insulate pipes and as a covering on power lines and cables power plants also used asbestos in their roofs and floors to make the buildings themselves resistant to fire even paint and plumbing equipment contained asbestos today we know there are serious health risks associated with asbestos and exposure to the substance can be deadly when insulation or other products containing asbestos deteriorate or when they are torn or cut asbestos fibers are released into the air and if inhaled can become lodged in a person’s lung tissue this can lead to serious respiratory diseases like mesothelioma cancer and asbestosis power plants stopped putting asbestos in their equipment in the s but by then thousands of unsuspecting workers had already been put at risk furthermore while power plants no longer use asbestos in their equipment the substance may still exist in some older buildings and machines therefore it’s important that workers exercise caution and use protective gear in situations when they may come into contact with asbestos fibers occupations at risk for asbestos exposure anyone who worked at a connecticut light and power company power plant – especially prior to the s though some exposure may have occurred more recently – may have been exposed to hazardous asbestos fibers power plant workers sometimes needed to cut and sand gaskets that contained asbestos or cut down pieces of asbestoscontaining insulation these actions released asbestos fibers into the air and – without proper respiratory equipment – those fibers were easily inhaled not only was power plant equipment made with asbestos but the buildings themselves often contained the mineral as well as the floors and ceilings were worked on asbestos dust was often spread throughout the powerhouse putting all workers in the vicinity at risk family members of power plant workers could have been affected by asbestos as well even if they never entered the power plant because asbestos fibers cling to clothing anyone who washed or handled a worker’s dusty work clothes could have inhaled the dangerous fibers it can take decades for symptoms of mesothelioma cancer to begin to appear – sometimes as long as  years this means that sadly survival rates for the disease are very low if you or someone you love may have been exposed to harmful asbestos in the workplace take the time to learn more about the risk factors and treatment of the disease recent news as of february  connecticut light and power company and northeast utilities have been named in numerous lawsuits by individuals who have worked in their facilities plaintiffs in these cases say their health was compromised by breathing hazardous asbestos fibers while working in power plants share tweet

asbestos on the job as a result they are now at risk to develop mesothelioma in this section learn about the history of asbestos use about the products that contained asbestos and about the companies that manufactured them find out which occupations and trades are at higher risk for asbestos exposure learn which job sites across the united states were contaminated with asbestos containing materials and about the risks associated with handling asbestos what is asbestos long considered a miracle material asbestos boasts excellent fire and heat resistant properties this naturallyoccurring mineral now known to be a human carcinogen cancercausing agent has a history that dates back to ancient greece asbestos was used as a building material even as far back as during the roman empire asbestos was a component of fabric that would be used in clothing and a variety of other textiles during the industrial revolution asbestos use grew in factories and other heavy industries throughout the united states asbestos was used not only in factories but also in oil refineries chemical plants on railroad cars and in shipyards asbestos materials were used to insulate pipes and boilers in steam locomotives to line tanks and ovens in refineries and could be found literally everywhere aboard the nation’s ships from engine rooms to galleys as the twentieth century progressed more uses for asbestos were found it was used in the brakes and clutches of automobiles insulated america’s new skyscrapers and was used extensively in the construction industry where it was used in asbestos products like joint compounds cements roofing shingles ceiling and floor tiles siding stucco plaster and much more those workers at risk included any that worked in an asbestosheavy industry or frequently handled asbestos products by the middle of the twentieth century it became apparent that asbestos was causing health problems asbestos exposure is now known to cause mesothelioma this asbestosrelated cancer can occur when asbestos is inhaled and the microscopic fibers become lodged within the outer lung tissue layer known as the mesothelium this thin layer of cells protects and lubricates the chest cavity asbestos causes a sustained inflammation of these cells resulting in harmful scar tissue forming on the surface this scar tissue lays the foundation for cancerous cells to develop despite knowledge of the health risks posed by asbestos historical records indicate that many companies who used asbestos in their facilities knew that the material was dangerous yet continued to allow its use over time as stories of sick employees became commonplace the american government began to consider imposing laws about regulating the use of asbestos asbestos exposure in the united states exposure usually occurred at major construction jobsites in shipyards aboard navy vessels and during construction or renovation of commercial buildings people working in the vicinity of boilers and insulated piping often are at risk in addition teachers students and other staff members who work in older school buildings may be at risk of exposure to asbestos products such as ceiling or floor tiles equally at risk are families of these workers as asbestos often was carried home on clothing asbestos exposure across the united states alabama alaska arizona arkansas california colorado

rhode island south carolina south dakota tennessee texas utah vermont virginia washington washington dc west virginia wisconsin wyoming if you worked at a jobsite where asbestos or asbestos containing products were used you may be at risk to develop mesothelioma different types of asbestos exposure military exposure asbestos was used across all branches of the military for many years navy veterans were exposed to high levels of asbestos while serving on ships aircraft carriers destroyers submarines battleships warships etc in the naval fleet as well as in naval shipyards across the country army veterans were exposed to asbestos in buildings on military installations and while working on military vehicles air force veterans were exposed while working with military aircraft marine corps veterans that spent time at sea aboard navy ships were exposed to asbestos all veterans exposed to asbestos have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma commercial and industrial exposure many workers and maintenance contractors at industrial and commercial job sites were subjected to dangerous levels of asbestos on the job asbestos is a known carcinogen and the primary cause of mesothelioma cancer the types of jobsites where asbestos exposure occurred include oil refineries power plants steel mills and chemical plants to name a few they all have “high heat” environments where the use of fire and heat resistant materials was required be it in the construction of the plants or machinery or in the protective clothing that workers were required to wear in designated areas ie fireproof gloves and aprons today even though the use of asbestos has been banned in the united states many existing industrial and commercial structures may still contain a certain level of asbestos it is important that appropriate safety precautions be taken where necessary to prevent harmful exposure and to mitigate the risk of developing mesothelioma commercial product exposure doityourself home renovation enthusiasts as well as those who worked in the construction trade may have been exposed to asbestos while working with popular building and construction products many of these products were made with asbestos through the late ’s as the projects they were to be used in required that they be heat and fire resistant they included insulation roofing material siding joint compound ceiling tiles flooring and more unfortunately when any of these products were cut sawed filed or sanded asbestos fibers were released into the air in the majority of cases those working with the products did not use appropriate safety precautions because asbestos companies withheld information about the health hazards of asbestos for many years today as a result construction workers and doityourselfers are at risk for developing mesothelioma or other asbestosrelated diseases second hand exposure direct onthejob asbestos exposure did not affect american workers alone their family members were also at risk of developing an asbestosrelated disease as a result of second hand asbestos exposure this type of exposure occurred when workers brought asbestos fibers home on their hair clothing or shoes at the end of the work day those responsible for laundering their work clothes day in and day out were most commonly affected but even small children who spent time with their parent before they had a chance to “clean up” from work were unknowingly placed at risk of developing an asbestosrelated illness talc exposure talc is a naturally occurring silicate mineral most commonly used in cosmetics and toiletries talc mineral on its own is believed to be safe but talc deposits are often found near and among asbestos deposits due to this some talc deposits are contaminated with asbestos fibers causing talc miners to be unknowingly exposed to asbestos while talc miners are at the greatest risk of asbestos exposure some consumer products namely baby powder and more recently children’s art supplies have been found to contain asbestos and cause regular users mostly women to be exposed to asbestos today products using talc are tested for asbestos but that was not always the case because mesothelioma has a long latency period miners and consumers are being diagnosed with mesothelioma decades later from their job and use of the asbestoscontaining talc products unions protect workers from asbestos exposure throughout the united states and across the world hundreds of labor and trade unions are in place to protect individuals who work in myriad industries from steel workers to plumbers to electricians unions have for a long time played a significant role in protecting workers right when it comes to asbestos exposure on the job unions have organized witnesses for court cases have stepped forward to financially aid widows and children of those diagnosed with mesothelioma and have fought against inadequate trust funds proposed by megacompanies to compensate asbestos victims compensation for workers exposed to asbestos if you have developed health problems associated with asbestos exposure you may be entitled to compensation each state has its own

public nuisance law “greenwashing” and the rise of deceptive trade practicefalse advertising class action claims → is electricity a “product” september   admin whether electricity supplied to a homeowner by the local electric utility  is viewed as a “product” or a “service” may have significant ramifications in litigation  if providing electricity constitutes a “product” injured plaintiffs can seek recovery under a theory of strict liability  if it is not a product the plaintiff would have to demonstrate the electric utility failed to use reasonable care  in a recent connecticut case travelers indemnity company of america v connecticut light  power co hartford jd at harford docket no cvs   wl  conn super the trial court  held that once electricity entered the homeowner’s residence it constituted a “product” rather than a “service” and that plaintiff could  proceed under the connecticut product liability act “cpla”   in the case a fire allegedly caused by voltage fluctuations broke out in the home of travelers’ insureds linda and michael murphy resulting in property damage  apparently  the murphy’s had complained to clp earlier about the voltage fluctuations and had been assured that the problem had been addressed  after paying the claim connecticut courts are split concerning whether electricity can be classified as a product such that a claim could be brought under the cpla  however the court in travelers relied upon what appears to be an emerging majority view nationally  in a  california appellate decision pierce v pge the court opined that policy justifications warranted the imposition of strict liability   difficulty of proving negligence involving a vast and complex electrical power system  economic incentive for improved product safety  to encourage reallocation of resources toward safer products and  to spread the risk of loss among all who use the product  what judicial limitations may be reasonable to prevent increased access to strict liability in tort for toxic tort plaintiffs injured by electricity one bright line test might be permit electricity to be viewed as a product only when the electricity has been transferred to the consumer in a usable voltage  only then could a court reasonably view electricity as a consumer product  under this test exposure to high voltage transmission lines would not result in a strict liability lawsuit filed under public utilities strict liability toxic tortproduct liability litigation comments are closed subscribe to this blog by emailstay connected follow us on twitter subscribe

to save a favorite click to dismiss supreme court of connecticut filed april th  precedential status precedential citations  conn  docket number unknown author john p cotter  conn   josephine giglio et al v connecticut light and power company supreme court of connecticut argued november   decision released april   cotter c j loiselle bogdanski peters and wright js  william b fitzgerald jr with whom were john c bullock and on the brief anthony m fitzgerald for the appellant defendant thomas l brayton for the appellee named plaintiff wright j in october of  the defendant connecticut light and power company converted a coal burning home furnace to gas operation for the named plaintiff josephine giglio hereinafter the plaintiff in her apartment in waterbury on october   the plaintiffs daughter feeling cold raised the thermostat regulating the furnace when the furnace did not start she checked the systems baso safety switch an indicator designed to tell whether the pilot light was on or off if the pilot light were on the color silver should have appeared in the window with the word on displayed if the pilot light were off the word  off and the color red should have appeared the indicator on the plaintiffs baso safety switch always showed partially silver and partially red thereby confusing the plaintiff on numerous occasions prior to the incident in question the plaintiff josephine giglio had informed connecticut light and power company employees of the condition of the indicator on those occasions the defendants employees told the plaintiff to check to see if the pilot light was lit in order to check to see if the pilot light was on the plaintiff necessarily had to open the furnace door on this particular occasion the plaintiffs daughter opened the furnace door and observed that the pilot light was on but at the same time the furnace was not running and no heat was being generated the plaintiff josephine giglio then checked the furnace and pilot light herself when she opened the furnace door there was a simultaneous puff or rollout of flames that shot out and severely burned the plaintiff at trial the plaintiffs claim sounded in counts of negligence and strict liability in tort the jury returned an identical verdict for the plaintiff josephine giglio on both counts where there are two or more counts a general verdict will be upheld if any of the counts are valid franks v lockwood  conn    ad  mercier v naugatuck fuel co  conn    ad  bulkley v andrews  conn   similarly where there are two or more distinct causes of action a general verdict will cure an erroneous charge as to one of them barbieri v pandiscio  conn    a   in view of the foregoing we are restricting our discussion to the second count of the substitute complaint relating to strict liability in tort we express no opinion as to the negligence claim the defendant has assigned numerous errors some of these assignments would be pertinent if the judgment on the first count relating to negligence were to be scrutinized by this court since we are restricting our opinion however to the second count relating to strict liability in tort there remain only three main issues to be reviewed i do the evidence and the law support a plaitiffs verdict on the theory of strict tort libility the issue in this case is whether the defendant connecticut light and power companys failure adequately to warn the plaintiff of the possibility of a rollout in the event that the furnace door were opened while the pilot light was on but with the furnace not running constituted an unreasonably dangerous condition thereby rendering the furnace defective we answer this issue in the affirmative under the doctrine of strict liability in tort we find that the jury had sufficient evidence upon which to hold the defendant liable for the damages caused by its defective product in garthwait v burgio  conn   ad  we accepted the principles adopted by the american law institute as contained in § a of the restatement second torts establishing strict liability in tort we have reaffirmed those principles in subsequent cases wachtel v rosol   conn   ad  rossignol v danbury school of aeronautics inc  conn   ad  in order to recover under the doctrine of strict liability in tort the plaintiff must prove that  the defendant was engaged in the business of selling the product  the product was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the consumer or user  the defect caused the injury for which compensation was sought  the defect existed at the time of the sale and  the product was expected to and did reach the consumer without substantial change in condition restatement second torts § a  see rossignol v danbury school of aeronautics inc  conn    ad  the parties did not dispute that the defendant was in the business of selling or leasing gas furnaces nor is it disputed that the gas furnace reached the plaintiff without substantial change in condition the focus of this case then is whether the furnace was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the plaintiff the doctrine of strict liability in tort is concerned with the character of the product injected into the stream of commerce not with the specific conduct of the defendant  dooley modern tort law §   the plaintiff must prove that the product is unreasonably dangerous comment i of the restatement second of torts § a defines an unreasonably dangerous product as one dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics in  this regard it is important to note that it is not necessary that the plaintiff in a strict liability tort action establish a specific defect so long as there is evidence of some unspecified dangerous condition see lindsay v mcdonnell douglas aircraft corporation  fd   th cir   dooley modern tort law op cit §   am jur d products liability §  whether a product is unreasonably dangerous is a question of fact to be determined by the jury as we recently stated this includes those questions arising under § a and the jury can draw their own reasonable conclusions as to the expectations of the ordinary consumer and the knowledge common in the community at large slepski v williams ford inc  conn    ad  it is well established in this jurisdiction tomer v american home products corporation  conn    ad  basko v sterling drug inc  fd  d cir  as well as in a majority of other jurisdictions see generally  dooley modern tort law op cit §  that a product may be defective because a manufacturer or seller failed to warn of the products unreasonably dangerous propensities see restatement second torts § a prokolkin v general motors corporation  conn   ad  noel manufacturers negligence of design or directions for use of a product  yale lj   prosser the fall of the citadel  minn l rev    dean prosser the restatement second reporter states there is no dispute that the seller is under a duty to give adequate warning of unreasonable dangers involved in the use of which  he knows or should know the duty extends not only to dangers arising from improper design or other negligence in manufacturing but also to dangers inseparable from a properly made product of the particular kind prosser law of torts th ed  pp  see basko v sterling drug inc supra  in other words the failure to warn in such circumstances is of itself a defect prosser op cit p  in the case at hand the facts clearly show that the defendant knew or should have known of the potentiality of a dangerous rollout occurring the evidence revealed that the manufacturer anticipated and that the defendant was aware of this dangerous possibility the safety unit contained no warnings the only wording on the unit constituted instructions intended for a service person and for the consumer on how to start the pilot light in the event it went out moreover these instructions were applicable only where the pilot light was out there were no instructions or warning on what to do or what not to do when the pilot light was on but the furnace was not running and no heat was being generated as was the situation in this case in any event the duty to warn involves more than instructions intended for service personnel the warning must consider the consumers comprehension technical language or instructions are insufficient similarly language directed to persons who could not reasonably  be expected to understand the nomenclature is insufficient west v broderick  bascom rope co  nwd  iowa   dooley modern tort law op cit §  warnings must specifically identify for the user the danger inherent in the products use moreover on several occasions the plaintiff notified the defendants employees that the safety unit on the furnace did not clearly indicate whether the pilot light was on the defendants employees instructions to the plaintiff to open the furnace door to see if the pilot light was on in no way resembles a warning as stated above the defendant knew the capabilities of the furnace to accumulate unburned fuel which could result in a dangerous rollout the defendant had a duty adequately to warn the plaintiff of this unreasonably dangerous condition the failure to place an adequate warning on the furnaces safety unit as well as the failure verbally to warn the plaintiff of the possibility of a rollout amount to a defect in the furnace giving rise to an unreasonably dangerous condition upon the evidence presented the jury could properly conclude that the defendant was strictly liable in tort for the injuries resulting therefrom ii did the trial court err in allowing an amenment to add allegations of defects in the product as previously stated the accident occurred on october   original counsel brought suit on september   on august   the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend their substitute complaint to allege that the defendant permitted certain  defects to remain in the furnace system the amendment was allowed by the trial court in this appeal the defendant claims that the trial court erred in allowing such an amendment more than seven years after the accident occurred the defendant makes no claim that the amendment resulted in a delay or surprise the trial took place in december  in the intervening two and onethird years from the date of the amendment the defendant conducted a number of experiments and tests on various parts of the furnace system in view of the fact that the court has broad discretion on the allowing of amendments we must examine the pleadings to determine whether the amendment injected a completely new cause of action an examination of the third count of the original complaint reveals the following paragraphs  said purported safety unit was sold to plaintiff josephine giglio in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to plaintiff josephine giglio and reach sic the plaintiff josephine giglio without substantial change in condition in which it was sold  on or about october   as a result of the continuing tortuous sic conduct of defendant the connecticut light  power company gas in said furnace exploded and shot flames on the plaintiff josephine giglio and caused her the hereinafter stated severe burns and injuries  the tortuous sic conduct of defendant the connecticut light  power company continued from the time of said sale of the purported safety unit until october   because the defendant the connecticut light  power company continually  permitted said purported safety unit to be available for use although they knew or should have known that said purported safety unit was defective and inherently dangerous and a continuing source of unreasonable risk of injury to plaintiff josephine giglio and they failed to indicate and warn plaintiff josephine giglio by label or otherwise of the dangers she was exposed to in gallo v g fox  co  conn    ad  we stated a cause of action is that single group of facts which is claimed to have brought about an unlawful injury to the plaintiff and which entitles the plaintiff to relief bridgeport hydraulic co v pearson  conn    ad  veits v hartford  conn    ad  a right of action at law arises from the existence of a primary right in the plaintiff and an invasion of that right by some delict on the part of the defendant the facts which establish the existence of that right and that delict constitute the cause of action pavelka v st albert society  conn    a  it is proper to amplify or expand what has already been alleged in support of a cause of action provided the identity of the cause of action remains substantially the same as to relation back of amendments we said in keenan v yale new haven hospital  conn    ad  that amendments relate back to the date of the complaint unless they allege a new cause of action this doctrine is akin to rule  c of the federal rules of civil procedure which provides in pertinent part c relation back of amendments  whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct transaction or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading pursuant to this rule the court in hockett v american airlines inc  f sup  nd ill  found that an amendment to add a spouse to allege a claim for loss of consortium related back that court summarized pp  the law as follows rule  c is based upon the concept that a party who is notified of litigation concerning a given transaction or occurrence has been given all the notice that statutes of limitation are intended to afford  moores federal practice para   the objective of state statutes of limitations to protect persons from the necessity of defending stale claims is served under rule  c since the amendment will not relate back unless the original pleading has given fair notice to the adverse party that a claim is being asserted against him from some particular transaction or occurrence wright law of federal courts p  d ed  in reviewing the pertinent law and the allegations of the original complaint we find in the instant case that the court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the amendment specifying defects in the furnace equipment iii is the claim of the plaintiff josephine giglio barred by the appropriate statute of limitations the claim in this case is based on a continuing course of conduct the converting of the furnace  was done on october   but on several occasions after  the plaintiff josephine giglio notified the defendant of difficulties with the furnace and the defendant on those occasions gave the plaintiff various instructions it was for the jury to say whether such instructions were adequate in handler v remington arms co  conn    ad  we said when the wrong sued upon consists of a continuing course of conduct the statute does not begin to run until that course of conduct is completed vilcinskas v sears roebuck  co  conn    ad  in that case the court held that the sale of a defective cartridge without indicating the danger on the label was a continuing omission of a duty to the prospective user of the cartridge as the present suit was pending on june   it comes within the purview of § a of the general statutes which provides that no strict tort liability action for a defective product shall be brought but within three years of the date of injury and not later than eight years from the date of sale lease or bailment of such product  while the record indicates that the furnace was converted to a gas furnace on october   the record also indicates that the offending baso switch was first installed on september   and the solenoid valve was first installed on march   on subsequent dates there were repeated complaints by the plaintiff to the defendant concerning the furnace and repeated instructions and advice given to the plaintiff by the defendant as suit was brought on september   it is clear that the action was commenced within three years of the accident and within eight years of the installation of the alleged defective device we distinguish this case from prokolkin v general motors corporation  conn   ad  which held that liability for a defective product dates from the sale of the product that case was based on §  of the general statutes prior to the enactment of § a there is no error in this opinion the other judges concurred notes  these instructions read  close main and pilot burner gas valves and wait at least five minutes for unburned gas to escape  turn on pilot gas only and ignite pilot gas press release button and hold firmly pressed in for  seconds baso will then remain in operation position and switch will close circuit  general statutes sec a limitation of action based on strict tort liability for products in defective condition a no action to recover damages for injury to the person or to real or personal property caused by any product in a defective condition shall be brought against one who manufactures sells leases or bails any such product but within three years from the date when the injury is first sustained discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered except that no such action may be brought later than eight years from the date of sale lease or bailment of such product b in any such action the seller lessor or bailor may implead any third party who is or may be liable to him for all or part of the plaintiffs claim if such third party defendant is served with the third party complaint within one year from the date the cause of action brought under subsection a of this section is returned to court c the provisions of this section shall apply to all actions pending on or brought after june   claiming strict liability regardless of the date of the act or omission complained of section a has been amended by public acts  no  to provide that the now ten year limitation within which products liability claims must be brought does not apply to

lumens related information color temperature comparison clearance led household bulbs how to light a room the specs that matter in order to set the tone of a room and achieve the look you want its important to be aware of what a lights specifications say about its output learning how to light a room with led lights depends on more than brightness and lumens do you want to create a relaxed environment one thats lively and bright or one thats romantic any look is possible with the right led lights theyre available in a variety of intensities color temperatures shades and with different beam angles dimming capabilities and colorrendering indexes cri lumens lumens are a measurement of the amount of light produced by a source the higher the lumen count the brighter the light source lumens are often the deciding factor when it comes to purchasing new led light bulbs or fixtures theyre a more reliable metric to use than choosing a light based on its wattage an led light with an output thats comparable to a watt incandescent bulb might only consume  watts of power kitchens bathrooms laundry rooms and closets are areas where high lumen counts would be beneficial but brightness as with any other lighting choice is entirely up to you and the look you want for your room led bulbs are available in many intensities but those intensities often depend on the lights color temperature—otherwise known as the shade of white light being emitted correlated color temperature cct cct indicates the hue and tone of white light emitted from a specific bulb or fixture its measured in kelvins k which is similar to degrees in celsius different temperatures on the kelvin scale represent different colors for example light at kk looks more orangeyellow and is called ultra warm or warm white and as temperature increases in kelvins color changes to more of a “paper white” known as natural or neutral white between k and k and finally into a bluishwhite known as cool white k as a light sources color temperature increases brightness often increases while shopping for led lights pay close attention to the color temperatures that are available for any one bulb or fixture choosing a warm white bulb with a color temperature around k might mean sacrificing some brightness whereas if you choose the natural white version its likely that it will have a higher output traditionally different rooms are associated with different tones for example living rooms and nurseries tend to have soft warm white light a warm white light source will highlight other warm colors in a room is least likely to show imperfections and appears less bright when compared to higher ccts in kitchens basements garages and other areas where tasks are completed its standard to have natural or even cool white bulbs or fixtures because of the crisp bright white light that they emit colorrendering index cri cri indicates how accurately a light source reveals the true colors of objects people clothing etc when compared to how colors are shown in incandescent light or daylight the closer a light’s cri is to  the cri of incandescent light or daylight the better the color rendition of objects under that light any room can benefit from highcri led lights theyre great for living room lighting as they will show paint and furniture colors accurately kitchens closets bathrooms dressing rooms and other areas where presentation appearance and depth of color are important can also benefit from highcri led lights accurate color rendering can be achieved with a highcri light strip can light globe bulb linear light or other highcri bulb or fixture lights with a cri of  or higher are considered to show colors most accurately the cri of an led light generally ranges from  to  nanometers in order to understand nanometers you must first understand the electromagnetic spectrum and wavelengths the electromagnetic spectrum is the entire range of invisible and visible light and a wavelength is the distance between peaks of light waves wavelengths are measured in nanometers which are simply units of length that indicate colors of light within the spectrum nanometers will tell you how red green yellow purple etc a light source really is these measurements start lower at ultraviolet and increase from green to blue yellow orange and then red the wavelength of a colored light can be found in the lights specifications table beam angle fixtures or bulbs that emit wide beams such as led panel lights or br led bulbs for can lights are great for areas that require a lot of light such as basements kitchens or living rooms narrow beam angles like those from can lights with led par bulbs or track lights with mr led bulbs are best for highlighting decor or small areas globe bulbs such as a or g led vanity bulbs have degree beam angles which means that they throw light in all directions globe bulbs are the perfect choice for centralized light fixtures beam angle or pattern is a measurement of the angles that are formed between a cone of light’s brightest point the center and the points on both sides of the center where the light’s intensity is  percent as bright a larger beam angle means a wider spread of light across an area and vice versa with small beam angles while it depends on the angle and individual retailers small beam patterns are often referred to as spot beams and larger angles usually anything above  degrees are considered flood beams dimmability dimmable led bulbs and fixtures allow you to adjust the lighting in any room to match its function during a particular time for example in a living room or theater room you might want low light for watching tv but high light output for a gathering of friends theyre also great for bathrooms where you need bright light to get ready but want dim lighting for relaxing in a bathtub dimmable chandelier bulbs for example can create the perfect atmosphere for a family dinner while also allowing enough light for the room to function as a work space for school projects when dimmed these led lights also reduce energy consumption theyre available in a wide variety of shapes sizes
