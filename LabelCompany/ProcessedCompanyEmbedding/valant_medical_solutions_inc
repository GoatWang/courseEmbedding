it became clear to me my documentation was not adequate and that i was putting myself at risk it became time to look at an integrated system… it is clear it valant was designed for a psychiatrist and support is great i’m not a big computer geek this system is perfect for people not so comfortable going to valant didn’t require a huge learning curve”  andrew compaine md “in documenting psychiatric cases valant has multiple options for my note taking and record keeping specific to psychiatry that help keep it organized and focused in what i’m interested in and what i need to do oh and my billers love valant it’s quick to learn quick for them to reconcile payments and i get paid quickly tax time is coming i can look up how i collected in cash so i can add that to my income it’s very easy for me to do the reporting myself with very few clicks just by looking at the system there is nothing i had to learn or study”  philip malinas md “before i had three different systems one for scheduling one for ehr one for billing and we were always having to update people in multiple systems and it was just terrible this is an integrated system it works really smoothly the todo list keeps me organized it’s very easy to see where billing is it’s very easy to see when medication refills need to happen i couldn’t be more pleased the system is so intuitive once we got the patient data loaded we’ve had no problem since it was easy simple and the support i get from the folks at the valant office is superb”  john fleming md   we think youll love the valant prescribers suite request a demo
