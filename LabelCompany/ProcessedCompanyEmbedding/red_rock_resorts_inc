and hotels in the las vegas area including to some degree from each other we compete with other nonrestricted casinohotels as well as restricted gaming locations by focusing on repeat customers and attracting these customers through innovative marketing programs our valueoriented highquality approach is designed to generate repeat business additionally our casino properties are strategically located and designed to permit convenient access and ample parking which are critical factors in attracting local visitors and repeat patrons currently there are approximately  major gaming properties located on or near the las vegas strip  located in the downtown area and several located in other areas of las vegas we also face competition from  nonrestricted gaming locations in the clark county area primarily targeted to the local and repeat visitor markets in addition our casino properties face competition from restricted gaming locations sites with  or fewer slot machines in the greater las vegas area as of december   there were approximately  restricted gaming locations in the las vegas area with approximately  slot machines major additions expansions or enhancements of existing properties or the construction of new properties by competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business the nevada legislature enacted sb  in  this legislation identified certain gaming enterprise districts wherein casino gaming development would be permitted throughout the las vegas valley and established more restrictive criteria for the establishment of new gaming enterprise districts we believe the growth in gaming supply in the las vegas locals market has been and will continue to be limited by the provisions of sb  to a lesser extent we compete with gaming operations in other parts of the state of nevada such as reno laughlin and lake tahoe and other gaming markets throughout the united states and in other parts of the world and with state sponsored lotteries onandofftrack wagering on horse and other races card rooms online gaming and other forms of legalized gambling the gaming industry also includes landbased casinos dockside casinos riverboat casinos racetracks with slots and casinos located on native american land there is intense competition among companies in the gaming industry some of which have significantly greater resources than we do several states are currently considering legalizing casino gaming in designated areas legalized casino gaming in such states and on native american land could result in additional competition and could adversely affect our operations particularly to the extent that such gaming is conducted in areas close to our operations we also face competition from internet poker operators in nevada in addition legislation approving internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states expansion of internet gaming and legalized casino gaming in new or existing jurisdictions and on native american land could result in additional competition for our nevada operations and for the gaming facilities that we manage for native american tribes native american gaming in california as it currently exists has had little if any impact on our nevada operations to date although there are no assurances as to the future impact it may have in total the state of california has signed and ratified tribalstate compacts with  native american tribes currently there are  native american gaming facilities in operation in the state of california these native american tribes are allowed to operate slot machines lottery games and banked and percentage games including  on native american lands a banked game is one in which players compete against the licensed gaming establishment rather than against one another a percentage game is one in which the house does not directly participate in the game but collects a percentage of the amount of bets made winnings collected or the amount of money changing hands it is not certain whether any expansion of native american gaming in california will affect our nevada operations given that visitors from california make up nevadas largest visitor market increased competition from native american gaming in california may result in a decline in our revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business company description we are a leading gaming development and management company operating  strategicallylocated casino and entertainment properties we have developed over  billion of regional gaming and entertainment destinations in multiple jurisdictions in addition we are an established leader in native american gaming managing facilities in northern california and western michigan we began operations in  with a  square foot casino featuring  slot machines and have grown through development and acquisitions to become a premier provider of gaming and entertainment for residents of the las

machines  table games and  hotel rooms our las vegas properties are broadly distributed throughout the market and easily accessible with over  of the las vegas population located within five miles of one of our gaming facilities we offer convenience and a wide variety of gaming and nongaming entertainment options to attract guests to our properties we also provide friendly service and exceptional value in a comfortable environment most of our major properties are masterplanned for expansion enabling us to incrementally expand our facilities as demand dictates we also control seven highly desirable gamingentitled development sites consisting of approximately  acres in las vegas and reno nevada we believe that the las vegas regional market is one of the most attractive gaming markets in the united states due to favorable economic and market fundamentals a number of which drive demand for our products the following metrics for the most recent period available indicate that an economic recovery is underway in the las vegas regional market • population growth was approximately  times the national average in  • las vegas yearoveryear employment growth was  based on december  data from the us bureau of labor statistics bls which marks the fifth consecutive year of positive growth • home value appreciation of  compared to the national average of  during the year ended december   • las vegas welcomed a record  million visitors for the year ended december   and • approximately  billion in new investments are either in the planning stages or actively under development in las vegas based on public announcements in addition to these favorable demand drivers the las vegas regional market provides a stable and highly attractive tax structure as well as legal limitations that restrict the development of additional offstrip gaming properties in particular • nevada offers the lowest maximum statutory gaming tax rate in the united states at  and has only raised gaming taxes once in the last  years • nevada state senate bill  sb  enacted in  significantly limits the construction of casinos in the las vegas valley and • no new major gaming facilities have opened in the las vegas regional market that cater predominantly to las vegas residents since  and no new development of such facilities has been announced we are intensely focused on providing the best possible guest
