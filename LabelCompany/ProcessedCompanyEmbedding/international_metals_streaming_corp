includes fnv rgld sand wpmby lawrence elawrence e long only gold  precious metals contrariansummaryanalysts have gravely understated the value of the royalty and streaming companies by not understanding terminal value and by ignoring the rising price of golda thorough analysis of competition risk and management of precious metals royalty and streamingmining companies are capitalintensive commodity businesses and therefore are horrible investments precious metals royalty and streaming are nearly riskfree and have enormous upside potentialthe mafia of the gold mining industry the dominant players in the industry include silver wheaton franco nevada royal gold sandstorm gold a brief explanation of the business the precious metals royaltystreaming company issues common shares and the small management team receives cash they receive many phone callsoffers they dont have to proactively make outgoing offers they look at  prospects a year and choose to do two or three deals criteria for the streams include great asset with exploration upside low cost quartile and great management team the royaltystreaming company provides cash to an operator in exchange for a streaming contract imposed on the asset the contract stipulates that the operator must pay the royaltystreaming company a certain portion of the precious metal ounces produced over the life of the mine the streaming company has fixed ongoing costs however the company is still exposed to cost pressures and other risks of the underlying operator because the royaltystream payments are dependent on production levels royaltystreaming companies provide three opportunities exposure to the commodity ie precious metals the interest rate and productionexploration upside can provide a return even if the precious metal is shorted as a hedge value arbitrage silver is often a byproduct not the core asset lead zinc nickel copper or other base metal mines generally do not want exposure to silver and trade at lower pes than pure silver companies the silver stream trades at a higher pe when extracted from the base metal mine and hence instantaneous value is created the fundamental reason pure goldsilver companies trade at higher pe ratios is that the riskfree rate used can be close to zero considering that many investors hold physical goldsilver with no yield financing the various phases of mining first a company must find a deposit through exploration once a discovery is made the property must be developed feasibility permitting and mine construction then finally production occurs the royaltystreaming companies can provide financing along every phase namely exploration mine construction and streams can be purchased on producing mines exploration stage the royaltystreaming companies can spend small amounts of money on exploration ventures with the opportunity for enormous returns this method allows the royaltystreaming companies to take advantage of their very longterm perspective bank debt is not a viable option because it is shortterm in nature bonds are not particularly suitable because ongoing interest payments are impractical for junior companies with no earnings most junior exploration companies are funded by equity equity investors must have a diversified portfolio of junior explorers and always face the risk of bankruptcy or dilution a company may run out of cash before making a major discovery and be forced to shut down or dilute existing shareholders streamingroyalty companies can provide diversification and because the royaltystream is on the land bankruptcy risk is nonexistent the project will be completed sooner or later if it is a quality asset funding for mine construction this allows the royaltystreaming company to bypass the many years of cumbersome exploration and permitting after all the regulatory headaches are taken care of the royaltystreaming company steps in to provide funding and receives the gold shortly after value arbitrage from producing mines this method allows for instant value creation large commodity producers are not interested in their precious metal byproducts by separating the base metal from the precious metal each part is able to trade at a higher valuation than the sum outstanding performance under worstcase scenario  and  were years of rapidly rising costs for miners and crashing precious metal and other commodity prices despite this the royaltystreaming companies are trading at near alltime highs while many regular miners are trading near alltime lows the royaltystreaming companies have increased their dividends while many operators have reduced or halted dividend payments since their creation the royaltystreaming companies have outperformed nearly every precious metals mining company when comparing past performance one must keep survivorship bias in mind the price performance of many mining companies has been flat or down over the decade during the same period presumably a weak mining environment the royaltystreaming companies have had outstanding performance the royaltystreaming companies have proven that they are able to outperform the goldsilver etfs their premium relative to the price of goldsilver etfs has expanded over time the stock prices of royaltystreaming companies have gone up despite leveraged exposure to precious metal prices in a declining market and heavy exposure to mining conditions in a rising cost environment streams the only difference between a royalty and a stream is that the latter includes fixed ongoing payments for each ounce of precious metal purchased the streams fixed ongoing payments are usually as low as  per ounce of gold and  per ounce of silver when most investors learn about these low cash costs they typically think that the mining companies try to bargain the fixed ongoing payment upwards … but actually its the opposite when the mining companies look at a spreadsheet they quickly realize that they can receive more money to build their mine the upfront payment if they reduce the ongoing payments the streaming companies have been able to force up the fixed ongoing payments which illustrates their strong bargaining power fixed costs and indirect cost exposure royaltystreaming companies have fixed costs and are therefore not directly affected by cost increases however because costs affect the miners adversely the royaltystreaming companies are indirectly negatively impacted by rising costs royaltystream payments are made from the operators revenue and are thus not directly impacted by rising costs for the operator falling costs allow for margin expansion and rising costs force margins to shrink in contrast changes in costs do not affect the profit margins of the royaltystreaming companies this is a clear advantage for the royaltystreaming companies because inflationary pressures are relentless mining is a laborintensive industry and labor costs have a tendency to rise persistently especially due to union pressures if costs rise for the operator then production is likely to decline and rampupsexploration upside become restricted this greatly reduces the value of the royaltystream even when margins are unaffected in the event that there is an issue with the mine the royaltystreaming company suffers a delay in production whereas the operator must continue paying employees suffer equipment maintenance costs pay the cost of fixing the issue if necessary dilute shareholders at precisely the wrong time rising costs may create cash flow problems for the operator increasing bankruptcy risk but on the other hand it also creates an opportunity for the royaltystreaming companies to provide more financing mine shutdown the main risk for the royaltystreaming companies is the possibility that the mine shuts down there is no recourse for the royaltystreaming company of course if the mine restarts production regardless of how long it takes the royaltystreaming company remains entitled to receive payment to avoid this problem the management invests only in highquality assets mines that are in low cost quartiles are unlikely to stop producing irrespective of low commodity prices once a mine shuts down it is very difficult to start it up again the company would rather continue to operate unprofitably than shut down for various reasons the management loses their salaries the operator may lose its permits the equipment rusts without costly ongoing maintenance employees that are laid off must be rehired the price of gold and rigidminded analysts when calculating the value of royaltiesstreams analysts erroneously use flat goldsilver prices and then they use ridiculously low discount rates to justify the seemingly high valuation analysts are right to use a low risk premium because of the extremely low risk involved with the royaltystreaming model but the discount rate typically used is clearly reverseengineered to justify the market valuation it only makes sense to use flat gold prices for regular mining companies whose costs rise with inflation using flat gold prices and flat costs is equivalent to making equal inflation adjustments for both prices and costs which leaves the margins constant over time gold prices must rise faster than mining costs otherwise gold mining companies cannot capture any benefit from inflation in contrast the royaltystreaming companies have fixed costs and hence the value of royalties mimics the gold price if an adjustment is made to include rising precious metal prices ie a  average compounded annual increase then the value of the stream increases dramatically over time gold prices will naturally rise at a rate equal to money supply growth because the supply of gold is virtually fixed one can easily calculate a conservative compounded annual growth rate of roughly  current price of gold   price of goldr discount rate inflation the supply of precious metal is virtually fixed unlike the supply of consumer goods which grows over time if average annual money supply growth is  then the price of precious metals virtually fixed in supply will rise at  per year on average over time if average annual money supply growth is  and the supply of consumer goods increases at an average rate of  per year then consumer price inflation will be  annually the royaltystreaming companies have continuous annual revenue growth of  and they can discount inflation at  given these figures holding precious metals provides a  real yield per annum risk premium the business model is very lowrisk as long as the asset is highquality and commodity prices are at reasonable levels then the only risk is a delay in production thus the risk premium can be low discount rate infinitely valuable the price of royaltystreaming companies could arguably be infinite if they have the ability to endlessly provide any degree of alpha to the price of gold or silver many individuals hold goldsilver with zero yield negative yield if storage costs are taken into consideration suggesting that the discount rate on precious metals should be zero if royaltystreaming companies can receive any positive yield on their precious metaldenominated loans then these returns can be discounted at a discount rate of zero assuming the funds can be continually reinvested forever into the future an infinite stream of earnings can be summed to arrive at the price of royaltystreaming companies on the other hand from the perspective of income return or per share earnings the performance of streamingroyalty companies may not necessarily be that good royalty vs stream the only difference between a stream and a royalty is that a stream includes fixed ongoing payments for each ounce of precious metal purchased streams have a powerful advantage over royalties inflation can only reduce future dollardenominated liabilities the upfront fixed payment cannot be affected no matter how much inflation is created afterwards the streams ongoing fixed per ounce payments can be wiped out through inflation another advantage of a stream compared to a royalty is that there is less disincentive to mine because the streaming company pays part of the cost the royaltystream company must ensure it does not take too much of the profits of the miner there is no liquidity risk with a royalty or a stream the streams ongoing payments never pose a liquidity problem because the ongoing payments always coincide with the royaltystream precious metal payments the fixed ongoing per ounce cost is just a technicality if ever the price of goldsilver goes below the fixed ongoing per ounce cost the contract stipulates that in that case the market price is paid streams benefit from inflation through margin expansion if a royalty company provides ten million dollars in exchange for  ounces of gold at ounce one year later then regardless of the level of money printing the real return on the inflationhedged investment is  an inflation hedge is neutral in the sense that it defends you against inflation but it does not allow you to benefit from inflation the beauty of a stream compared to a royalty is that fixed currencydenominated payments are made in the future example a streaming company gives ten million dollars in exchange for  ounces of gold ounce plus an ongoing payment of ounce at the end of one year analysts would get a cash margin of  in both cases the previous royalty example however if there is hyperinflation the  ongoing payment would effectively disappear leaving the company with a  cash margin the stream unlike a royalty allows the holder to benefit from inflation by having the ongoing cash payment slowly decrease in real terms the gold price will rise based solely on an increase in the supply of money thereby increasing stream revenue proportionately while the ongoing payments remain the same the benefit can be calculated by factoring in a rising gold price  into the spreadsheet management the royaltystreaming companies have very few employees the majority of which are managers silver wheaton has about  employees franconevada has about  and royal gold has about  employees sandstorm gold and sandstorm metals  energy have a combined  employees given that there are only a handful of employees rising administrative costs will not harm the business and any slack can be identified and removed promptly management has a lot of control over the business management can be patient and not engage in deals if precious metal prices are too high or if it is not satisfied with the return additionally the company can buy royalties to acquire a right of first refusal engage in share repurchases return cash to shareholders through a dividend acquire existing royaltystreaming companies go for a business that any idiot can run  because sooner or later any idiot is probably going to run it  peter lynch the managements of all four dominant players have already done a wonderful job at acquiring a valuable portfolio of royalties and streams they are now useless any additional deals are likely to be less profitable than the ones that management has already made based on diminishing marginal returns ie management will pick the lowhanging fruit first only accretive deals ie deals with higher rates of return than the existing average will make the company more valuable on a per share basis royaltystreaming companies do not necessarily need management if the cost of management is one percent of market capitalization or say ten percent of earnings per year then the market cap should rise by ten percent assuming the earnings are discounted at  the day the management is fired of course if management is fired then terminal value will vanish a potential problem management benefits through an increase in compensation from having a very large company the management could be tempted to issue common shares to engage in nonaccretive deals which would dilute shareholders the managers can make it seem like they are finding projects with high rates of return by choosing deals with greater risks the managements of the dominant companies have been very shareholderfriendly and there is no evidence to suggest that this will change silver wheaton did not engage in a deal for roughly  years  during a period of very high spot silver prices silver wheatons vale deal is an example of shareholderfriendly behavior and longterm thinking many analysts were disappointed with the salobo deal because of a supposedly low irr not recognizing its riskfree nature and high potential for production upside terminal value simply discounting the existing royaltystream payments to the present does not provide a full representation of the royaltystreaming companys value once the royaltiesstreams mature the funds can be reinvested if management can make new loans at a rate superior to that of a riskfree sovereign bond then this alpha must be discounted to the present and added to the value of the company for example assume the management can reinvest the proceeds from any royaltiesstreams that mature at a riskfree rate of  this number is conservative considering it includes the lending rate the rising price of gold and explorationproduction upside if a longterm government bond is trading at  then the alpha produced by management is  per year forever into the future the  if discounted at the longterm government bond rate is worth  at the maturity date of the original royaltiesstreams this  needs to be further discounted to the present at the riskfree rate if on average the royaltiesstreams mature in  years then the present value of the  outperformance is worth   if management cannot continuously reinvest the companys funds at superior returns then their existence is not justified and they should immediately be fired management can also justify its existence by finding accretive deals but this is limited competition worstcase scenario royaltystreaming companies are essentially financing companies and thus they compete with other royaltystreaming companies debt including bank debt and equity the worstcase scenario for the royaltystreaming companies with respect to competition is that they halt operations and fire management the companies can simply stop doing deals hold their existing portfolios and return excess cash to investors of course this will wipe out terminal value but this is somewhat offset by eliminating management fortunately the worstcase scenario is an unlikely outcome competition royaltystreaming companies the companies that have chosen to avoid the actual mining of gold have prospered prospect generators virginia mines reservoir minerals abitibi royalties solitario exploration  royalty the prospect generators represent potential competitors that may begin to compete small competitors altius minerals callinan royalties anglo pacific group the business model of the royaltystreaming companies is to consider and analyze various mines determine which are the most lucrative and then pay an appropriate price for the royaltystream acquiring royaltiesstreams is essentially identical to acquiring companies especially other royalty companies the dominant players have the ability to examine the existing royaltystreaming companies and acquire the best ones eg international royalty corporation premier royalties gold wheaton etc industry consolidation reduces competition and reinforces the niches of each of the major players competition niches silver wheaton dominates the silver streaming space the other players are reluctant to compete for silver deals too fiercely sandstorm has explicitly stated that it will not compete with gold wheaton when glw still existed as a separate entity or silver wheaton silver wheaton for the most part stays within its niche by engaging in very large silver streams not royalties royal gold and franconevada purchase many royalties on exploration projects franconevadas assets consist of roughly  oil  gas due to sandstorms small size it will surely encounter less competition only large deals move the needle for the larger players and therefore management cannot get bogged down by the small deals that sandstorm is interested in additionally royaltystreaming companies serve as a second set of eyes and reinforce the legitimacy and quality of the project small companies benefit disproportionately from this because the market sees that the royaltystreaming company checks off on the quality of the asset unlike debt stream financing is patient capital there are no covenants that the miner can trip over royaltystreaming companies are partners of the mining companies their interests are aligned sandstorms management is interested in ultimately being a onestop financing entity for mining companies based on the specific mine sandstorm can determine how the capital structure comprised of equity debt and stream financing should be formed this allows royaltystreaming companies to build a brand and to build relationships with the mining companies further strengthening their market position niches various phases of mining various phases of mining include exploration mine construction and production royaltiesstreams can be purchased in each category analyzing the value of royaltiesstreams requires a different skill set for every different mining phase this creates an opportunity for the royaltystreaming companies to build a niche niches buying royalties on exploration projects this requires being able to figure out whether an asset is viable whether a major discovery will be made andor whether a mine will be built and in how much time funding for mine construction it is necessary to analyze the specific operator unlike the exploration method where quality of the asset is the only consideration the operator must be strong financially the operators management must be highly experienced explorationproduction upside is relevant but ensuring that the mine is built without encountering too many technical and legal problems is paramount given that large producers have access to equity and debt markets this category involves dealing with small mining companies value arbitrage this method involves transactions with large producers generally financially sound and highly experienced assessing productionexploration upside and determining if the costs are sufficiently low is essential competition industry as the industry expands from its current state of infancy there may be a lot of room for growth and room for new streaming companies for many years the combined market capitalization of the dominant players is less than  billion additionally many competitors may focus their efforts away from the precious metals space on the much undeveloped base metal and energy royaltystreaming industry eg altius minerals sandstorm metals  energy the commodity royaltystreaming industry can easily be  of the global mining industry roughly  trillion which suggests an industry size of at least  billion competition barriers to entry barriers to entry are surprisingly high nolan watson an expert in the field considering his experience at slw and a workaholic had a difficult time starting up sandstorm potential investors were reluctant to invest the model seemed too good to be true and they felt they had to be missing something the royaltystreaming companies consider hundreds of deals and only do a few per year the capability of management is crucial but it is difficult to prove their skill and establish credibility without a longterm track record the outcome of exploration projects is not known for years even decades many companies that try to enter the space run out of cash they do not get into cash flowing positions and so they end up being bought out or merged the stream contracts must ensure that the tax structure accounting structure and legal framework are all properly aligned some startup streaming companies have had trouble doing this david harquail claims that the hit rate for true value creation events such as goldstrike detour tasiast and other major discoveries that fnv holds a royalties on is  in  a new royalty company will not be sufficiently diversified to ensure great returns the deals are very large and becoming larger and thus large amounts of capital are required to create a diversified royaltystreaming company competition debt debt finance and the mining companies incentives are not aligned banks are heavily regulated and hence inefficient they are not legally allowed to engage in royaltystream finance it is notoriously difficult for junior mining companies putting their first or second asset into production to acquire bank finance it may take three to six months or longer to acquire the funds in contrast royalties and streams can be arranged extremely quickly the due diligence that is done on the mining companies is costly and even then there is no commitment from the banks that they will lend even if the bank does lend there are extremely onerous covenants banks may force miners to hedge their production as a condition for a loan the covenants often force the company to raise equity diluting shareholders if the tight covenants are breached and the bank gets nervous it can seize assets or demand that more collateral is put up for the loan bonds bring risk of default interest payments can be difficult to make during turbulent times additionally unexpected production delays can make principal repayment difficult even when the company is fundamentally solvent the companies cant roll over their debt or issue equity at precisely the wrong time when there are low gold prices and high costs nearly every mine has unforeseen challenges that create shortterm liquidity problems and make it easy to trip over debt covenants bondholders and banks are not as patient as royaltystreaming companies and serve as a source of stress for mining companies competition equity the main competition for royaltystreaming companies is the equity market equity shares in the upside and the downside potential of a project and is just as patient as royaltystream capital ideally the royaltystreams can be used to complement equity this way the royaltystreams can receive large returns and have the equity holders bear the risk the ability to do royaltystream deals is somewhat countercyclical during a mining and precious metal bull market there is plenty of financing available through equity this restricts the royaltystreaming companys ability to do deals regardless the companies will perform well because precious metal prices and mining conditions will presumably be favorable note that this is a natural constraint on the managements ability to complete large deals at the height of the market during a mining and precious metal bear market financing will dry up and opportunities will be available for the royaltystreaming companies streams are more dilutive than equity the typical argument is that if the share price is below nav book value then equity dilution will be especially burdensome it is a fallacy to believe that streams are less dilutive than equity mining company share prices are low when mining conditions are weak which suggests that in such an environment the terms of a stream will be favorable to the royaltystreaming company and thus highly dilutive to shareholders royaltystreams receive all the upside if the mining company does well and have less downside if the company performs poorly if stream finance is used and the company has positive earnings then the stream will receive payment thereby diluting shareholders and the company has negative earnings but does have revenue then the stream will receive payment thereby diluting shareholders if equity finance is used and the company has positive earnings then new equity will dilute shareholders and the company has negative earnings then the new equity will help to dilute the losses for the previous shareholders if the mine shuts down or bankruptcy occurs then the shareholders likely get wiped out and streamholders will either be treated like subordinated debt holders or simply have to wait for another operator to come along shareholder vs streamholder too good to be true the business model seems to not make any sense why would the royaltystreaming companies issue equity and then transfer the money to mining companies why wouldnt the mining companies just issue equity is there a fundamentaleconomic reason for the existence of royalties and streams the royaltystream has the unique capability of being placed or concentrated on one specific mine compared to equity which applies to the entire companys earnings why would an operator choose a royaltystream instead of equity one reason previously mentioned is value arbitrage the mining company can kill two birds with one stone raise funds and divest itself of a noncore asset this method allows the mining company to raise funds by concentrating its sale on one specific part the stream of the mine if an equity investor wants to invest in a specific mine of a mining company that owns many mines he cannot do so without taking on the rest of the companys assets by allowing investors to invest in the mines of which they are most optimistic the cost of capital is reduced additionally if the value of one specific mine has not declined as much as other lowerquality assets all held by the same mining company then the mining company can benefit by issuing a royaltystream on the asset that is not selling at a distressed price there may be financial risk such as a high debt load the underlying asset might be great but prospective shareholders might be reluctant to invest because of bankruptcy risk even if the expected return for shareholders is high the volatility of earnings can make bankruptcy a possibility attempting to roll over the debt and take on more debt can be very difficult under distressed conditions streams are like debt in that they are less exposed in the case of bankruptcy but are patient like equity when a royaltystream is imposed on the land it reduces the value of the land if the mining company sells the land after applying a royaltystream it will receive less this reduces the cushion for bondholders bond covenants can be circumvented assuming there are no provisions about royaltiesstreams bondholders are effectively being robbed to benefit the shareholders and the streamroyalty holder high lending rates sandstorm generally prices its deals using a  discount rate conservative commodity prices and then considers whether there is enough production and exploration upside potential as evidenced by many deals sandstorm applies an annual  charge in a formulaic manner to repurchase agreements that are offered most stream deals do not include a repurchase option and typically only up to  of the stream can be bought back by the mining company the mining company would not have negotiated for the buyback option were it not favorable suggesting that the  annual rate of return is the minimum that sandstorm is expecting the use of a systematic approach suggests that the performance can be repeated and does not rely solely on managements ability a business with littletono debt yet a high capacity for debt royaltystreaming companies have the capacity to hold a large amount of debt for several reasons a very liquid business the royaltystreaming companies often hold large cash stocks they are constantly issuing equity and free cash flow is continuously generated from the royaltiesstreams stable earnings unlike some operators a royaltystreaming company is diversified across many different mines in different geopolitical environments royaltystreaming companies have a lower risk profile because they are not directly affected by cost increases and additionally they are not fully exposed to technical problems with the mine continuously growing earnings a high debt load can be sustained as long as the company keeps growing ie as long as there is continuously more cash inflow than outflow the royaltystreaming business model requires that royaltiesstreams are continuously purchased therefore an increasing amount of cash continuously flows into the business while any increase in debt lags behind the debt relative to equity declines as the company grows on an absolute and per share basis however as long as the company expects to grow in the future it can maintain its high debttoequity ratio on an ongoing basis with very little risk the precious metals streamroyalty industry is still in its infancy and has a lot more growth ahead of it the lowrisk financial leverage can magnify performance royaltiesstreams yield higher rates than debt there are several reasons for this royaltiesstreams are unsecured debt is secured and therefore should naturally provide higher return royaltiesstreams have principal payments embedded in the return debt is not inflationhedged like precious metals royaltiesstreams the ability to borrow at low rates and lend at higher rates allows virtually an unlimited amount of debt to be sustainable potential to become a ponzi scheme no one ever really knows whether a dividend is real ie whether it is justified by earnings or whether equity is being distributed back to shareholders consider a scenario where the royaltystreaming companies started paying a  dividend yield the dividend would be received by the existing shareholders at the expense of the newer shareholders new shares are continuously being issued for new royalties and streams and therefore there are always newer shareholders arriving to fund the previous shareholders the royaltiesstreams often last decades and therefore there is no way to know whether they are profitable or not for a long time the only thing that would put a stop to this virtuous cycle is if investors stopped believing that the real return on investment is  and realized that it was all just a ponzi scheme of course any company can do this but because royaltystreaming companies constantly issue shares it would be far more difficult to identify risk mitigation through a base metal put the beauty of the royaltystreaming model is that it is insulated from nearly every risk however there is one important risk that must be considered often the royaltiesstreams are placed on base metal mines if base metal prices were to collapse many of the base metal mines would become uneconomic and thus byproduct precious metal production would correspondingly decrease additionally base metal credits are used to offset cash costs of precious metal mining therefore if base metal prices fall cash costs will rise for precious metal mines resulting in lower production and lower royaltystream proceeds fortunately this risk can be hedged out using a base metal eg copper way outofthemoney put when to buy if the spread between the price of silver wheaton is high on a historical basis relative to the price of physical silver then it may be best to wait for the premium to diminish or even better turn

called the “junk business” back in earlier simpler times when environmental protection was not a concern and “junk metal” was simply hammered or melted into something else if it wasn’t just dumped and forgotten today we know very well the harmful effects of improperly disposed of waste metal science and technology has not only enlightened us as to the dangers of improper disposal it has also shown us how to more effectively and efficiently recycle scrap metal turning it from waste into a valuable commodity to be used over and over creating new wealth while protecting and preserving our environment and the world around us taking scrap metal out of the waste stream and putting it back into the mainstream since max fruman started our business in boston massachusetts back in  the science of processing waste metal has come a long way the rapidly growing scrap metal recycling industry currently generates five billion pounds of scrap metal each year innovative processing technologies now enable us to more effectively clean sort shred shear grade and bale nonferrous scrap metals to enhance its value our extensive relationship with mills around the world and the quality consistency and reliability of our recycled metals provides us with more and better buyers for our customers’ scrap metal that in turn enables us to offer the industry’s most competitive prices for scrap metal taking it out of the waste stream and putting it back into the mainstream one of the oldest familyowned recycling businesses in the northeast four generations and more than  years after max fruman pioneered the metal recycling business here the company is still familyowned and operated in fact we’re one of the oldest familyowned metal recycling businesses in the northeast we take pride in our deep and lasting customer relationships – we’re large enough to service you and small enough to know you the recycling story the concept of recycling has been around as long as mankind – early humans realized that it’s a lot faster and less costly to reuse a product or material than to make a new one from scratch raw materials were often difficult to obtain and process by hand and so materials such as pottery clay were often reprocessed and turned into new earthenware products to name just one example modern recycling got a boost in the midth century when the world wars caused shortages of critical materials such as paper rubber and metals and recycling campaigns – referred to back then as “salvaging” — were launched but as the world emerged from conflict and entered a new era of prosperity recycling took a back seat as an exploding demand for consumer goods a rapidly growing workforce and the introduction of automated processes made it cheaper and easier to manufacture goods from a steady stream of raw materials as the world entered an increasingly volatile political and economic era in the waning decades of the th century recycling slowly grew in popularity as energy costs skyrocketed and access to overseas resources were imperiled governments around the world encouraged recycling through legislation that rewarded people and companies who recycled with refunds and tax credits why recycle it’s very simple – the world is a finite place every scrap drop and ounce of our resources is limited to what’s here right now the earth will not suddenly develop new deposits of iron or aluminum ore we are restricted to the air and water that already exist and we are rapidly making all of it dirty there will not be more coming from somewhere else and the world is very small recycling is the most important and impactful thing we can do to slow – even stop in some cases – the depletion of our natural resources many metals such as steel can be endlessly recycled without loss of quality or durability manufacturing’s impact upon our water and air is significantly reduced when recycled materials are used less energy is consumed less waste is generated and smaller landfills are needed to handle what’s left just how efficient is recycling many of today’s products are manufactured specifically to recapture valuable raw materials automobiles are one of the most recyclable products on the market – up to  of most cars can be recycled and in some cases it approaches  modern appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines are mostly steel and up to  recyclable in fact a large part of the american steel industry uses recycled steel – approximately threequarters of all the steel used in this country is recycled into new products and it doesn’t stop there the energy savings from recycling are impressive too using recycled scrap steel to make new steel products reduces energy consumption by  compared to processing raw iron ore to make virgin steel for the same product as a result recycling has become a  billion industry as more materials are recycled more efficiently and more companies realize there is revenue contained in their metal scraps
