a company that makes steel drums conspired with executives of competing companies to sell the most common type of drum at identical prices to two large buyers he was convicted of violating section  of the sherman act  usc sec  and was sentenced to  months in prison he would have received a shorter sentence had the judge not found that his offense was bidrigging rather than simple price fixing the federal sentencing guideline applicable to bidrigging pricefixing or marketallocation agreements among competitors ussg sec rthe antitrust guideline as it is knownimposes a onelevel increase in the base offense level of a defendant whose offense involves the submission of noncompetitive bids sec rb the commentary oddly does not repeat the term noncompetitive bids instead like the title of the guideline it uses evidently as a synonym for noncompetitive bids the term bid rigging this is clearest in the background commentary which states flatly the sentencing commission has specified a level increase for bidrigging the government too treats the terms as synonyms its brief states bid rigging is simply the submission of any subverted or collusive ie noncompetitive bid the identical bids submitted by heffernan and his cohorts were surely noncompetitive indeed they were plainly rigged and at oral argument the governments lawyer said i think the terms are meant synonymously and theres nothing in the guidelines that suggests otherwise the question presented by the appeal is whether heffernan is indeed a bid rigger or equivalently a noncompetitive bidder and this turns on what the term bid rigging or the less common term noncompetitive bids means  the background commentary explains that the purpose behind the antitrust guideline is to specify the punishment for those antitrust violations about which there is near universal agreement that they can cause serious economic harm these violationsthe core per se offenses that no well very few economists believe can be justifiedare comprised of restrictive agreements among competitors such as horizontal pricefixing including bid rigging and horizontal marketallocation see generally joseph c gallo et al criminal penalties under the sherman act a study of law and economics  research in law and economics   heffernan argues that the term bid rigging and its synonym should be confined to bid rotation what application note  calls the submission of complementary bids for each job the competitors agree which of them shall be the low bidder and the others submit higher bids to make sure the designated bidder wins there was no bid rotation here two purchasers solicited bids and the conspirators submitted identical bids the government argues that bid rigging includes all forms of collusion in a bidding process  the sentencing guideline and its commentary do not define bid rigging for that matter they do not define noncompetitive bids but as we have said they appear to treat these terms as synonyms no case before today has had to decide what either term means in the guidelines we affirmed the convictions of heffernan and two of his coconspirators in united states v rubin  fd  th cir but vacated the sentences because the defendants had been sentenced under the mailfraud guideline rather than under the antitrust guideline which we believed was error so there was not yet any issue of adjusting a pricefixing sentence because of bid rigging  before the guidelines were promulgated and since in cases that do not involve sentencing the term bid rigging though much bandied about in antitrust cases did not denote a distinct offense it was merely a descriptive term for a subset of pricefixing cases so no one bothered with a careful definition nevertheless for what it is worth we point out that the vast majority of cases in which the term has appeared have treated it as a synonym for bid rotation see eg united states v broce  us     s ct     l ed d   united states v ward baking co  us     s ct     l ed d   united states ex rel marcus v hess  us   n   s ct   n   l ed   united states v alex janows  co  fd   th cir moore v united states  fd   th cir united states v walker  fd   th cir united states v all star industries  fd    th cir united states v mmr corp  fd   th cir united states v pippin  fd   th cir new york v hendrickson bros inc  fd   d cir we have mostly cited recent cases but could cite as many decided before the antitrust guideline was promulgated on november   consistently with the fact that the antitrust guideline equates noncompetitive bids to bid rigging many of the cases we have cited and others we could cite use the terms interchangeably to mean bid rotation see eg united states v broce supra  us at    sct at   united states v ward baking co supra  us at    sct at   united states v alex janows  co supra  fd at  united states v all star industries supra  fd at  united states v mmr corp supra  fd at  united states v pippin supra  fd at  new york v hendrickson bros inc supra  fd at  united states v evans  associates construction co  fd    th cir  the cases the government cites for a broader usage of the term bid rigging are inapt the governments favorite case united states v portsmouth paving corp  fd   th cir defines bid rigging as any agreement between competitors pursuant to which contract offers are to be submitted to or withheld from a third party that is not remotely what happened in the present case there was no agreement on who would bid only on what the bid would be the court in portsmouth did say that a requirement that coconspirators agree to reciprocate by submitting complementary bids on future projects is not part of the definition of bid rigging id at  emphasis added but the case was in fact a standard bid rotation case see id at  and n  and the court thought the defendants violation more serious precisely because bids were rotated which eliminated all competition rather than just price competition id at  the other cases that the government cites either quote portsmouth but then go on to make clear that they understand bid rigging to mean bid rotation as in united states v mobile materials inc  fd    th cir and united states v reicher  fd   th cir or simply do not indicate what they mean by bid rigging as in ramsay v vogel  fd   th cir we have found only one case in which bid rigging is used to mean some other kind of interference with the integrity of a bidding system it is harkins amusement enterprises inc v general cinema corp  fd   th cir and it happens to be a postguidelines case so it could not have influenced the sentencing commission in the drafting of the antitrust guideline what is more it was a case that involved an agreement to exclude a competitor from biddinga little like bid rotationnot an agreement to submit identical bids  given that bid rigging appears to have had a reasonably settled meaning at the time the guidelines were promulgated it is plausible no stronger word is possible that the draftsmen of the antitrust guideline meant to incorporate that meaning in which event heffernan would be entitled to be resentenced at the risk of becoming tedious we repeat that the operative term in the guideline itself as distinct from the title and commentarynoncompetitive bidscannot be given a broader meaning but we should also consider the draftsmens purpose in singling out bid rigging for more severe punishment than other forms of price fixing for that purpose might point to a broader meaning the background commentary explains that volume of commerce is liable to be an understated measure in some bidrigging cases for this reason and consistent with preguidelines practice the sentencing commission has specified a level increase for bidrigging application note  further explains that understatement of seriousness is especially likely in cases involving complementary bids it gives as an example a defendant who agrees not to submit a bid or to submit an unreasonably high bid on one occasion in exchange for his being the designated low bidder on another occasion if he doesnt get the second bid he will not have any volume of commerce and even if he does get the second bid his volume of commerce will understate the volume affected by his participation in the bidding scheme the court should consider sentences near the top of the guideline range in such cases  these two pieces of commentary one in the background commentary the other in application note  support the defendants argument that bid rigging means bid rotation the basic criterion that the guideline uses for determining the gravity of an antitrust violation is the volume of commerce attributable to the defendant defined as the volume of commerce done by him or his principal in goods or services that were affected by the violation sec rb if the defendant as part of a bidrotation scheme does not submit a bid and therefore does not make a sale there may be as we have pointed out no commerce to attribute to him or in this case his employer even though he has participated in a scheme that may have had a significant effect on commerce the simplest way to deal with this problem and one that would be consistent with the usual treatment of conspiracy in the guidelines ussg sec bab united states v blankenship  fd   th cir would be to attribute the sales of each member of the conspiracy to all the others the antitrust guideline does not do that the only sales attributed to the conspirator are his own sales or in the case of an individual fixing prices on behalf of his employer or other principal his employers sales hence the need as the draftsmen saw it for a compensatory increase in sentencing when the defendant as part of the conspiracy has not submitted a bid or at least a bid that any buyer would accept hence has not made a sale hence has no volume of commerce  application note  is expressly about bid rotation it advises that in such cases the judge consider going to the top of the guideline range but we know that the guideline requires a onelevel increase in all bidrigging cases if bid rigging means bid rotation so that a onelevel increase in the base offense level has been decreed in all bidrotation cases what sense does it make to advise the judge to go to the top of the guideline range in such cases on the ground that the guideline may understate the seriousness of the defendants conduct in a bidrotation case the onelevel increase had been designed to avoid just such an understatement if bid rigging means nothing more than bid rotation another provision of the guideline moreover refers to a bidrigging case in which the organization submitted one or more complementary bids ussg sec rd implying that some bid rigging does not or at least need not involve bid rotation yet when bidding shenanigans do not take the form of bid rotation the problem of understating the volume of commerce is no more serious than in any other pricefixing caseyet the danger of understatement is the only reason other than preguidelines practice not further specified that the commentary gives for the onelevel increase and it is a reason applicable only to bid rotationif there for purposes of determining the amount of commerce the guideline counts every sale just once whether or not bids rotated or otherwise are involved if one bid riggers bid fails another member of the ring gets the sale and the sale is added to his volume of commerce but the same is true if two ordinary price fixers make identical offers and one is accepted  so the guideline commentary itself does not dispel the mystery but what about the preguidelines practice to which the commentary refers many of the sentencing guidelines codify rather than alter preguidelines sentencing practices see united states sentencing commission guidelines manual ch  pt a p  nov  unfortunately the parties have not told us anything about the preguidelines punishment of price fixing in bidding situations since the government has records of all such punishments its failure to advise us concerning the preguidelines practice suggests though very weakly in light of plausible alternative explanations that the practice does not support its current position our own research has turned up an empirical study which tentatively concluded that bid riggers were indeed punished more severely than other price fixers in the era before the guidelines but the study does not define bid rigging and it suggests that the heavier sentences were attributable to the fact that government purchasers the main users of sealed bidding procurement methods are easy touches for price fixers mark a cohen and david t scheffman the antitrust sentencing guideline is the punishment worth the costs  amcrimlrev    the most complete study of sherman act punishments james c clabault  michael k block sherman act indictments    vols lists punishments for bid rigging separately but does not define the term although a spot check of the cases indicates that the label usually refers to bid rotation and that when the case involves identical bids the authors classify it as simple price fixing  another possibility when the meaning of a guideline is in doubt is to interpret it in accordance with the sentencing guidelines penal philosophy this is not easy to do in general because the guidelines forswear the articulation of such a philosophy see guidelines manual supra ch  pt a pp  andrew von hirsch federal sentencing guidelines do they provide principled guidance  amcrimlrev    the statute authorizing the guidelines however makes reasonably clear that deterrence incapacitation retribution and rehabilitation are the principal considerations in sentencing under the guidelines  usc sec a mistretta v united states  us    s ct    l ed d   united states v rivera  fd   st cir united states v mogel  fd   th cir we can ask which interpretation of bid rigging the broad or the narrow would serve these goals better no one supposes that antitrust defendants require rehabilitation to make them productive lawabiding citizens upon their release from prison incapacitationpreventing this defendant from committing future crimes by keeping him in prison and thus out of circulationdoes not appear to be an important element in the punishment of antitrust violators either their prison sentences are short by contemporary standards considerations of retribution are normally thought to argue for proportioning punishment to the gravity of the crime these considerations would be relevant here if the submission of identical bids were a graver antitrust violation than other forms of price fixing and we shall consider that possibility  deterrence is the goal most pertinent to the antitrust guideline indeed the background commentary says that the controlling consideration underlying this guideline is general deterrence general deterrence means deterrence of others besides the offender specific deterrence means deterring this offender from repeating his offense considerations of general deterrence argue for punishing more heavily those offenses that either are lucrative or are difficult to detect and punish since both attributes go to increase the expected benefits of a crime and hence the punishment required to deter it let us therefore merging considerations of retribution and of deterrence consider whether bid rigging in either the broad sense contended for by the government or the narrow sense bid rotation contended by for the defendant is a graver more lucrative or more difficult to detect and punish offense than ordinary price fixing  bid rigging in the broad as well as in the narrow sense has been an enormously common form of price fixing or at least an enormous emphasis of the department of justice in enforcing the sherman act joseph c gallo joseph l craycraft and steven c bush guess who came to dinner an empirical study of federal antitrust enforcement for the period   review of industrial organization    a sealedbid system of procurement makes it especially easy for price fixers to detect defectors from their conspiracy whether they agree to rotate bids or to submit identical bids as soon as the bids are opened and the winner announced all the bidders know whether the agreement has been violated for they know who the winning bidder was and what his bid was the temptation of a member of a pricefixing conspiracy to cheat his fellows by shading the agreed price is very great and is the bane of price fixers so anything that facilitates the prompt detection of a cheater firms up the conspiracy in addition sealed bidding tends to be used disproportionately by government agencies because of traditional concerns about bribery of public employees which lacking as they do market incentives to minimize their costs are often especially vulnerable to overcharging by their suppliers sealed bidding also tends to be used in the purchase of inputs of a simple standardized character such as the steel drums involved in this case where the costs of individual negotiations with potential suppliers may exceed the benefits these are also the products that it is easiest to fix the prices of because there are few other dimensions on which the conspirators would also have to agree in order to eliminate competition among themselves finally when the buyer is asking suppliers to bid on a specified quantity the normal effect of monopoly or cartel pricing in reducing the quantity of the product demanded is unlikely to operate unless the bids are really exorbitant so the cartel profits are likely to be greater because earned on a larger output  but except for the point about the simple product none of the arguments for punishing price fixing of bids more seriously than other price fixing has any application to this case which for all we know is representative of a great number of cases involving the submission of identical bids the purchasers were not government agencies but large private firms presumably well able to take care of themselves they were not asking for bids on a fixed quantity of drumsthey asked for bids on a number of different quantities they did not employ sealed bids and in fact one of the purchasers was accustomed to asking the high bidders to lower their prices  this kind of bid rigging is indistinguishable from ordinary price fixing in which competitors get together and agree to sell at a uniform price which is all that happened here to punish heffernan more heavily than an ordinary price fixer merely because his customers asked for bids rather than offers would be irrational this irrational result is avoided by interpreting bid rigging equivalently noncompetitive bids consistently with the cases and the preguidelines sentencing practice as meaning bid rotation since heffernan did not engage in bid rigging in this sense he should not have received the onelevel increase in his base offense level that is our best guess as to the meaning of the antitrust guideline but we invite the sentencing commission to rewrite the guideline its treatment of bidding is a muddle  heffernans sentence is vacated and the case is remanded with instructions to resentence him in conformity with this opinion  so ordered  hon albert j
