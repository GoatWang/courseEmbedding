most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which

although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using these parameters investors have

resonant is creating innovative software intellectual property ip and a services platform that has the ability to increase designer efficiency reduce the time to market and lower unit costs in the designs of filters for radio frequency rf frontends for the mobile device industry the rf frontend rffe is the circuitry in a mobile device responsible for analog signal processing and is located between the devices antenna and its digital baseband the rf frontend industry is undergoing dramatic increases in growth and complexity due to band proliferation carrier aggregation ca multipleinput multipleoutput mimo antenna design the filtering problems of rf frontends are rapidly becoming so complex that very few companies can solve them at resonant we are developing a fundamentally new technology that we call infinite synthesized networks® or isn® to configure and connect resonators the building blocks of rf filters filters are a critical component of the rf frontend used to select desired radio frequency signals and reject unwanted signals our isn® platform allows us to develop unique custom designs that address the increasing complexity of the rffe due to carrier aggregation ca by both reducing the size of the filter and improving performance our goal is to utilize our isn® platform to support our customers in reducing their time to develop complex filter designs and
