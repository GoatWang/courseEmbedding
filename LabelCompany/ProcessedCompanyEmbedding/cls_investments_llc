have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results
