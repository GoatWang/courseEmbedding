funds have two important traits when you compare mutual funds it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they

advantage select funds can reduce risk index funds fall as far as the market they track but investors don’t have to over time they can gain more by losing less august  share gain by losing less there are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market losing less – the socalled lowdownside capture approach – holds appeal for investors especially considering that  of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to  of market downturns  downside capture a fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness for example if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only  as far as the market its downside capture ratio is  if it fell  more than the market its downside capture ratio is   see how american funds delivered indexbeating returns by losing less a closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our us stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times  why it matters consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for longterm investors funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride making it easier for those with longterm objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets the arithmetic of loss the ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss consider the following if a  investment loses  its value drops to  in order for the investment to return to the  level that  must do more than gain  which would only bring it to  it needs to double digging out of a hole is never easy but the shallower the hole the shorter the climb better positioned by losing less the farther an investment falls the longer the path back to break even some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound to mitigate risk seek funds that have held up better during declines looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness when we added

is registered as a brokerdealer under the securities exchange act of  “exchange act” and serves on an agency basis as principal underwriter of the trusts  each trust holds a portfolio of securities “portfolio securities” consisting of substantially all of the securities in substantially the same weighting as the component securities of the benchmark index that it tracks the “index securities” there are currently four trusts “current trusts” the benchmark indices for the current trusts the “initial benchmark indices” are compiled by bony the “bony index provider” pursuant to guidelines adopted by bony for the index provider the bony personnel involved in compiling the benchmark indices cannot include any bony employees who are members of the bony division that provides trustee services to the trusts any brokerdealer affiliated with bony bonys asset management division or bonys private banking group  in the future applicants may offer additional trusts based on other benchmark indices “future trusts” any future trust will a be organized under new york state law pursuant to a trust agreement substantially identical to the trust agreements b be sponsored by the sponsor and c comply with the terms and conditions of the requested order no entity that creates compiles sponsors or maintains a benchmark index will be an affiliated person as defined in section a of the act or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of the sponsor distributor or promoter of a trust  trust shares units of beneficial interest in the trusts are designed to provide investors with an instrument that closely tracks the benchmark indices trades like a share of common stock and pays periodic dividends proportionate to those paid by the index securities to the extent they exceed the trusts fees and expenses the trustee makes adjustments to the portfolio securities to reflect changes made by the bony index provider to the composition and weighting of the index securities all adjustments to the portfolio securities are made by the trustee as set forth in the trust agreements and are nondiscretionary applicants state that the trustee consistent with its fiduciary duties may utilize a brokerdealer that is an “affiliated person” as defined in section a of the act of the trustee each an “affiliated brokerdealer” in executing the transactions that are necessitated by the required adjustments applicants state that neither bony nor any affiliated brokerdealer purchases or sells drs on a principal basis or intends to sell drs or any other securities to any trust on a principal basis bony and its affiliated brokerdealers would engage in transactions with a trust on an agency basis only  trust fees and expenses are first paid out of income received by the trust in the form of dividends and other distributions on portfolio securities each trust pays the trustee a fee ranging from  to  of the net asset value “nav” of the trust on an annualized basis such percentage to vary based on the nav of the trust the trustee in its discretion may waive all or any portion of such fee  pursuant to a license agreement “license agreement” the bony index start printed page provider has granted the sponsor a license to use the benchmark indices and certain trademarks of bony the sponsor will pay the bony index provider an annual licensing fee for each benchmark index and will seek reimbursement from each trust for the fee charged in connection with its benchmark index the sponsor will pay the distributor a flat annual fee for services provided to the trusts the sponsor will not seek reimbursement from any trust for such payment without obtaining prior exemptive relief from the commission  trust shares are issued in aggregations of  shares “creation units” orders to purchase creation units generally must be delivered to the distributor through a party that has executed a participant agreement with the distributor and trustee and is either a a participant in the continuous net settlement system of the national securities clearing corporation “nscc” and the nscc process of placing orders the “trust shares clearing process” or b a depository trust company “dtc” participant but such entity or person is not required to be a nasdaq member  an investor wishing to purchase a creation unit from the trust will have to transfer to the trustee a “portfolio deposit” consisting of the following a a portfolio of securities substantially similar in composition and weighting to the index securities “deposit securities”  b a cash payment equal to the dividends accrued on the portfolio securities since the last dividend payment on the portfolio securities net of expenses and liabilities “income net of expense amount” and c a cash payment or credit to equalize any differences between the market value of the deposit securities and the nav of the trust on a per creation unit basis “balancing amount” and together with the income net of expense amount the “cash component” the sponsor or its designee makes available on each business day a list of the names and the required number of shares of each of the deposit securities in the current portfolio deposit as well as the income net of expense amount effective through and including the previous business day per outstanding trust share the sponsor or its designee makes available on the exchange every  seconds of each business day the sum of the income net of expense amount and the value of the deposit securities on a per trust share basis an investor making a portfolio deposit is charged a service fee “transaction fee” to be paid to the trustee to defray the trustees costs in processing transactions for the trust  orders to purchase creation units are placed with the distributor who is responsible for transmitting orders to the trustee the distributor issues confirmations of acceptance issues delivery instructions to the trustee to implement the delivery of creation units and maintains records of the orders and the confirmations the distributor also is responsible for delivering prospectuses to purchasers of creation units and may provide certain other administrative services  persons purchasing creation units from the trust may hold the trust shares or sell some or all of them in the secondary market trust shares of the current trusts are listed on nasdaq and all trust shares will be listed on a national securities exchange as defined in section a of the act “exchange” trust shares are traded in the secondary market as individual units ie in less than creation units in the same manner as other equity securities participating parties act as market makers “market makers” on nasdaq and maintain a market for trust shares the price of each trust share that trades on nasdaq is based on the current bidoffer market transactions involving trust shares on nasdaq are subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges applicants state that the price at which trust shares trade is disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the continuous ability to purchase or redeem creation units at their nav which ensures that trust shares do not trade at a material premium or discount in relation to their nav  purchasers of creation units include institutional investors and arbitrageurs which include institutional investors market makers or specialists of an exchange also may purchase trust shares in connection with their market making activities secondary market purchasers of trust shares include both institutional and retail investors  applicants make available a standard trust shares product description “product description” to members and member organizations for start printed page distribution to investors purchasing trust shares in accordance with exchange rules currently the rules of the national association of securities dealers “nasd” require that nasd members distribute a product description to all purchasers of trust shares the product description provides a plain english overview of a trust including the material risks and potential rewards of owning trust shares and discloses the salient aspects of trust shares the product description advises investors that a prospectus for trust shares is available without charge from the investors broker or from the distributor applicants believe that the volume of purchase transactions in which an investor will not receive a product description does not constitute a significant portion of the market activity in trust shares  trust shares are not individually redeemable except upon termination of the trust trust shares are redeemable in creation units only an investor redeeming a creation unit will receive a portfolio of securities typically identical in composition and weighting to the deposit securities as of the date the redemption request was made “redemption securities” the redeeming investor may receive the cash equivalent of an index security a when the trustee determines that an index security is likely to be unavailable or available in insufficient quantity for delivery by the trust or b upon the request of the redeeming investor because for example the redeeming investor is restricted by regulation or otherwise from holding an index security the redeeming investor also may receive or may pay cash in an amount equal to the cash component in effect on the relevant business day for portfolio deposits “cash redemption amount” the redeeming investor will pay a transaction fee which will be calculated in the same manner as a transaction fee payable in connection with the purchase of a creation unit on the relevant business day  because each trust ordinarily redeems in kind rather than in cash the trustee will not have to maintain cash reserves for redemptions this allows the assets of each trust to be committed as fully as possible to tracking the relevant benchmark index and allows each trust to track the relevant benchmark index more closely than other market basket products that must allocate a portion of their assets to cash for redemptions applicants legal analysis  applicants request an order under a section c of the act granting an exemption from sections a  d d and ac of the act and rule c under the act b sections c and b of the act granting an exemption from sections a and  of the act and c section d and rule d under the act to permit certain joint transactions  section c of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act sections  and a of the act  section  of the act defines a uit as an investment company that among other things issues only redeemable securities section a of the act defines a redeemable security as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon its presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately a proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent because trust shares would not be individually redeemable applicants request an order that would permit the trust to register as a uit and issue trust shares that are redeemable in creation units only applicants state that investors may purchase and redeem trust shares through the trust in creation units applicants further state that because the market price of creation units is disciplined by arbitrage opportunities investors should be able to sell individual trust shares in the secondary market at approximately nav section d of the act and rule c under the act  section d of the act among other things prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security that is being currently offered to the public by or through an underwriter except at the current public offering price described in the prospectus rule c under the act generally requires that a dealer selling redeeming or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its nav next computed after receipt of a tender of the security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell the security applicants state that secondary market trading in trust shares takes place at negotiated prices not at a current offering price described in the prospectus and not at a price based on nav thus purchases and sales of trust shares in the secondary market do not comply with section d and rule c and applicants request an exemption from these provisions  applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section d its provisions and those of rule c appear to have been designed to a prevent dilution caused by certain riskless trading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers b prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers and c assure an orderly distribution of shares by eliminating price competition from dealers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price applicants believe that none of these purposes is thwarted by permitting trust shares to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices applicants state that secondary market trading in trust shares does not involve the trust directly and cannot therefore result in dilution of trust assets applicants also state that to the extent different prices exist during a trading day or from day to day for trust shares such variances occur as a result of thirdparty market forces such as supply and demand and not as a result of unjust or discriminatory manipulation therefore applicants assert that secondary market transactions in trust shares do not create discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers finally applicants contend that the proposed distribution system is orderly because arbitrage activity ensures that the difference between the market price of trust shares and their nav remains narrow section d of the act  section d of the act provides in pertinent part that the prospectus delivery exemption provided to dealer transactions by section  of the securities act does not apply to any transaction in a redeemable security issued by a uit applicants request an exemption from section d to permit dealers in trust shares to rely on the prospectus delivery exemption provided by section  of the securities act start printed page   applicants state that the secondary market for trust shares is significantly different from the typical secondary market for uit securities which is usually maintained by the sponsor of the uit trust shares are listed on an exchange and trade in the same manner as listed securities issued by operating companies and closedend investment companies dealers selling shares of operating companies and closedend investment companies in the secondary market are generally not required to deliver a prospectus to a purchaser  applicants contend that trust shares as listed securities merit a reduction in the compliance costs and regulatory burdens resulting from the imposition of prospectus delivery obligations in the secondary market because trust shares are exchangelisted prospective investors have access to several types of market information about the product applicants state that quotations last sale price and volume information are continually available on a realtime basis through the consolidated tape and are available throughout the day on brokers computer screens and other electronic services the previous days price and volume information also is published in the financial section of newspapers the sponsor publishes daily on a per trust share basis the income net of expense amount the funds web site contains quantitative information updated on a daily basis regarding the previous business days nav and the reported closing price the web site also includes for each trust a calculation of the premium or discount of the closing price against nav and data in chart format displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the closing price against the nav within appropriate ranges for each of the four previous calendar quarters  in addition secondary market purchasers generally receive the product description applicants state that while the product description is not intended as a substitute for a prospectus it contains pertinent information about trust shares applicants also note that trust shares are understandable to retail investors as a product that tracks the benchmark indices section ac of the act  section ac of the act requires among other things that a uits trust indenture prohibit payments to the trusts depositor in the case of a trust the sponsor and any affiliated person of the depositor except payments for performing certain administrative services applicants request an exemption from section ac to permit any trust to reimburse the sponsor for certain licensing registration and marketing expenses  applicants state that ordinarily a sponsor of a uit has an opportunity to profit in connection with the creation of a trust in two ways—through the difference between the acquisition cost of the securities and their value on the date of deposit in the trust and to the extent a secondary market is maintained for units through the imposition of sales charges on resales of units expenses normally incurred in the creation and maintenance of a trust can then be offset against such profits applicants assert however that under the proposed structure the usual sources of income are not available because the sponsor does not impose a sales load or deposit index securities into the trust applicants contend that the motivation for the limitations imposed in section ac of the act was the fear that sponsors could take unfair advantage of a trust to profit when profits were already being generated through sales charges and market gains on the securities deposited by the sponsor applicants contend that no such opportunity to profit exists for sponsor  applicants state that permitting a trust to reimburse the sponsor for certain of the trusts expenses is no more disadvantageous to the holders of trust shares than allowing the expenses to be imposed indirectly as offsets to sales loads and other charges as is done by typical uits applicants state that a trust pays the sponsor only its actual outofpocket expenses finally applicants state that the payment is capped at  basis points of the trusts nav on an annualized basis with any expenses in excess of that amount to be absorbed by the sponsor section a of the act  section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such person from selling any security to or purchasing any security from the investment company section a defines “affiliated person” to include any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person and any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person section a provides that a control relationship will be presumed where one person owns  or more of another persons voting securities applicants state that because the definition of “affiliated person” includes any person owning  or more or more than  of an issuers outstanding voting securities every purchaser of a creation unit will be an affiliated person of the trust so long as  or fewer creation units are in existence applicants request an exemption from section a under sections c and b to permit persons that are affiliated persons solely by virtue of a  or more or more than  ownership interest in a trust or affiliated persons of such persons that are not otherwise affiliated with the trusts to purchase and redeem creation units through inkind transactions  section b authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a if the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and with the general purposes of the act applicants assert that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting the affiliated persons described above from making inkind purchases and redemptions of creation units the composition of a portfolio deposit made by a purchaser like the redemption securities and cash redemption amount given to a redeeming investor is the same regardless of the investors identity and is valued under the same objective standards applied to valuing the portfolio securities in connection with determining the trusts nav therefore applicants state that inkind purchases and redemptions afford no opportunity for the affiliated persons described above to effect a transaction detrimental to other holders of trust shares applicants also believe that inkind start printed page purchases and redemptions do not result in abusive selfdealing or overreaching by affiliated persons of the funds section d of the act and rule d under the act  section d of the act and rule d under the act prohibit any affiliated person of or principal underwriter for a registered investment company or any affiliated person of the affiliated person or the principal underwriter acting as principal from effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other arrangement or profitsharing plan in which the investment company participates unless an application regarding the joint transaction has been filed with the commission and granted by order under rule d in passing upon such applications the commission considers whether the participation of the registered investment company in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants request an order under rule d that would permit a trust to reimburse the sponsor for the payment to the bony index provider of an annual license fee under the license agreement applicants believe that relief is necessary because the sponsor may be deemed an affiliated person of the trust as defined in section a of the act and the trusts undertaking to reimburse the sponsor might be deemed a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which the trust is a participant in contravention of section d and rule d  the license agreement allows applicants to use the benchmark indices as bases for trust shares and to use certain of bonys trade name and trademark rights applicants believe that bony is a valuable name that is wellknown to investors and believe that investors wish to invest in instruments that closely mirror the benchmark indices in view of this applicants state that it is necessary to obtain from bony the license agreement so that appropriate reference to bony may be made in materials describing trust shares and the trust applicants assert that the terms and provisions of the license agreement are comparable to the terms and provisions of other similar license agreements and that the annual license fee is for fair value is in an amount comparable to that which would be charged by the bony index provider for similar arrangements and is in an amount comparable to that charged by licensors in connection with the formation of other uits based on other indices for these reasons applicants state that the proposed license fee arrangement satisfies the standards of section d and rule d applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  each trusts prospectus and product description will clearly disclose that for purposes of the act trust shares are issued by a registered investment company and the acquisition of trust shares by investment companies is subject to the restrictions of section d of the act except as permitted by an exemptive order that permits registered investment companies to invest in trust shares beyond the limits in section da subject to certain terms and conditions including that the registered investment company enter into an agreement with the trust regarding the terms of the investment  as long as a trust operates in reliance on the requested order the trust shares will be listed on an exchange  the web site for the trusts which will be publicly accessible at no charge will contain the following information on a per trust share basis for each trust a the prior business days nav and the reported closing price and a calculation of the premium or discount of such price against such nav and b data in chart format displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the daily closing price against the nav within appropriate ranges for each of the four previous calendar quarters in addition the product description for each trust will state that the web site for the trusts has information about the premiums and discounts at which the trust shares have traded  the prospectus and annual report for each trust will also include a the information listed in condition b above i in the case of the prospectus for the most recently completed year and the most recently completed quarter or quarters as applicable and ii in the case of the annual report for the immediately preceding five years as applicable and b the following data calculated on a per trust share basis for one five and ten year periods or life of that trust i the cumulative total return and the average annual total return based on nav and closing price and ii the cumulative total return of the relevant benchmark index  before a trust may rely on the order the

below the trustee calculates the nav of each trust divides that amount by the total number of shares outstanding yielding a “per trust share nav” multiplies the per trust share nav by the number of

accordingly applicants believe that the pricing transparency for drs should be equivalent to that of other securities that are traded and priced on national securities exchanges because there are no

including purchases of creation units or those involving an issuer applicants state that persons purchasing creation units will be cautioned in the prospectus that some activities on their part may depending on the circumstances result in their being deemed statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the securities act for example a brokerdealer firm andor its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes creation units after placing an order with the distributor breaks them down into the constituent trust shares and sells trust shares directly to its customers or if it chooses to couple the purchase of a supply of new trust shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for trust shares the prospectus states that whether a person is an underwriter depends upon all the facts and circumstances pertaining to that persons activities the prospectus also states that dealers who are

american funds have two important traits when you compare mutual funds it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers it’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods characteristics of

examined the large universe of equity funds in morningstar’s us and foreign largecap categories over a year period and looked for funds with two traits those within the lowest  of expenses and those

chart below not all funds are equal most in fact rarely outpace the index however funds with the lowest expenses have tended to do better than their peers and funds with high manager ownership have done even better than that significantly the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five and year periods a portfolio of largecap funds with lower expense ratios

advantage select funds can reduce risk index funds fall as far as the market they track but investors don’t have to over time they can gain more by losing less august  share gain by losing less there are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market losing less – the socalled lowdownside capture approach – holds appeal for investors especially considering that  of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to  of market downturns  downside capture a fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness for example if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only  as far as the market its downside capture ratio is  if it fell  more than the market its downside capture ratio is   see how american funds delivered indexbeating returns by losing less a closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our us stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times  why it matters consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for longterm investors funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride making it easier for those with longterm objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets the arithmetic of loss the ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss consider the following if a  investment loses  its value drops to  in order for the investment to return to the  level that  must do more than gain  which would only bring it to  it needs to double digging out of a hole is never easy but the shallower the hole the shorter the climb better positioned by losing less the farther an investment falls the longer the path back to break even some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound to mitigate risk seek funds that have held up better during declines looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness when we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has on average delivered indexbeating results finding funds that can mitigate risk within the universe of large cap us funds screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that on average outpaced its peers as well as the sp  index further narrowing the lowdownside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further the chart shown here is based on data for rolling fiveyear periods for the  years ended december   see methodology investments are not fdicinsured nor
