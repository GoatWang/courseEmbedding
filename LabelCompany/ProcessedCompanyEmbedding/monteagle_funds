provided by morningstar inc ii organized under the laws of texas or iii that during the most recent fiscal year derived at least  of its revenues or profits from goods produced or sold investments made or services performed in texas or that have at least  of its assets in texas in determining whether a company meets this condition the subadviser may rely on such information and sources as the subadviser deems reasonable and appropriate the fund will be invested across a broad market capitalization spectrum including small mid and large capitalization companies the subadviser typically selects companies in which to invest by performing an initial market capitalization screening of  or more the subadviser controls for fund risks by performing fundamental analyses of the initially screened companies the subadviser analyzes factors such as financial conditions industry position and market and economic conditions and trends to select investments and make buy and sell decisions once the subadviser selects companies in which to invest the subadviser initially equally weights the companies within each sector the subadviser does not equally weight each sector within the fund the fund will not invest  or more of its assets in any industry or group of related industries however the fund does intend to have a high level of investments in the oil and gas industry due to the fund’s management team’s belief that such industry has superior growth opportunities except as otherwise permitted by the fund’s nonfundamental policies any concentration in a specific sector or industry will be under this  concentration threshold principal investment risks an investment in the fund is subject to investment risks including the possible loss of some or all of the principal amount investedthere can be no assurance that the fund will be successful in meeting its investment objectivegenerally the fund will be subject to the following additional risks investment selectiona

conditions business and sector risk from time to time a particular set of circumstances may affect a particular industry or certain companies within an industry while having little or no impact on other industries or other companies within the industry geographic concentration risk the fund’s investments are concentrated in texas and therefore the fund will be susceptible to adverse market political regulatory social economic and geographic events affecting texasthe fund’s performance may be more volatile than the performance of more geographically diverse fundssince one of the main industries in texas is mining and logging including the oil and gas sectors texas is particularly susceptible to economic environmental and political activities affecting this industry oil and gas sector risk companies in the oil and gas sector may have significant operations in areas at risk for natural disasters social unrest and environmental damagethese companies may also be at risk for increased government regulations and intervention litigation and negative publicity and perception large company risk the fund may invest in larger more established companies which may be unable to respond to new competitive challengesadditionally large companies may be unable to attain the high growth rates of successful small companies especially during extended periods of economic expansion

of the monteagle value fund is long term growth of capital principal investment strategy  the fund takes a longterm or buy and hold approach to managing the funds portfolio the fund invests primarily in common stocks of medium and large capitalization us companies those with market capitalizations of  billion or more that are believed to be undervalued based on value characteristics such as lower relative price valuations above average earnings per share growth and higher dividend yields compared to the sp  index the stock will be sold when the stock is no longer undervalued or when the fundamentals of the company that affect revenue and profitability have changed significantly either in a positive or negative direction principal risks risks in general domestic economic growth and market conditions interest rate levels and political events are among the factors affecting the securities markets of the fund’s investments there is the risk that these and other factors may adversely affect the fund’s performance the loss of money is a risk of investing in the fund the fund could underperform other investments investment selection risk the fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective is dependent on the subadviser’s ability to identify profitable investment opportunities for the fund company risk the fund might decrease in value in response to the activities and financial prospects of an individual company in the fund’s portfolio the value of an individual company can be more volatile than the market as a whole volatility risk common stocks tend to be more volatile than other investment choices because the fund will emphasize various growth industries the value of your shares is likely to be more volatile than a fund that invests in a broader range of industries portfolio turnover risk generally the fund intends to invest for longterm purposes however the fund’s rate of portfolio turnover will depend upon market and other conditions and it will not be a limiting factor when the subadviser believes that portfolio changes are necessary or appropriate periods of portfolio “repositioning” may result in a high portfolio turnover rate a high portfolio turnover would result in correspondingly greater brokerage commission expenses and may result in the distribution to shareholders of additional capital gains for tax purposes these factors may negatively affect the fund’s performance small and mid capitalization risk the fund may invest in midcapitalization companies which involve greater risks than those associated with larger more established companies smaller companies may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements for reasons including that the stocks are generally traded in lower volume and that the issuers are more sensitive to changing conditions and have less certain growth prospects sector risks while the fund will not concentrate its investments in any one industry or group of related industries by investing more than  of the portfolio the fund may make significant investments in certain sectors or group of sectors within a particular industry or industries from time to time value style risk the fund invests in a style that emphasizes “value stocks” the market may not agree with the determination that a stock is undervalued and the stock’s price may not increase to what the fund’s investment

what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by
