committee’s choice and on june   the synod of the christian reformed church crc of north america ratified the decision “higher education is at a very challenging era of its history right now in the united states and it’s not clear what paths forward are the best” le roy said “i’m convinced that with the kinds of minds and capable people we have at calvin that together we will discover some powerful ways forward” he is a strong believer in the role of christian liberal arts in the landscape of christian higher education “you can’t diminish the importance of preparing students for meaningful work and yet that’s one part of a whole life lived well” he said “but a lot of it has to do with what we do after  o’clock as parents as citizens as community members as patrons of the arts… christian higher education then says all of faith is relevant to all of that life” michael k le roy and andrea nelson le roy are both ordained elders in the presbyterian church they have three

ready to cheer on the knights in every sport president le roy is eager to take on the challenge of leading calvin “i’ve wanted to be in the place—and i’ve only ever wanted to be in the place—where i

the minority parent while the census bureau classified them in terms of the fathers racial or ethnic identity since the s both agencies have based the childrens race on the racial identity of the mother many multiracial  children of european american mothers have therefore been designated as white rather than as biracial since the mids however adoption agencies have tended to describe blended children as racially mixed or biracial in order to attract white adoptive parents by appealing to their eurocentric bias such flexibility has not been extended so readily to multi generational individuals their experience carries with it the implicit stigma of concubinage rape and illegitimacy and the parents and families of these individuals have typically been seen as african american attitudes toward native americans and latinos—two other populations that have experienced significant miscegenation with european americans—provide a point of contrast the european american as well as the native american and latino communities have more openly acknowledged multiple racial and cultural backgrounds in the discourse on identity in these populations as well however the same divisive and pernicious colorism that has infected africandescent americans has arisen with the result that  lighterskinned and otherwise more europeanappearing latinos and native americans are  treated preferentially within and outside their communities nevertheless  greater openness among these groups to multiracialism has mitigated the generational differences as the primary factor determining the legitimacy of multiracial identity multigenerational individuals of european american and african american decent therefore find themselves at odds not only with the larger society and the african american community but often with firstgeneration individuals as well since most africandescent americans have some european american ancestry in their genealogy but identify themselves as black blacks often accuse multigenerational individuals of trying to escape the stigma attached to blackness  some firstgeneration individuals contend that their own biracial experience is the legitimate starting point for a blended identity daniel g reginald more than black multiracial identity and the new racial order philadelphia temple university press   putting racism white supremacy and white privilege in context posted in articles campus life media archive religion united states on  z by steven putting racism white supremacy and white privilege in context chimes the official student newspaper of calvin college grand rapids michigan  joseph kuilema professor of social work a group of students went to write positive messages on snow on cars following the racist comments that were written photo credit katelyn bosch on sunday nov  two members of our community wrote “white power” and drew a swastika in the snow on a car many members of our community condemned these actions as hateful and totally incompatible with our mission in some ways that’s the easy part what has been more difficult is to acknowledge that what occurred was not an isolated incident a freak occurrence in an otherwise loving and inclusive community while few members of this community openly espouse white supremacy many members of our community continue to deny white privilege it must be clearly stated that those who deny white privilege functionally believe in white supremacy whether they have the courage to write it on a car or not in his remarks on the incident president le roy rightly identified the statement “white power” and the swastika with white supremacy and the ideology that shaped nazi germany apartheid south africa chattel slavery in the us and the jim crow south he focused on two scriptures the story of jesus and the woman caught in adultery john  and jesus warning that before we remove the splinter in the eye of the other we ought to attend to the plank in our own matthew  luke  he did this largely in the context of not demonizing those who committed these acts and that is an appropriate concern christians should never reduce anyone to the worst thing they have done none of us stands innocent before the lord however we should never mention nazi germany apartheid south africa or the jim crow south without identifying the connections to us here at calvin college and the brutality right here in grand rapids… …at the same time i have to respectfully disagree with president le roy’s assertion that we are all racists i joseph kuilema am certainly a racist as a white male i benefit tremendously from institutions and systems that have been built by and for people like me this is how the social sciences define racism not as merely the product of prejudice explicit or implicit bias but a system of power based on the invention of the “white race” by people in power by this definition we are not all racists… read the entire article here tags
