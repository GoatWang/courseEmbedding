better the hardness or softness of a pastel depends on the amount of binder or filler in its makeup there are advantages to each style of pastel return to all questions what are the advantages of soft pastels soft pastels contain less binder which gives them their velvety texture or “bloom” they contain more pigment so the color is rich and can easily be blended or smudged with a finger or soft
