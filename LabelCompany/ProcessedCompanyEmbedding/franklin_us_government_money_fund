letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average
