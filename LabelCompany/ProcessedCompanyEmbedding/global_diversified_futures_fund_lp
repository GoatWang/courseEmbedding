willowbridge traded its select investment program using the argo trading system argo on behalf of willowbridge master argo was a proprietary computerized systematic trading system that relied on technical information it was not a trendfollowing system but did follow a trend when the opportunity arises argo uses the concepts of pattern recognition supportresistance levels and counter trend liquidations in making trading decisions argo determines on a daily basis whether to be long short or flat the various commodities in its portfolio   pattern recognition supportresistance levels and countertrend liquidations are defined as follows pattern recognition is the ability to identify patterns that appear to have acted as precursors of price advances or declines in the past a support level is a previous lowa price level under the current market price at which point buying interest is expected to be sufficiently strong to overcome selling pressure a resistance level is a previous higha price level over the current market price at which point selling pressure is expected to overcome buying pressure and a price advance is expected to be turned back a countertrend liquidation is the closing out of a position after a significant price move on the assumption that the market is due for a correction effective january   willowbridge will trade the partnerships assets allocated to

mediumterm capital growth independent of stock and bond market returns within a rigorous risk management framework the diversified program applies a systematic and broadly diversified global investment system which deploys multiple investment strategies that primarily through the use of derivatives seek to identify and exploit directional moves in the market behavior of a broad range of financial instruments and other assets including but not limited to currencies interest rates indices debt securities including bonds and commodities including energy metal and agricultural commodities by maintaining comparatively small exposure to any individual market and maintaining positions in a variety of contracts aspect aims to achieve longterm diversification generally the diversified program maintains positions in the majority of traded markets market concentration varies according to the strength of signals volatility and liquidity amongst other factors the emphasis is upon structuring a genuinely diversified set of market risk allocations that is designed to maximize the probability of returns wherever profit opportunities appear market exposures are monitored daily and the level of exposure of the diversified program in each market is quantifiable at all times and changes in accordance with market volatility and liquidity the diversified program employs an automated system to collect process and analyze market data including current and historical price data and identify and exploit directional moves in market behavior the diversified program trades across a variety of frequencies to exploit trends over a range of timescales positions are taken according to the aggregate signal and are adjusted to attempt to control risk capital fund management sa cfm traded its discus program on behalf of cfm master the discus program was a proprietary multistrategy  statistical and systematic program that sought to identify prevailing market conditions and adopt the most efficient trading strategy for those conditions the strategy at times followed medium to long term trends and at other times established short term positions in the direction of or opposite a trend cfm designed the discus program to trade a diversified portfolio of approximately  futures and forward contracts among the following sectors short medium and long term interest rates

system the altis global futures portfolio trading system currently trades in over  futures markets on recognized futures exchanges globally altis may add or remove markets from the trading system in response to changes in market liquidity under the fully automated system changes in market prices are forecast over a number of future periods and the portfolio is optimized to take best advantage of these forecasts forecasts are derived from a number of quantitative market phenomena for instance directional movement components look for persistent upward or downward price movements over a number of timescales and antitrending components are invoked when such movements may have gone too far too fast other inputs are derived from changes in perceived instrument volatility and the effect of one market against another closely correlated one under the trading system the relevant return forecasts together with their corresponding measures of risk and market correlation are reestimated daily portfolio resources are then allocated to where the approach expects significant changes in prices bearing in mind the need to diversify exposure to risk as a result portfolio composition is not fixed there are no preassigned weightings to markets or sectors moreover no one market is treated differently to its peers in terms of parameter inputs due to the number of inputs or indicators used and their application across a broad range of markets portfolio changes are generally small except perhaps during periods of extreme volatility krom river trading program krom river trades its commodity

its trading account consisting of cash and cash margin net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts and iii interest receivable because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the partnership while substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity no such illiquidity occurred during the year ended december   to minimize the risk relating to low margin deposits the partnershipfunds follow certain trading policies including i the partnershipfunds invests their assets only in commodity interests that the advisors believes are traded in sufficient volume to permit ease of taking and liquidating positions sufficient volume in this context refers to a level of liquidity that the advisor believes will permit it to enter and exit trades without noticeably moving the market ii an advisor will not initiate additional positions in any commodity if these positions would result in aggregate positions requiring a margin of more than   of the partnerships net assets allocated to that advisor iii the partnershipfunds may occasionally accept physical delivery of a commodity unless such delivery is disposed of promptly by retendering the warehouse receipt representing the delivery to the appropriate clearinghouse the physical commodity position is fully hedged iv the partnershipfunds do not employ the trading technique commonly known as pyramiding in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as margin for the purchases or sale of additional positions in the same or related commodities v the partnershipfunds do not utilize borrowings other than shortterm borrowings if the partnershipfunds take delivery of any cash commodities vi the advisors may from time to time employ trading strategies such as spreads or straddles on behalf of the partnershipfunds spreads and straddles describe commodity futures trading strategies involving the simultaneous buying and selling of futures contracts on the same commodity but involving different delivery dates or markets   vii the partnershipfunds will not permit the churning of its commodity trading account the term churning refers to the practice of entering and exiting trades with a frequency unwarranted by legitimate efforts to profit from the trades indicating the desire to generate commission income from january   through december   the partnerships average margin to equity ratio ie the percentage of assets on deposit required for margin was approximately  the foregoing margin to equity ratio takes into account cash held in the partnerships name as well as the allocable value of the positions and cash held on behalf of the partnership in the name of the funds in the normal course of business the partnership and the funds are parties to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments these financial instruments include forwards futures options and swaps whose values are based upon an underlying asset index or reference rate and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specified terms at specified future dates or in the case of derivative commodity instruments to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash through physical delivery or with another financial instrument these instruments may be traded on an exchange or overthecounter otc exchangetraded instruments are standardized and include futures and certain forwards and option contracts otc contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include swaps and certain forwards and option contracts each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those relating to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risk in general the risks associated with otc contracts are greater than those associated with exchangetraded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an otc contract the general partner estimates that at any given time approximately  to  of the partnershipfunds contracts are traded otc the risk to the limited partners that have purchased redeemable units is limited to the amount of their share of the partnerships assets and undistributed profits this limited liability is a result of the organization of the partnership as a limited partnership under new york law market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the partnershipfunds due to market changes including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded by the partnershipfunds the partnershipfunds are exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract the partnershipsfunds risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition and not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments the partnershipsfunds risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the partnershipfunds to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events the partnershipfunds have credit risk and concentration risk as cgmms  co or a cgm affiliate is the sole counterparty or broker with respect to the partnershipsfunds assets credit risk with respect to exchangetraded instruments is reduced to the extent that through cgm and ms  co the partnershipsfunds counterparty is an exchange or clearing organization as both a buyer and seller of options the funds pay or receive a premium at the outset and then bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option written options expose the funds to potentially unlimited liability for purchased options the risk of loss is limited to the premiums paid certain written put options permit cash settlement and do not require the option holder to own the reference asset the funds do not consider these contracts to be guarantees the general partner monitors and attempts to control the partnershipsfunds risk exposure on a daily basis through financial credit and risk management monitoring systems and accordingly believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the partnershipfunds may be subject these monitoring systems generally allow the general partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with riskadjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics in addition online monitoring systems provide account analysis of futures forwards and options positions by sector margin requirements gain and loss transactions and collateral positions see also item  financial statements and supplementary data for further information on financial instrument risk included in the notes to financial statements other than the risks inherent in commodity futures and other derivatives trading the partnership knows of no trends demands commitments events or uncertainties which will result in or which are reasonably likely to result in the partnerships liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way the limited partnership agreement provides that the general partner may in its discretion cause the partnership to cease trading operations and liquidate all open positions under certain circumstances including a decrease in net asset value per redeemable unit to less than  as of the close of business on any trading day   b capital resources i the partnership has made no material commitments for capital expenditures ii the partnerships capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by gains or losses on trading and by expenses interest income redemptions of redeemable units and distributions of profits if any gains or losses on trading cannot be predicted market movements in commodities are dependent upon fundamental and technical factors which the advisors may or may not be able to identify such as changing supply and demand relationships weather government agricultural commercial and trade programs and policies national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates partnership expenses consist of among other things brokerage fees and advisory fees the level of these expenses is dependent upon trading performance and the level of net assets maintained in addition the amount of interest income payable by cgm is dependent upon interest rates over which the partnershipfunds nor cgmmsco have no control no forecast can be made as to the level of redemptions in any given period a limited partner may require the partnership to redeem their redeemable units at the net asset value per redeemable unit as of the last day of any month on three business days notice to the general partner there is no fee charged to

expected performance given market conditions and the objectives of the partnership the general partner continues to monitor the advisors performance on a daily weekly monthly and annual basis to assure these objectives are met commodity markets are highly volatile broad price fluctuations and rapid inflation increase the risks involved in commodity trading but also increase the possibility of profit the profitability of the partnership depends on the existence of major price trends and the ability of certain of the advisors to identify those price trends correctly price trends are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand relationships weather governmental agricultural commercial and trade programs and policies national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates to the extent that market trends exist and the advisors are able to identify them the partnership expects to increase capital through operations in allocating the assets of the partnership among the trading advisors the general partner considers past performance trading style volatility of markets traded and fee requirements the general partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets among the trading advisors and may allocate assets to additional advisors at any time each advisors percentage allocation and trading program is described in the

operationalsettlement risk  the risk of financial and opportunity loss and legal liability attributable to operational problems such as inaccurate pricing of transactions untimely trade execution clearance andor settlement or the inability to process large volumes of transactions the partnershipfunds are subject to increased risks with respect to their trading activities in emerging markets

input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety management has concluded that based on available information in the marketplace the funds level  assets and liabilities are actively traded accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap also requires the need to use judgment in determining if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when the market has become inactive management has concluded that based on available information in the marketplace there has not been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity in the partnerships and the funds level  assets and liabilities the partnership and the funds will separately present purchases sales issuances and settlements in their reconciliation of level  fair value measurements ie to present such items on a gross basis rather than on a net basis and make disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation and the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for measurements that fall within either level  or level  of the fair value hierarchy as required under gaap effective january   the partnership adopted accounting standards update asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs the amendments within this asu changed the wording used to describe many of the gaap requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to eliminate unnecessary wording differences between gaap and ifrs however some of the amendments clarified the financial accounting standards boards the fasb intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and other amendments changed a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements this new guidance did not have a significant impact on the partnerships financial statements the partnership and the funds consider prices for exchangetraded commodity futures forwards and options contracts to be based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level  the values of nonexchangetraded forwards swaps and certain options contracts for which market quotations are not readily available are
