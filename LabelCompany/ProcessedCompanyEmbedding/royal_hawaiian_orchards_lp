management does not believe that the partnership has sufficient working capital to meet current obligations and debt service requirements for at least the next fiscal year as of december   we had approximately  million of cash and  of working capital we have historically funded our operations through cash flows from operations debt and issuance of equity due to a late and smaller harvest and losses in our branded products segment we will be unable to repay our financial obligations due july   from cash flow generated by operations expenses and inventory are being reduced to fund current operations and we plan to issue equity to raise funds to satisfy the debt requirements or extend the terms of the debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds on terms that are acceptable to us or that we will be able to further extend the terms of our debt if we are not able to raise funds through an equity offering or to extend the terms of our debt we may be forced to sell assets to repay maturing debt or discontinue operations our consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern which assumes the continuity of operations the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business although we believe that we will be able to generate sufficient liquidity from the measures described above our current circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue to operate as a going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty our operations we have two business segments orchards and branded products the orchards segment includes our orchard farming and processing operations the branded products segment includes the development manufacture and sale of branded products and the sale of processed kernel our orchards segment derives its revenues from the sale of wis macadamia nuts grown in orchards we own or lease the sale of dis macadamia nuts the sale of macadamia nut kernel to royal revenues from the farming of macadamia orchards owned by other growers and lease income our financial results are principally driven by nut production which is seasonal and highly contingent upon hawaiis climatic conditions and nut prices the macadamia crop year in hawaii runs from july  through june  with nuts generally being harvested from august through april nut production is generally highest during the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year with very low production in the first quarter and little or no production in the second quarter nut production in the first half of the year is the result of pollination and nutset that occurs during april through july or august of the previous year factors such as cool temperatures to promote flower development sunlight adequate moisture and its distribution determine the length of the flowerset season table of contents our branded products segment derives its revenues from the sale of branded macadamia nut products and bulk macadamia nuts substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to introduce a new product or maintain or improve a brands market position promotional allowances such as slotting fees are netted against our revenues therefore an increase in promotional allowances without a resulting increase in sales may decrease our revenues accordingly the future success of the branded products segment depends in large part on our ability to effectively maximize the return on these expenditures to implement our growth strategy of expanding distribution and improving placement of our products and attracting new customers to our brand how we evaluate our business in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to trends in the global and local macadamia nut industries and food manufacturing industry management evaluates the performance of each segment on the basis of operating income and revenue growth in addition we manage our orchards segment based on increased nutinshell productivity farming costs kernel recovery cost stabilization and cash flow generation to support and grow our branded products segment and fund other partnership priorities we manage our branded products segment based on sales including the number of new stores carrying our branded product gross margins and selling expenses the partnership accounts for intersegment sales and transfers at cost plus a markup and such transactions are eliminated in consolidation our branded products segment should enjoy higher growth and has the potential for valueadded innovation and enhanced responsiveness to consumer marketing results of operations consolidated revenues cost of revenues and gross profit for the year ended december   net revenue increased  million or  compared to the year ended  the increase was due to a  million increase in net branded products segment revenue partially offset by a  decrease in orchards revenue orchards revenue on a consolidated basis decreased due to decreased wis nut sales due to lower orchard production for the year ended december   cost of revenues increased  million or  compared to the same period in  due to increased branded products sales offset by lower volume of wis nut sales to external parties for the year ended december   we generated a gross profit of  million and a gross margin of  compared to gross profit of  million and a

royal is recognized after the nuts have been husked dried and shelled for the year ended december   cost of orchards revenue decreased  the  decrease in cost of orchards revenue to  million compared to  million for the same period in  was due to the lower revenue because of lower  production generally our orchards segment receives a higher overall gross margin from sales of kernel as compared to sales of wis nuts based upon agreed upon intersegment sales rates and sales to thirdparty customers operating income decreased  from operating income of  million for the year ended december   to operating income of  for the year ended december   the decrease in operating income was due to lower revenue as a result of lower production and a late start to the harvest we have three longterm agreements with mauna loa expiring in   and  under which all macadamia nuts produced from the iasco orchards which represented approximately  and  of our production in  and  respectively must be sold to and purchased by mauna loa at a predetermined price under the iasco agreements we are paid based on wis pounds at prices that are derived annually from formulas that factor in the mauna loa wholesale price of the highest yeartodate volume fancy and choice products sold in hawaii and the usda national agricultural statistics service nass reported price of wis hawaii macadamia nuts for the period of delivery if the final nass report for the year contains a price or moisture that varies from that used in the formula price calculations for nuts delivered during the year then an adjustment is made between the parties the nass nut price for the crop years ended june   and  was  and  per wis pound respectively in  and  the average price received from mauna loa per wis pound in the crop years ended june   and  amounted to  and  respectively pursuant to the becker property acquisition on june   we assumed five leases which required the lessees of the properties to pay rent to us in the amount of  for the period from acquisition through december   recognized on a straight line basis beginning january   through december   the annual rent is  payable in quarterly installments the lessee is responsible for all costs for the property including real estate taxes and orchard maintenance orchards segment  production and yields production and yield data for the orchards that we own

results on a calendar year basis though the natural crop year generally begins july  our nut production is highly contingent upon hawaiis climatic conditions the macadamia crop year in hawaii runs from july  through june  with nuts generally harvested from august through april nut production is generally highest during the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year with very low production in the first quarter and little or no production in the second quarter nut production in the first half of the year is the result of pollination and fruit set occurring during april through august of the previous year factors such as cool temperatures to promote flower development sunlight and the amount and timing of moisture determine the length of the flower pollination and fruit set season warm evening temperatures in november and december  resulted in a late start to flowering in both the keaau and kau orchards dry weather during the first quarter of  resulted in poor fruit set in the kau orchards the combined result of the late flowering and poor fruit set was that harvest started almost a full month later than normal and  production came in  lower than in  this shortfall was largely from the kau orchards and iasco orchards which in  produced  and  less than  respectively keaau shortfall was less significant  production was  lower than  production table of contents of the approximately  million pounds of production in   million was sold as wis pounds pursuant to the iasco agreements and the remaining amount was sold as wis dis or as kernel to royal in   million was sold as wis pounds pursuant to the iasco agreements and the remaining was sold as dis or kernel to royal orchards segment  costs of orchard revenue agricultural unit costs depend on the operating expenses required to maintain the orchards and to harvest the crop as well as the quantity of nuts actually harvested the partnership has seven contracts to farm macadamia orchards owned by other growers these contracts cover macadamia orchards in the same two locations on the island of hawaii where the partnership owns orchards the farming contracts provide for the partnership to be reimbursed for all direct farming costs ie cultivation irrigation and harvesting to collect a pro rata share of indirect costs and overhead and to charge a management fee or fixed fee the management fee is based on the number of acres farmed or on a percentage of total costs billed revenues from farming services were approximately  million in both  and  our unit costs expressed in dollars per wis pound are calculated by dividing all agricultural costs for each orchard including lease rent property tax tree insurance and depreciation by the number of wis pounds of macadamia nuts produced by that orchard for further information on nut purchase contracts see item   business of the partnership  significant customers  nut sales our unit costs per pound are summarized below cost per wis pound

pound total actual average cost per wis pound all orchards increased from  in  to  in  an increase of  or  the change in cost per wis pound of the individual orchards was primarily due to the lower production in  due to a late fall harvest and a smaller than anticipated crop at the keaau orchard the cost per wis pound increased by  from  in  to  in  or  at the kau orchard without iasco the cost per wis pound increased  from  in  to  in  or  at the iasco orchards the cost per wis pound increased  from  in  to  in  or  this was due to a decrease in annual production at the iasco orchards of  million pounds of wis in  which was primarily due to dry weather resulting in late flowering and poor fruit set and partly due to a late fall harvest branded products segment our branded products

of nutritiously delicious hawaiian islandharvested macadamia nut foods under the royal hawaiian orchards brand today announced the united states food  drug administration fda has approved the company’s petition to claim that consuming macadamia nuts can help reduce the risk of coronary heart disease under certain circumstances the milestone decision follows nearly two years of fda review and marks a significant evolution in the recognition of macadamia nuts as a potentially healthful food which will positively benefit the entire macadamia nut industry coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in men and women in the united states while the fda previously approved a qualified health claim for the consumption of other tree nuts today’s announcement is the first time the agency has extended a qualified health claim to macadamia nuts specifically the following statement may now be applied in connection to the consumption of whole or chopped macadamia nuts including raw blanched roasted salted or unsalted andor lightly coated andor flavored macadamia nuts “supportive but not conclusive research shows that eating  ounces per day of macadamia nuts as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol and not resulting in increased intake of saturated fat or calories may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease” see nutritional information for fat and calorie content “this is a truly a historic day for everyone in the macadamia nut industry” said scott wallace of royal hawaiian macadamia nut “research about the benefits macadamia nuts have for heart health has existed for decades and we’ve worked tirelessly to secure the legal right to share this with the masses many people associate almonds pistachios and walnuts with better health but this momentous decision from the fda now puts macadamia nuts in a similar category we want consumers to know that there is real supportive evidence with respect to the benefits of consuming macadamia nuts consumers are aware of the benefits of consuming other tree nuts like almonds and walnuts and we want them to know similar benefits are available from consuming macadamia nuts royal hawaiian orchards makes a variety of options – from savory roasted nuts to macadamia milks confections and more – that are now widely available so it’s easy to enjoy both the great taste and the benefits of macadamias almost anywhere in the country” macadamia nuts have no cholesterol and are high in monounsaturated fats—the same healthy fats found in olive oil and avocados which are known to help reduce bad cholesterol levels and can lower risk of heart disease and stroke scientists first discovered that adding macadamia nuts to the diet appeared to lower the amount of ldl cholesterol in the blood during the s and s since then researchers have been exploring the connection resulting in a growing body of scientific evidence supporting that a diet including macadamia nuts can help lower ldl cholesterol levels one

state of delaware the partnership is managed by its sole general partner royal hawaiian resources inc the “managing partner” on october   the partnership changed its name from ml macadamia orchards lp to royal hawaiian orchards lp to better enable the partnership to brand its products royal hawaiian was the original brand name used to market the macadamia nuts grown from  until  on the acreage that now comprises our orchards branded product sales are made through the partnership’s wholly owned subsidiary royal hawaiian macadamia nut inc “royal” unless the context otherwise requires royal hawaiian orchards lp and its subsidiaries are referred to in this report as the partnership and “we” “us” or “our”   our principal executive offices are located at  kinoole street suite  hilo hawaii  and our telephone number is   our depositary units representing class a units of limited partnership interests “units” are currently traded on the otcqx platform under the symbol “nnutu”   overview   we are a producer marketer and distributor of highquality macadamia nutbased products we are the largest macadamia nut farmer in hawaii farming approximately  tree acres of orchards that we own or lease in two locations on the island of hawaii including  tree acres that we own and lease to another party we also farm approximately  tree acres of macadamia orchards in hawaii for other orchard owners   in  we established a branded products company to manufacture and sell a line of macadamia snacks under the brand name royal hawaiian orchards® in  we completed construction of the first phase of our drying facility which affords us more control over processing our nuts and reduces our processing costs by the end of fourth quarter of  the second and final phase of our drying plant was completed and the plant became fully operational in january    business segments   we have two business segments orchards and branded products the orchards segment derives its revenues from the sale of wetinshell “wis” macadamia nuts sale of dryinshell “dis” macadamia nuts sale of macadamia nut kernel to royal revenues from contract farming and orchard lease income the branded products segment derives its revenues from the sale of branded macadamia nut products and bulk macadamia nut kernel by royal   information concerning industry segments is set forth in item  – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note  – segment information to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item  of this annual report on form k   orchards segment   the orchards segment grows and farms macadamia nuts for sale wis and dis and for sale of macadamia nut kernel to royal for the processing and sale of branded products and the sale of bulk kernel the orchards segment also provides contract farming services and leases orchards   from  through  and from  through the end of  we sold all of our nut production wis to mauna loa macadamia nut corporation “mauna loa” pursuant to various agreements with mauna loa during  and  we reduced the number of pounds that we sold to mauna loa as of january   only three longterm agreements remain which represented approximately  of our production in both  and    nuts retained by us for use in our branded products segment are dried and then sent to a thirdparty processor for shelling in november  the partnership completed the construction of the first phase of its drying facility located in the ka’u district of the island of hawaii near our producing orchards and we began drying the wis nuts harvested from our orchards not sold to mauna loa   competition demand for macadamia nuts in the united states and hawaii has been strong our nuts are sold to royal and under longterm contracts to mauna loa we compete with other growers in hawaii for labor and for wis nuts to process and sell through royal   macadamia farming we farm approximately  tree acres of orchards that we own or lease including  tree acres that we own and lease to another party we also farm approximately  tree acres of macadamia orchards in hawaii for other orchard owners      table of contents     all orchards are located in two separate regions on the island of hawaii “keaau” and “ka’u” because each region has different terrain and weather conditions farming methods vary somewhat between the regions   branded products segment   in  we commenced marketing branded products under the royal hawaiian orchards® brand name as of december  our branded products were in approximately  grocery natural foods and mass merchant stores nationwide key elements of our branded product strategy are as follows   capitalize on the health benefits of macadamia nuts our strategy is to capitalize on consumers’ views of nuts as a healthy snack that can command prices above traditional massmarketed products according to research conducted by mintel international consumers view fruit and nuts respectively as the number one and two healthiest snacks our products contain no artificial ingredients contain no genetically modified organisms “gmos” are glutenfree and have no sulfites we are leveraging the existing nutritional properties inherent in tree nuts in our line of macadamiabased healthy snacks our strategy is based on promoting the health benefits of macadamia nuts which are similar to those of almonds a food product that has achieved strong market positioning based on growing consumer awareness of associated wellness properties as part of this strategy the partnership sells better for you macadamia snacks under the brand name royal hawaiian orchards®   distribute our products through retailers that target consumers who desire premium healthy snacks we sell our products to national regional and independent grocery and drug store chains as well as mass merchandisers club stores and other retail channels that target consumers with healthy eating habits and the disposable income necessary to afford premium products in accordance with this strategy we seek to secure product placement in mainstream aisles we believe this leads more consumers to purchase our products   mitigate our exposure to fluctuating commodity prices by pursuing a branded product strategy and continuing to farm macadamia nuts we believe that we have a pricing advantage because we are able to produce nuts from our own orchards at a relatively fixed and currently favorable cost and do not have to compete to purchase nuts from third parties furthermore we believe that if wholesale market prices for macadamia nuts decline below our actual production costs we would be better positioned to profitably sell the nuts as branded products thereby mitigating our exposure to fluctuating market prices   use of copackers royal has contracted with thirdparty manufacturers also known as copackers in california minnesota and washington to manufacture the royal hawaiian orchards® branded products utilizing copackers provides us with the flexibility of producing different products and the ability to develop new products quickly and economically we selected our copackers based on production capabilities in producing products of these types   customers royal markets its retail products to wholesale customers directly and through food brokers and to consumers through royal’s ecommerce site the food brokers represent multiple manufacturers and are paid a percentage of sales royal’s customers are national regional and independent grocery and drug store chains as well as mass merchandisers club stores and other retail channels that purchase the products under payment terms approved by royal based on their creditworthiness royal’s customers resell the macadamia nut products to endconsumers in retail outlets in the united states royal also sells bulk kernel to nut brokers and companies who use the kernel in their products   marketing strategy royal’s marketing strategy focuses on building brand awareness for its brand and line of better for you macadamia snacks using social media grassroots marketing such as sampling public relations and participation in community events and festivals we utilize a combination website and integrated ecommerce store at wwwroyalhawaiianorchardscom and sell our products on amazoncom royal also uses facebook and twitter accounts and several other strategies to build its customer base a key marketing strategy is consistent social media presence where royal can connect directly with potential target consumers   product distribution we developed a product distribution network to support sales growth and provide superior customer service in an efficient manner distribution of our products is executed through a thirdparty distribution center we primarily use common carriers to deliver products from these distribution points to our customers   competition the snack food market is highly competitive our products compete against food and snack products sold by many regional and national companies some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than the partnership we believe that additional competitors will enter the markets in which we operate in the macadamia snack food market we are focused on north america where our competitors are the larger macadamia nut companies and private labels we also compete for shelf space of retail grocers convenience stores drug stores mass merchandisers natural food stores and club stores we compete primarily on the basis of product quality ability to satisfy specific consumer needs including glutenfree needs brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to maintain or improve a brand’s market position or to introduce a new product and participants in our industry are engaging with new media including customer outreach through social media and webbased vehicles which require additional staffing and financial resources our principal competitors in the macadamia snack food market are mauna loa mac farms and companies who sell under private labels      table of contents     environmental matters our operations are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations we believe the partnership is in compliance with all material environmental regulations affecting our facilities and operations   research and development we consider research and development of new products to be a significant part of our overall philosophy and we are committed to developing new products that incorporate macadamia nuts as we expand our snack nut product range we believe we can gain greater shelf space in retail stores and increase our market share in  we introduced macadamia nut milk macadamia nut butter and convenient onthego portionsized packages that appeal to healthconscious consumers we believe that our innovations differentiate our products from those of our competitors leading to increased brand loyalty and higher consumer awareness in addition to developing new products we are focused on improving our existing products and are making incremental improvements based on customer feedback   trademarks and patents we market and sell our products primarily under the royal hawaiian orchards® brand which is protected with trademark registration with the us patent and trademark office as well as in various other jurisdictions we expect to continue to maintain this trademark in effect we have no patents   governmental regulations   as an agricultural company we are subject to extensive government regulation including regulation of the manner in which we cultivate and fertilize as well as process our macadamia nuts furthermore the branded products segment of our business subjects us to additional regulation regarding the manufacturing distribution and labeling of our products   manufacturers and marketers of food products are subject to extensive regulation by the food and drug administration “fda” the us department of agriculture “usda” and other national state and local authorities the food drug and cosmetic act and the food safety modernization act and their regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of foods under these acts the fda regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current “good manufacturing practices” regulations imposes ingredient specifications and requirements for many foods requires specialized training and record keeping to identify and prevent hazards within food production facilities and inspects food facilities and issues recalls for tainted food products   food manufacturing facilities and products are also subject to periodic inspection by federal state and local authorities state regulations are not always consistent with federal or other state regulations   seasonality   while sales of our branded products are anticipated to be only slightly seasonal with the fourth quarter of the calendar year somewhat higher macadamia nut production is very seasonal with the largest quantities typically being produced and then inventoried from september through november resulting in large inventories that will be converted into finished product and sold throughout the following year   significant customer   mauna loa has historically been and still is our largest customer wis nut sales to mauna loa represented approximately  of our nut production in  and  in addition in  mauna loa began buying macadamia nut kernel sales of wis nuts and kernel totaled  million in  compared to  million in  and represented  and  of net sales in  and  respectively see item  – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation    employees   as of december   we employed  people  fulltime employees  seasonal employees and five parttime employees of the total  are in farming supervision and management  are in production maintenance and agricultural operations  are in accounting and administration and three are in sales   we are a party to two collective bargaining agreements with the international longshore and warehouse union “ilwu” local  these agreements cover all production maintenance and agricultural employees of the ka’u and keaau orchards on january   we and ilwu local  agreed to two new threeyear contracts which are effective june   through may   although we believe that relationships with our employees and the ilwu are good there is no assurance that we will be able to extend these agreements on terms satisfactory to it when they expire      table of contents     taxation   the partnership has a grandfathered tax status which allows it to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes even though it is publicly traded provided that it pays a  federal tax on gross income from the active conduct of the trade and business of the partnership the partnership will cease to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes if the partnership engages in a substantially new line of business a substantially new line of business conducted through a wholly owned corporate subsidiary of the partnership is not deemed to be a new line of business for tax purposes accordingly the partnership manufactures markets and sells its branded products through its wholly owned corporate subsidiary royal any income or gain the partnership derives from transactions with royal would be included in income or gain of the partnership that would flow through to the unitholders conversely tax losses in royal may not be available to offset the taxable income of the partnership as a result the partnership may have income allocable to unitholders on which the unitholders are obligated to pay taxes yet have no cash available for distribution see item a – risk factors – tax risks of owning our units  our branded products line of business operates through a corporate subsidiary which may result in increased taxes and – your tax liability from the

continues to own its one percent general partnership interest in the partnership and serves as managing partner of the partnership the board of directors and officers of the managing partner remain unchanged prior to the sale of the managing partner the board of directors of the managing partner selfdetermined annually on behalf of the partnership whether any changes should be made to the board of directors the board of directors of the managing partner is now elected annually by crescent river the sale of the managing partner returned the management structure of the partnership to the

additional information concerning the terms of the settlement see item  – legal proceedings    item a  risk factors   our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to significant risks we urge you to consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this form k and our other periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected   risk factors related to our business   we need to obtain financing to repay indebtedness and our current circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue to operate as a going concern    our cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to repay our  bridge loan when due on july   and unless we can extend or refinance our revolving credit facility to repay our revolving credit facility maturing on july   we plan to issue equity to raise funds to satisfy our maturing debt or to extend the terms of our debt however there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise sufficient funds on terms that are acceptable to us or that we will be able to extend the terms of our debt if we are unable to issue sufficient equity extend the terms of our debt or otherwise raise funds in the shortterm management has determined that substantial doubt exists about our ability to maintain our operations as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event we cannot continue in existence we continue to experience net operating losses   we have a substantial amount of indebtedness in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness we will face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations   we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december   we have a total of approximately  million of shortterm indebtedness all of which we will need to refinance or repay in the next few months there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness  on commercially reasonable terms  on terms including with respect to interest rates as favorable as our current debt or  at all if we are unable to refinance or renegotiate our debt we will not be able to repay our  bridge loan due july   and we may not be able to generate enough cash flows from operations to service our remaining debt or to extend or refinance our revolving credit facility although we have maintained renegotiated and extended a revolving credit facility with our current lender and its predecessor for over  years there is no assurance that we will be able to do so given our current financial condition   we rely upon external financing which is secured by a pledge of all of our real and personal property if we are unable to comply with the terms of our loan agreements we could lose our assets   we rely on external financing currently being provided by an amended and restated credit agreement with american agcredit pca “agcredit pca” and a credit agreement with american agcredit flca “agcredit flca” through a revolving credit facility and several term notes these agreements contain various terms and conditions including financial ratios and covenants and are secured by all of the real and personal property of the partnership on multiple occasions during the last several years and as recently as the end of  we have failed to comply with various financial covenants under our credit agreements but have been able to obtain waivers or modifications of the agreements to avoid a default if we are unable to meet the terms and conditions of our credit agreements or to obtain waivers or modifications of such credit agreements we could be in default under our credit agreements and the lenders would be able to accelerate the obligations and foreclose on the collateral securing the indebtedness there is no assurance that we will be able to comply with our credit agreements or obtain waivers or modifications in the future to avoid a default see item   – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources for further information      table of contents     we have a history of losses and our future profitability on a quarterly or annual basis is uncertain which could have a harmful effect on our business and the value of our units   since we launched our branded products in november  and thru the most current period we have not generated enough revenue to exceed our expenditures within any twelvemonth fiscal period we have financed our operations primarily through our cash flow from operations our revolving credit facility and offerings of units as of december   we had debt outstanding of  million of which  million is shortterm including a  million bridge loan maturing on july   if we cannot raise equity or refinance or extend the terms of our debt we will not be able to repay the  bridge loan or our revolving credit facility both of which mature on july   this could force us to sell assets or cease operations   our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to address the needs of our business and to react to changes in our business in addition if we fail to comply with our covenants our debt could be accelerated   as a result of our substantial indebtedness     ● we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic or industry conditions   ● we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund capital investments or other general partnership requirements or to refinance our existing indebtedness   ● we are or will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal or interest on our debt thereby reducing the available cash flows to fund other projects   ● we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry   ● we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt   ● we may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates   ● we may be required to sell some of our assets possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet obligations and   ● we may be limited in our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities including mergers and acquisitions   currently we have credit agreements in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions among other things in addition our credit agreements contain financial covenants our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance if we violate the restrictions in our credit agreements or fail to comply with our applicable financial covenants we will be in default under the agreements which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our longterm indebtedness to be accelerated   royal hawaiian orchards® products were launched in november  and have a limited retail distribution history and thus far our branded products have not been profitable our future ability to grow our revenues and generate profits depends upon continued sellin and sellthrough sales of these new products and increasing efficiencies decreasing costs andor modifying prices related to the manufacture and sale of our products   prior to november  we had never pursued the sale of macadamia nut products to customers or the sale of nuts in kernel form to others for incorporation into their products any adverse developments with respect to the sale of royal hawaiian orchards® macadamia products could significantly reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve profitability and future growth we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to commercialize our macadamia products or that our products will be accepted in retail markets specifically the following factors among others could affect continued market acceptance revenues and profitability of royal hawaiian orchards® snack products     ● the introduction of competitive products into the healthy snack market   ● the level and effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts   ● our ability to effectively manage costs of product development manufacturing inventory transportation and sales   ● any unfavorable publicity regarding nut products or similar products   ● litigation or threats of litigation with respect to these products   ● the price of the product relative to other competing products   ● price increases resulting from rising commodity manufacturing storage and transportation costs   ● regulatory developments affecting the manufacture marketing or use of these products and   ● the inability to gain significant customers   there is no assurance that this effort will be successful or that we will receive a return on our investment      table of contents     we have historically depended on a single nut purchaser   in each of  and  we sold approximately  of our wis nut production to mauna loa in  we also sold kernel to mauna loa totaling  million and together with wis sales representing  of our total net revenue mauna loa is a significant customer and any disruption of the mauna loa relationship could significantly adversely affect us if we are not able to find alternative purchasers of our nut production at comparable prices   we are subject to the risk that market prices of macadamia nuts may not be adequate to cover our costs of production   we have three longterm agreements requiring mauna loa to purchase the nuts from orchards that we purchased from international air service co ltd “iasco” the iasco orchards have historically represented approximately   in  of our nut production these contracts expire in   and  and provide for marketdetermined prices we either use our remaining nuts in our branded products or sell them to willing buyers at market prices we are subject to the risk that world market prices could decline such that we would not be able to sell our nuts at prices that covers our cost of production   a disruption at any of our production facilities would significantly decrease production which could increase our cost of sales and reduce our net sales and income from operations   we plan to dry our nuts at our new drying plant and process and manufacture into products at thirdparty processor and manufacturing facilities a temporary or extended interruption in operations at any of these facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage from fire flood or earthquake infrastructure failures such as power or water shortages raw material shortage or any other reason whether or not covered by insurance could interrupt our process and manufacturing operations disrupt communications with our customers and suppliers and cause us to lose sales and write off inventory any prolonged disruption in the operations of these facilities would have a significant negative impact on our ability to manufacture and package our products on our own and may cause us to seek additional thirdparty arrangements thereby increasing production costs or in the case of our drying facility prevent us from having sufficient nuts for our branded products business these third parties may not be as efficient as we and our current processors and manufacturers are and may not have the capabilities to process and package some of our products which could adversely affect sales or operating income further current and potential customers might not purchase our products if they perceive our lack of alternate manufacturing facilities to be a risk to their continuing source of products   we are dependent on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture all of our products and the loss of a manufacturer or the inability of a manufacturer to fulfill our orders could adversely affect our ability to make timely deliveries of product   we currently rely on and may continue to rely on thirdparty manufacturers to produce all of our branded products if one of these manufacturers were unable or unwilling to produce sufficient quantities of our products in a timely manner or renew contracts with us we would have to identify and qualify new manufacturers and we may be unable to do so due to industry and customer requirements that manufacturers of food products be certified andor audited for compliance with food safety standards the number of qualified manufacturers is constrained as we expand our operations we may have to seek new manufacturers and suppliers or enter into new arrangements with existing ones however only a limited number of manufacturers may have the ability to produce a high volume of our products and it could take a significant period of time to locate and qualify such alternative production sources in addition we may encounter difficulties or be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms as favorable as those that we currently enjoy   there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify and qualify new manufacturers in a timely manner or that such manufacturers could allocate sufficient capacity to meet our requirements which could materially adversely affect our ability to make timely deliveries of product in addition there can be no assurance that the capacity of our current manufacturers will be sufficient to fulfill our orders and any supply shortfall could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations currently some of our products are produced by a single thirdparty source that maintains only one facility the risks of interruption described above are exacerbated with respect to such singlesource singlefacility manufacturer   our manufacturers are required to comply with quality and food production standards the failure of our manufacturers to maintain the quality of our products could adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace and result in product recalls and product liability claims   our manufacturers are required to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our product specifications and requirements for certain certifications for food safety from thirdparty organizations in addition our manufacturers are required to comply with all federal state and local laws with respect to food safety however there can be no assurance that our manufacturers will continue to produce products that are consistent with our standards or in compliance with applicable laws and standards and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify instances in which our manufacturers fail to comply with such standards or applicable laws we would have the same issue with new suppliers the failure of any manufacturer to produce products that conform to applicable standards could materially and adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace and result in product recalls product liability claims and severe economic loss      table of contents     any significant delays of shipments to or from our warehouses could adversely affect our sales   shipments to and from our warehouses could be delayed for a variety of reasons including weather conditions strikes and shipping delays any significant delay in the shipments of product would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and could cause our sales and earnings to fluctuate during a particular period or periods we have from time to time experienced and may in the future experience delays in the production and delivery of product   our farming operations face a competitive labor market in hawaii   our farming operations require a large number of workers many on a seasonal basis the labor market on the island of hawaii is very competitive and most of our employees are unionized under contracts that expire in may  in the event that we are not able to obtain and retain both permanent and seasonal workers to conduct our farming operations or in the event that we are not able to maintain satisfactory relationships with our unionized workers the partnership’s financial results could be negatively impacted   our operations rely on certain key personnel who are critical to our business   our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified management and technical and support personnel we cannot guarantee success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in those positions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees   our farming operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and any failure to comply could result in significant fines or cleanup costs   we use herbicides fertilizers and pesticides some of which may be considered hazardous or toxic substances various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations regulate our properties and farming operations and could make us liable for costs of removing or cleaning up hazardous or toxic substances on under or in property that we currently own or lease that we previously owned or leased or upon which we currently or previously conducted farming operations these laws could impose liabilities without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances the presence of hazardous or toxic substances or the failure to properly clean up such substances when present could jeopardize our ability to use sell or collateralize certain real property and result in significant fines or cleanup costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations future environmental laws could impact our farming operations or increase our cost of revenues   our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations   because we experience seasonal fluctuations in production and thus sales from our orchards our quarterly results fluctuate and our annual performance has depended largely on results from two quarters our business is highly seasonal reflecting the general pattern of peak production and consumer demand for nut products during the months of october november and december historically a substantial portion of our revenues occurred during our third and fourth quarters and we generally experienced lower revenues during our first and second quarters together with losses weather conditions may delay harvesting from december into early january which may result in a fiscal year with lower than normal revenues with the launch of our branded products business wis revenue continues to be highly seasonal while branded products revenue is more evenly distributed throughout the year   our branded products require us to carry additional inventory which increases our working capital needs and our reliance on generating additional income from sales or obtaining additional external financing   although branded products revenues are more evenly distributed throughout the year this change has required us to carry larger quantities of inventory increasing our working capital needs if we are unable to generate additional working capital from product sales or obtain external financing we may not be able to build the inventory necessary to maintain a sufficient and consistent supply of our branded products to meet customer demands which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity financial condition and brand image      table of contents     the price at which we can sell our macadamia nuts may not always exceed our cost of revenues   during  our costs to farm and produce macadamia nuts including depreciation of the trees varied between  cents and  cents per wis pound depending on the orchard or an average of approximately  cents per wis pound and some wis was sold for less than its cost macadamia orchards are required to be cultivated and farmed in order to maintain the trees even in years where the price at which the macadamia nuts could be sold do not cover the cost of revenues in any specific orchard in such event we could suffer losses from certain orchards and our financial performance could be adversely affected there is no assurance that the prices of macadamia nuts in the future will exceed the costs of production   additional regulation could increase our costs of production and our business could be adversely affected   as an agricultural company we are subject to extensive government regulation including regulation of the manner in which we cultivate fertilize and process our macadamia nuts furthermore processing and selling our branded products subject us to additional regulations regarding the manufacturing distribution and labeling of our products there may be changes to the legal or regulatory environment and governmental agencies and jurisdictions where we operate may impose new manufacturing importation processing packaging storage distribution labeling or other restrictions which could increase our costs and affect our financial performance   many of our production costs are not within our control and we may not be able to recover cost increases in the form of price increases from our customers   we purchase water electricity and fuel fertilizer pesticides equipment and other products to conduct our farming operations and produce macadamia nuts transportation costs including fuel and labor also represent a significant portion of the cost of our nuts these costs could fluctuate significantly over time due to factors that may be beyond our control our business and financial performance could be negatively impacted if there are material increases in the costs we incur that are not offset by price increases for the products sold   we are subject to the risk of product liability claims   the production and sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers this risk increases as we move from primarily a farming operation into the marketing and sale of branded products although we believe we have implemented practices and procedures in our operations to promote highquality and safe food products we cannot assure you that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters   diseases and pests can adversely affect nut production   macadamia trees are susceptible to various diseases and pests that can affect the health of the trees and resultant nut production there are several types of fungal diseases that can affect flower and nut development  one of these is phytophthora capsici which affects the macadamia flowers and developing nuts and another botrytis cinerea causes senescence of the macadamia blossom before pollination is completed  these types of fungal disease are generally controllable with fungicides  historically these fungi have infested the reproductive plant parts at orchards located in keaau during periods of persistent inclement weather  tree losses may occur due to a problem known as macadamia quick decline “mqd”  this affliction is caused by phytophthora tropicalis which is associated with high moisture and poor drainage conditions  the keaau orchards are areas with high moisture conditions and may be more susceptible to the mqd problem  afflicted trees in these regions are replaced with cultivars that are intolerant to mqd  the partnership’s keaau orchards experienced tree replacement of  in  and  in      the southern green stink bug causes unattractive stippling to the mature kernels and causes premature drop of young nuts  it has potential to reduce the crop size and quality stink bug damage has historically increased during dry periods as their preferred fabaceous host plants in pasturelands neighboring our orchards succumb to the dry weather and die the stink bugs migrate to the macadamia trees as a secondary host plant losses from stink bug increased to  over the previous year average of  in part due to dry weather from december  to april  two natural enemies a wasp and a fly generally keep nut losses at acceptable levels an insect known as the koa seed worm “ksw” causes fullsized nuts to fall that have not completed kernel development  the tropical nut borer beetle “tnb” bores through the mature macadamia shell and feeds on the kernel  nut damage caused by the tnb is not recorded as a defect by royal hawaiian  however field surveys in  indicate that nut losses attributed to tnb increased to   damages caused by each insect may fluctuate when unfavorable environmental conditions affect the natural enemy populations        table of contents     in march  a foreign insect pest the macadamia felted coccid “mfc” or eriococcus ironsidei was detected on macadamia trees in the south kona area on the island of hawaii  the insect originates from australia where populations are kept under control from native predators and parasites in hawaii however in the absence of its natural enemies mfc has become a serious problem on macadamia nut trees the insect causes defoliation weakening and breakage of large branches and limbs and in severe cases may cause or contribute to tree death  yearly surveys conducted in ka’u have shown mfc to be present extensively throughout the orchards  climatic conditions particularly extremely dry weather are conducive for increased mfc activity  collaboration continued in  with other growers and the state of hawaii to control this pest  at this point in time mfc is not fully understood in particular there is a deficit of information on how mfc is able to cause so much damage to such large trees and what level of production loss is attributed to mfc research is currently being conducted by the university of hawaii to assess the level of crop loss due to mfc  chemical treatments using products approved for use under federal and state laws are being performed throughout our ka’u orchards in   acres were sprayed for mfc in the ka’u orchards the populations are tracked in both treated and untreated areas mfc was detected in our keaau orchard in the spring of   treatment was administered shortly after detection both treated and untreated areas in the keaau orchard continue to be monitored for mfc however due to the expedience of the treatment and the normal high levels of rainfall the mfc population was low in    as indicated above natural enemies are relied upon to manage insects that contribute to nut loss  without these natural enemies greater losses are possible  approved pesticides may be available to manage economically significant insect pests however their use is limited to situations where treatment costs and nut loss justify their use and when their use does not disrupt the natural enemy population   honey bees are placed in the orchards to supplement other insect pollinators during the flowering season  in late  the hawaii department of agriculture identified the varroa mite on feral honey bees near the port of hilo hawaii  this mite is an ectoparasite that attaches to the body of honey bees and weakens them and can result in the destruction of bee hives and colonies  apiaries that place hives in the macadamia nut orchards must manage this pest with miticide in order to maintain healthy bee colonies and avoid the development of resistance to the miticide   increases in these diseases and pests or our inability to successfully control these diseases and pests could result in decreases in production including loss of trees in affected orchards which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   our orchards are susceptible to natural hazards such as wildfires rainstorms floods and windstorms which may adversely affect nut production   our orchards are located in areas on the island of hawaii that are susceptible to natural hazards including drought wildfires heavy rains floods and windstorms  our orchards located in the ka’u region are susceptible to wildfires during periods of drought  in june and july  a wildfire caused widespread damage to agricultural crops in the ka’u region  the fire resulted in damage to irrigation pipes and approximately  tree acres of our macadamia nut orchards  our orchards are also located in areas that are susceptible to storms which produce heavy rainfall  twentyseven major windstorms have occurred on the island of hawaii since  and six of those caused material losses to our orchards in november  the ka’u region was affected by flooding resulting in some nut loss  since the flood in  heavy rain and flooding in the ka’u region has not been as damaging but continue to be potential risks that can affect our nut production  on august   tropical storm iselle made landfall on the island of hawaii with high winds and heavy rain resulting in some tree damage and loss increases in immature nut drop and mature nut loss due to storm runoff  in january  another windstorm swept through the ka’u region and caused a  loss of canopy and trees in our orchards   most of our orchards are surrounded by windbreak trees which provide limited protection  younger trees that have not developed extensive root systems are particularly vulnerable to windstorms  the occurrence of any natural disaster affecting a material portion of our orchards could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   our orchards are subject to risks from active volcanoes   our orchards are located on the island of hawaii where there are two active volcanoes to date no lava flows from either volcano have affected or threatened the orchards but the risk remains   our business may be adversely affected by adverse or unseasonal weather conditions and climate change   poor severe or unusual weather conditions whether caused by climate change or other factors may adversely affect our nut production and our ability to harvest because our nut production is significantly influenced by weather substantial changes to historical weather patterns in hawaii including changing temperature levels changing rainfall patterns and changing storm patterns and intensities could significantly impact our future business financial condition and results of operations      table of contents     the amount and timing of rainfall can materially impact nut production   the productivity of orchards depends in large part on moisture conditions inadequate rainfall can reduce nut yields significantly whereas excessive rain without adequate drainage can foster disease and hamper harvesting operations although rainfall at the orchards located in the keaau region has generally been adequate and at times excessive for the orchards the orchards located in the ka’u area generally receive less rainfall to supplement natural rainfall a portion of the ka’u orchards is presently irrigated irrigation can mitigate some of the effects of a drought but currently it cannot completely supplement the complete needs of the trees and crops the timing of rainfall relative to key development stages in the growing season can impact nut production excessive rains during the flowering season affects pollination and nut set at the keaau orchards where flowering and the rainy season coincide during  the ka’u and keaau areas recorded  and  respectively of the year average rainfall  however the rainfall in ka’u from december  through april  which is a critical flowering and nut development period was recorded as  of the year average and negatively impacted nut set and nut retention for the  crop regardless of the timing lack of or excess of adequate rainfall for prolonged periods of time will also negatively affect nut production   we rely on irrigation water for our ka’u orchards and orchards acquired from iasco if the capacities of those wells diminish or fail we may not have an adequate water supply to irrigate our orchards which could adversely affect our nut production   with the may  acquisition of the farming business we acquired an irrigation well the “sisal well” which supplies water to our orchards in the ka’u region historically the quantity of water available from the sisal well has been generally sufficient to irrigate these orchards in accordance with prudent farming practices the irrigated portion of the ka’u ii orchards is expected to need greater quantities of water as the orchards mature we anticipate that the amount of water available from the sisal well will be generally sufficient assuming average levels of rainfall to irrigate the irrigated orchards in accordance with prudent farming practices for the next several years if the amount of water provided by the sisal well becomes insufficient to irrigate the abovenamed orchards we may need to incur additional costs to increase the capacity of the sisal well drill an alternative well into the historical source that provides water to the sisal well or obtain water from other sources in order to avoid diminished yields   included in the assets we purchased from iasco is an irrigation well the “palima well” that supplies water for the iasco orchards orchards owned by new hawaii macadamia nut co “nhmnc” and trees owned by us on leased land from the state of hawaii under a prior agreement with iasco nhmnc received a portion of the water pumped out of the palima well and we as the new owner of this well are obligated to continue this service the well provides supplemental irrigation and is generally sufficient assuming average levels of rainfall to sustain nut production at historical norms   if insufficient irrigation water is available to the irrigated orchards then diminished yields of macadamia nut production can be expected which could have a material adverse effect on nut production   our insurance may not be sufficient to reimburse us for crop losses   we obtain tree insurance each year under a federally subsidized program the tree insurance for  provides coverage up to a maximum of approximately  million against catastrophic loss of trees due to wind fire or volcanic activity crop insurance was purchased for the  crop season and provides coverage for up to a maximum of approximately   million against loss of nuts due to wind fire volcanic activity earthquake adverse weather wildlife damage and failure of irrigation water supplies there is no assurance that such insurance will cover all losses incurred by the partnership or that such insurance will be available or purchased in the same amount in future periods   fluctuations in various food and supply costs as well as increased costs associated with product processing and transportation could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results   both we and our manufacturers obtain some of the key ingredients used in our products from thirdparty suppliers as with most food products the availability and cost of raw materials used in our products can be significantly affected by a number of factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions growing decisions government programs including government programs and mandates relating to ethanol weather conditions such as frosts drought and floods and plant diseases pests and other acts of nature because we do not control the production of raw materials we are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production of raw materials based on conditions not within our control such conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers weather crop conditions transportation interruptions natural disasters sustainability issues and boycotts of products or other catastrophic events   there can be no assurance that we or our manufacturers will be able to obtain alternative sources of raw materials at favorable prices or at all should there be shortages or other unfavorable conditions in some instances we enter into forward purchase commitments to secure the costs of projected commodity requirements needed to produce our finished goods these commitments are stated at a firm price or as a discount or premium from a future commodity price and are placed with our manufacturers or directly with ingredient or packaging suppliers there can be no assurance that our pricing commitments will result in the lowest available cost for the commodities used in our products our key raw material is macadamia nuts we currently obtain the macadamia nuts for our products solely from our production in hawaii the inability to obtain macadamia nuts due to poor weather or for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business in addition energy is required to process and produce our products transportation costs including fuel and labor also impact the cost of manufacturing our products these costs fluctuate significantly over time due to factors that may be beyond our control      table of contents     our inability or our manufacturers’ inabilities to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for our products or energy at favorable prices or at all as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could cause an increase in our cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross margin or cause our sales and earnings to fluctuate from period to period such fluctuations and decrease in gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions there is no assurance that we would be able to pass along any cost increases to our customers in the form of price increases   our advertising is subject to regulation by the federal trade commission under the federal trade commission act which prohibits dissemination of false or misleading advertising   the national advertising division of the council of better business bureaus inc “nad” administers a selfregulatory program of the advertising industry to ensure truth and accuracy in national advertising nad monitors national advertising and entertains inquiries and challenges from competing companies and consumers should our advertising be determined to be false or misleading we may have to pay damages withdraw our campaign and possibly face fines or sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results   adverse publicity or consumer concern regarding the safety and quality of food products or health concerns whether with our products or for food products in the same food group as our products may result in the loss of sales   we are highly dependent upon consumers’ perception of the safety quality and possible dietary benefits of our products as a result substantial negative publicity concerning one or more of our products or other foods similar to or in the same food group as our products could lead to a loss of consumer confidence in our products removal of our products from retailers’ shelves and reduced prices and sales of our products product quality contamination or safety issues actual or perceived or allegations of product contamination even when false or unfounded could hurt the image of our brands and cause consumers to choose other products furthermore any product recall whether our own or by a third party within one of our categories or due to real or unfounded allegations could damage our brand image and reputation by way of example there have been recent recalls of pistachio and macadamia nuts produced by third parties due to salmonella contamination while we roast all of the nuts in our branded products to limit the risk of bacterial contamination and our purchasers of bulk kernel are expected to roast the nuts prior to sale we cannot assure you that roasting will be conducted sufficiently or will prevent all instances of contamination that our processors copackers and distributors will comply with our specifications or that every purchaser of our nuts in bulk will in fact roast and properly handle the nuts prior to sale any of these events could subject us to significant liability and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we conduct operations in a market segment that suffers a loss in consumer confidence as to the safety and quality of food products our business could be materially adversely affected the food industry has recently been subject to negative publicity concerning the health implications of gmos obesity trans fat diacetyl artificial growth hormones arsenic in rice and bacterial contamination such as salmonella and aflatoxins consumers may increasingly require that foods meet stricter standards than are required by applicable governmental agencies thereby increasing the cost of manufacturing such foods and ingredients developments in any of these areas including but not limited to a negative perception about our formulations could cause our operating results to differ materially from expected results any of these events could harm our sales increase our costs and hurt our operating results perhaps significantly   we may experience increased competition for raw materials and from other producers of food products if the trend for nongmo products continues as well as increased regulation of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business   our products contain only nongmo ingredients the food industry has been experiencing a significant trend in which an increasing number of consumers are requiring only nongmo ingredients in their foods legislation could require companies to move to nongmo labeling or ingredients such industry trends or legislation could result in changes to our labeling advertising or packaging as additional retailers require or consider requiring all of their products to be nongmo we may face increased competition for sources of raw materials that are nongmo such industry pressure may be particularly problematic in the united states where most farmers produce genetically modified foods making it difficult to source nongmo ingredients and raw materials there is also a risk of contamination of nongmo farms by neighboring gmo farms although the trend toward nongmo products could be positive for our sales an increase in competition and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations   as our business increases in size we will need to locate and contract qualified copackers with sufficient dedicated space for our nongmo glutenfree products and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so   we rely on a single copacker for certain products if demand for glutenfree products grows we will need to increase our production through additional copackers to ensure that we have sufficient supply to meet increasing demand there is no assurance that we will be able to find available qualified copackers or that we will be able to negotiate contracts with them on commercially reasonable terms or at all      table of contents     our business operations are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our operations   manufacturers and marketers of food products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda the usda and other national state and local authorities for example the food drug and cosmetic act and the new food safety modernization act and their regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of foods under these acts the fda regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current “good manufacturing practices” regulations imposes ingredient specifications and requirements for many foods inspects food facilities and issues recalls for tainted food products additionally the usda has adopted regulations with respect to a national organic labeling and certification program   food manufacturing facilities and products are also subject to periodic inspection by federal state and local authorities state regulations are not always consistent with federal regulations or other state regulations   any changes in laws and regulations applicable to food products could increase the cost of developing and distributing our products and otherwise increase the cost of conducting our business any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations including future laws and regulations we may be subject to civil liability including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity   we may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any food products manufactured or marketed by us cause injury illness or death   regardless of whether such claims against us are valid they may be expensive to defend and may generate negative publicity both of which could materially adversely affect our operating results the sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of bacterial contamination foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during production processes although we believe that we and our manufacturers are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations if the consumption of our products causes or is alleged to have caused an illness in the future we may become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding an illness injury or death could materially adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers on a permanent basis as well as our corporate image and operating results moreover claims or liabilities of this nature might not be covered by insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have although we have product liability insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be adequate we cannot be sure that claims or liabilities will be asserted for which adequate insurance will be available or that such claims or liabilities will not exceed the available amount of insurance coverage our food products may also experience product tampering contamination or spoilage or be mishandled or mislabeled or otherwise damaged under certain circumstances a product recall could be initiated leading to a material adverse effect on our reputation operations and operating results recalls may be required to avoid seizures or civil or criminal litigation or due to market demands even if such a situation does not necessitate a recall product liability claims could be asserted against us a product liability judgment or a product recall involving us or a third party within one of our categories could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity and could impair the perception of our brand for an extended period of time even if we have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification product liabilities relating to defective products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity financial condition and brand image   the food industry has been subject to a growing number of claims including class action lawsuits based on the nutritional content of food products and on disclosure and advertising practices we may face these types of claims and proceedings and even if we are successful in defending these claims publicity about these matters may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results in addition suits against our competitors can harm our business these types of class action lawsuits can also make it more difficult for us to market our products by restricting our ability to differentiate the functional food aspects of our products from other products on the market furthermore the defense of class action lawsuits can result in significant costs which are oftentimes not covered by insurance can be timeconsuming and can divert the attention of management from other matters relating to our business   the food industry is highly competitive and we compete with many companies that have greater resources than we do   numerous multinational regional and local firms currently compete or are capable of competing with us our products compete with branded products as well as generic and privatelabel products of food retailers wholesalers and cooperatives we compete primarily on the basis of product quality ability to satisfy specific consumer needs including glutenfree needs brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price some competitors may have different profit or strategic objectives than we do some competitors may invest in discounts or trade credit at a time when we are investing in new packaging and promotion or vice versa competitors may develop new patentable technology that results in products which are able to compete successfully with our products substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to maintain or improve a brand’s market position or to introduce a new product and participants in our industry are engaging with new media including customer outreach through social media and webbased vehicles which require additional staffing and financial resources      table of contents     our largest principal competitors in the macadamia snack food market are mauna loa mac farms and companies who sell under private labels we also compete with nonmacadamia nut snack food products including snack products marketed by large national companies which have substantially greater market presence a longer operating history better distribution and greater financial marketing capital and other resources than us our ability to gain or maintain market share may be limited as a result of actions by competitors or by the limited advertising and promotional resources available to us   successful new product introductions are important to growing our business and there is no guarantee that buyers will accept our products for their stores or set reasonable prices for our products   even when stores accept our products we still must expend resources to create consumer awareness and generate interest in our products in addition competitors may offer significant price reductions and we cannot ensure that consumers will find our products suitably differentiated from products of our competitors   the food industry and retailers in the grocery industry use new products as a way of creating excitement and variety of choices to attract consumers there is a risk that we will be unable to develop new product technologies to address consumer demands even if we identify new innovations the cost may be prohibitive the products’ taste may not meet customer standards there may be high introductory costs we may have limited financial resources available for new product launches there may be regulatory restrictions on the production and advertising of our new products and our new products may take away sales from our other products in addition underperformance on new product launches can damage overall brand credibility with customers   our ability to develop market and sell new products at an appropriate price may be hampered by the inability to get shelf space for our products at a reasonable cost or once placed to have an attractive price set for our products competitors many of whom have greater resources than us vie for the same shelf placement and may offer incentives to the retailers that we cannot match in addition unattractive shelf placement and pricing may put us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors   furthermore there is a trend among retailers in the grocery industry to reduce the overall number of products offered in their stores further increasing competition for shelf space and making it more difficult for us to keep existing products on the shelf and introduce new products with these retailers even if we do obtain shelf placement our products may fail to achieve the sales expectations held or set by our retailers potentially causing these retailers to remove our products from the shelf as companies face more pressure for shelf space within each category the increase in the number and quality of privatelabel products continues to affect branded products   we may need to increase our marketing and advertising spending to obtain and keep shelf placement for our products create consumer awareness protect and grow our existing market share or promote new products any of which could impact our operating results the inability to stay current with healthy snack food trends through new products could materially adversely affect our business performance   the consolidation of retail customers could adversely affect us   retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors continue to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business consolidation also produces larger more sophisticated retail customers that can resist price increases and demand lower pricing more promotional programs or specifically tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands further retail consolidation and increasing retail bargaining power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations   if we need to compete with other manufacturers or with retailer brands on the basis of price our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted   our branded products face competition from private label products that at times may be sold at lower price points the impact of price gaps between our products and privatelabel products may result in share erosion and harm our business a number of our competitors have broader product lines substantially greater financial and other resources andor lower fixed costs than we have our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products that are more attractive to customers or consumers than ours are these competitors may also prove to be more successful in marketing and selling product than we are and may be better able to increase prices to reflect cost pressures we may not compete successfully with these other companies or maintain or grow the distribution of our products we cannot predict the pricing commodity costs or promotional activities of our competitors or whether they will have a negative effect on us many of our competitors engage in aggressive pricing and promotional activities there are competitive pressures and other factors which could cause our products to lose market share a decline in sales or result in significant price or margin erosion which would have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations      table of contents     we have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which if not remediated could have resulted in material misstatements in our financial statements additional material weaknesses could arise in the future   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in rule af under the exchange act a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis   during the first quarter of  we concluded that certain material weaknesses existed as of december   specifically management identified control deficiencies that constitute individually or in the aggregate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to our account reconciliation process and inadequate segregation of duties   as of june   the following measures among others had been implemented to address the material weaknesses identified as of december       ● we hired two new accounting staff members in order to achieve an effective control environment   ● we hired a controller to fill the vacancy resulting from the departure of our previous controller and   ● we changed our principal financial and accounting officer to a person with greater accounting and financial experience and expertise   as a result of these actions management concluded that the previously identified material weaknesses were remedied at june   although management concluded that the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have been remediated we expect to continue implementing measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting including upgrading our financial accounting systems and recruiting further accounting andor finance staff as necessary in order to maintain an effective control environment   we cannot assure that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future   significant influence over the partnership’s affairs may be exercised by certain holders of units one couple controls over  ⅔   of the units and owns a controlling interest in the managing partner which gives them the ability to control or block significant transactions by the partnership   as of march   the holders of units holding more than  of our units were fred and mary wilkie ebrahimi with approximately  beneficial ownership and barry w blank with approximately  beneficial ownership the ebrahimis have the ability to control or block approvals that may be sought from holders of units including mergers sales of substantial assets and modifications to the partnership agreement which generally require approval by holders of a majority of the units the ebrahimis also own a controlling interest in the sole shareholder of the managing partner on june   the partnership sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the managing partner to crescent river a company controlled by the ebrahimis effectively giving the ebrahimis control of the partnership   effective october   bradford c nelson was elected as a director of the partnership and on may   he was elected president principal financial officer principal accounting officer and secretary of the partnership mr nelson is the president and owner of west sedge inc which provides finance and management services to businesses and family offices including companies owned by the ebrahimi family and companies owned by mr fred ebrahimi effective december  barry w blank was elected as a director of the managing partner there is no affiliation between the ebrahimis and mr blank it is possible that the interests of the ebrahimis or mr blank could conflict with the interests of the other holders of units   the significant holdings of units by the principal holders may adversely impact the market price of our units and deter bids to acquire the partnership   the significant concentration of unit holdings may deter persons desiring to make bids to acquire the partnership because they may not be able to do so without the cooperation of the principal holders of units in addition if the principal holders or other large holders of units were to sell a large number of the partnership’s units the market price of our units could decline significantly furthermore the perception in the public market that the principal holders or other large holders of units might sell their units could depress the market price of our units regardless of their actual plans      table of contents     holders of units have limited voting rights and the managing partner cannot be changed unless our largest unitholder votes in favor of the change   holders of units have limited voting rights on matters affecting the partnership’s business which may have a negative effect on the price at which the units trade in particular the holders of units do not elect the directors of the managing partner furthermore if holders of units are not satisfied with the performance of the directors they may find it difficult to remove any or all of the directors because the partnership agreement requires a vote of at least   ⅔ of the outstanding units to remove the managing partner no change of the managing partner can be effected unless the ebrahimis vote their units in favor of the change   ownership of the partnership’s units is different from ownership of stock and unlike stockholders holders of our units do not have the right to elect directors of our managing partner   although many of the business risks to which we are subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation engaged in a similar business limited partnership interests are inherently different from the capital stock of a corporation the units represent limited partnership interests the rights of a unitholder differ substantially from rights of a stockholder in many important respects in particular management of the partnership is except for certain specific matters requiring approval of unitholders vested in the managing partner although holders of   ⅔ of the units have the power to remove and replace the managing partner unitholders do not have the power to vote upon the composition of the managing partner’s board of directors in addition since the ebrahimis control approximately  of our units the managing partner cannot be changed unless the ebrahimis vote their units in favor of the change moreover the right of unitholders to participate in governance of the partnership through exercise of voting rights is limited to certain specified matters   our units are not listed on a national securities exchange which may make it more difficult to buy and sell units and subjects us to fewer regulations than exchangetraded companies are subject to   our units are currently traded on the otcqx which is an overthecounter securities market under the symbol “nnutu” the fact that our units are not listed on a national securities exchange is likely to make trading such units more difficult for brokerdealers holders of units and investors in addition it may limit the number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in our units which may have an adverse effect on the price of our units it may also make it more difficult for the partnership to raise capital in the future in addition because our units are traded on the otcqx we are subject to fewer rules and regulations than if the units were traded on nasdaq stock market or another national securities exchange   new potential accounting rules related to leases may adversely affect our financial statements and create difficulty in meeting loan covenants   in february  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu”  “leases” the new standard establishes a rightofuse “rou” model that requires a lessee to record a rou asset the lessee’s right to use the leased asset and a liability the future rent payment obligations on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than  months currently all of our orchard land leases are accounted for as operating leases with no related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   the partnership is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of asu  on its consolidated financial statement but these changes could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance   we may need to renegotiate certain contracts such as debt agreements to address the impact on debt covenants of reporting lease liabilities on the balance sheet for instance the balance sheet reporting may affect our net worth and we may not be able to meet the minimum tangible net worth requirement as originally provided for under our present debt agreements with agcredit pca and agcredit flca we will also need to ensure that our systems are capable of processing the required information to satisfy the proposed requirements   in may  the fasb issued asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic ” the new guidance provides new criteria for recognizing revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the partnership expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the new guidance requires expanded disclosures to provide greater insight into both revenue that has been recognized and revenue that is expected to be recognized in the future from existing contracts quantitative and qualitative information will be provided about the significant judgments and changes in those judgments that management made to determine the revenue which is recorded in august  the fasb issued asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  deferral of the effective date” this update deferred the effective date for implementation of this standard by one year asu  is now effective for annual periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that period the partnership anticipates adopting this guidance in the first quarter of  and is evaluating the impact of adoption of the new rules on the partnership’s consolidated financial statements      table of contents     unauthorized access to confidential information and data on our information technology systems and security and data breaches could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results   as part of our operations we rely on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions communicate with our suppliers and other third parties and on continued and unimpeded access to secure network connections to use our computer systems we have physical technical and procedural safeguards in place that are designed to protect information and protect against security and data breaches as well as fraudulent transactions and other activities despite these safeguards and our other security processes and protections we cannot be assured that all of our systems and processes are free from vulnerability to security breaches through cyberattacks which are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated physical breach or other means or inadvertent data disclosure by third parties or by us a significant data security breach including misappropriation of customer distributor or employee confidential information could cause us to incur significant costs which may include potential costs of investigations legal forensic and consulting fees and expenses costs and diversion of management attention required for investigation remediation and litigation substantial repair or replacement costs we could also experience data losses that would impair our ability to manage inventories or process transactions and a negative impact on our reputation and loss of confidence of our customers distributors suppliers and others any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results   tax risks of owning our units   any tax benefits of investment in our units are not certain   the anticipated aftertax benefit of an investment in our units depends largely on the treatment of the partnership as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes as well on as the partnership not being subject to a material amount of entitylevel taxation by individual states if the partnership were to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes or become subject to additional amounts of entitylevel taxation for state tax purposes then the partnership’s cash available for distribution to holders of units could materially decline   our branded products line of business operates through a corporate subsidiary which may result in increased taxes   our branded products line of business is conducted through royal a wholly owned separate taxable corporation so that the partnership will not be considered to be engaging in a substantial new line of business that would terminate its status as an electing  partnership as defined by the internal revenue code of  as amended “code” the partnership’s transactions with royal may be subject to federal state or local taxes and any income or gain that the partnership derives from those transactions would be included in the partnership’s income or gain that flows through to a holder of units in addition distributions that the partnership receives from royal will be taxable dividends to the extent of royal’s earnings and profits conversely losses that may be incurred by the partnership as a result of transactions with royal may be subject to deferral or disallowance and tax losses in royal may not be available to offset the taxable income of the partnership because royal is subject to federal and state income tax royal’s income available for distribution will be reduced by those taxes the partnership has recorded a valuation allowance equal to  of royal’s deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty regarding future realization of royal’s net operating loss carry forwards “nols”   your tax liability from the ownership of units may exceed your distributions from the partnership   the tax liability of holders of units with respect to their units could exceed their distributions from the partnership with respect to units holders of units will generally be treated as partners to whom the partnership will allocate taxable income which can differ in amount from the cash distributed to holders of units unitholders will be required to include their allocable share of the partnership’s income in gross income for us federal income tax purposes and in some cases for state and local income tax purposes and to pay any taxes due thereon even if they have not received a cash distribution from the partnership for their allocable share of partnership income   tax gain or loss on the disposition of units could be more or less than expected   a holder of units who disposes of units will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the tax basis of such units because distributions in excess of a units holder’s allocable share of the partnership’s net taxable income decrease the tax basis of the holder’s units the amount if any of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units disposed of will in effect become taxable income if the units are sold at a price greater than the tax basis of the holder of units even if the price received is less than the holder’s original cost   you will bear the tax liability on any income allocable to you   the book and tax treatment of the units has changed over the years and at this time for tax purposes a holder of units will experience higher earnings or lower loss compared to the income determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” furthermore given our current financial condition and the restrictions on distributions under our current credit agreements holders of units should not expect to receive any distributions with respect to their units and thus will bear the tax liability on any income allocable to them      table of contents     you may become subject to state and local taxes with respect to the partnership’s activities   a holder of units may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in the states where the partnership owns property or conducts business   the internal revenue service “irs” may contest our tax positions which could change the aftertax value of your investment   the irs may disagree with the tax positions that we take we may need to undertake administrative or judicial proceedings to defend our tax positions the holders of units will indirectly bear the costs of any such contest we may not prevail in a tax contest the existence of a tax contest may adversely affect the market for units an adverse ruling by the irs could change the aftertax value of your investment   the partnership may lose its status as an electing  partnership taxable as a partnership which could result in a substantial reduction in the value of the units   the partnership would be taxable as a corporation but for its status as an electing  partnership which allows the partnership to be taxed as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes if the partnership were to lose its status as an electing  partnership and otherwise not qualify to be treated as a partnership under the publicly traded partnership rules the partnership would be taxed as a corporation and subject to us federal and state taxation at the partnership level distributions to unitholders would be treated either as a taxable dividend of current and accumulated earnings and profits or in the absence of earnings and profits as a nontaxable return of capital or taxable capital gain thus taxation as a corporation would likely result in a material reduction of cash flow and aftertax return to holders of units and thus would likely result in a substantial reduction in the value of the units   if the irs contests the federal income tax positions we take the market for our units may be adversely impacted the cost of any irs contest will likely reduce cash available for distribution and if adjustments to income are required holders may be required to amend their tax returns and pay interest and penalties on any additional tax resulting from such adjustments   if the irs challenges a tax position that we adopt it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to defend the allocations any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our units and the price at which they trade the cost of defending the allocations will increase the partnership’s expenses and will likely reduce the cash available for distribution in addition if an adjustment is required holders of units may be required to amend their income tax returns for the years in question and pay interest and penalties on any additional tax resulting from the adjustment   recently enacted legislation alters the procedures for assessing and collecting taxes due for taxable years beginning after december   in a manner that could substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to unitholders   recently enacted legislation applicable to the partnership for taxable years beginning after december   alters the procedures for auditing large partnerships and also alters the procedures for assessing and collecting taxes due including applicable penalties and interest as a result of an audit under the new rules unless we are eligible to and do elect to issue revised schedules k to our unitholders with respect to an audited and adjusted return the irs may assess and collect taxes including any applicable penalties and interest directly from the partnership in the year in which the audit is completed such tax liability will be determined without regard to unitholderlevel tax items that could otherwise reduce tax due on any adjustments if we are required to pay taxes penalties and interest as a result of audit adjustments cash available for distribution to our unitholders may be substantially reduced in addition because payment would be due for the taxable year in which the audit is completed unitholders during that taxable year would bear the expense of the adjustment even if they were not unitholders during the audited taxable year if permitted under future guidance from the irs the partnership might elect to have the assessment made against the unitholders in the year under review in which event each unitholder would be required to take into account such adjustment at the their level and pay additional tax for the current year   the partnership’s allocations of profits and losses may not be respected by the irs which could result in changes to income allocation requiring holders to amend their tax returns and pay interest and penalties on any additional tax resulting from such adjustments   we intend to allocate profits and losses in a manner consistent with the requirements of the code however the irs rules that govern the allocations of profits and losses particularly with respect to allocations to be made to maintain the uniformity of units to account for differences between the book and tax capital accounts of unitholders to account for the purchase of units through the exercise of subscription rights and to account for varying prices paid by unitholders to purchase their units are complex and uncertain and there is no assurance that the irs will respect the allocation methods utilized by the managing partner if there is an irs challenge we will likely incur administrative costs to defend the allocations the cost of defending the allocations will increase our expenses will likely reduce the cash available for distribution and may reduce the value of the units in addition if an adjustment is required unitholders may be required to amend their income tax returns for the years in question and pay interest and penalties on any additional tax resulting from the adjustment if the irs were to make adjustments to allocations in an audit of the partnership for a taxable year commencing after december   the partnership itself could incur tax liability as a result of such audit adjustments      table of contents     the irs may challenge our treatment of each purchaser of our units as having the same tax treatment without regard to the actual units purchased which could result in audit adjustments to holders of units   in order to maintain the uniformity of our units so that they can be publicly traded and because we are unable to match transferors and transferees of units we have adopted certain depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform in all respects to treasury regulations a successful irs challenge of these positions could adversely affect the amount or timing of tax benefits available to holders of units and could adversely affect the value of our units or result in audit adjustments to holders of units   the irs may challenge our allocation of items of income gain loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units which could change the allocation of such items among owners of units   we generally prorate our items of income gain loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units based upon the ownership of our units on the first business day of each month our allocation methods may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations and could be challenged by the irs our counsel is unable to opine as to the validity of our allocation methods in the absence of treasury regulations or other guidance that approve of our allocation methods if the irs were to successfully challenge our proration method the allocations of items of income gain loss and deductions among holders of units may be changed   a holder of units whose units are the subject of a securities loan eg a loan to a “short seller” to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition   a holder of units whose units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units in that case such holder may no longer be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a partner in the partnership with respect to those units during the period of such loan and the may recognize gain or loss from such disposition moreover during the period of the loan any of our income gain loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by such holder and any cash distributions received by the holder as to those units could be taxable as ordinary income holders of units desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller should modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units   taxexempt entities and nonus persons face tax issues from owning units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them   the investment in units by taxexempt entities such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts “iras” and nonus persons raises issues unique to such investors for example virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from us federal income tax including iras and other retirement plans is unrelated business taxable income and is taxable to them distributions to nonus persons are reduced by withholding taxes and nonus persons are required to file us federal tax returns and pay tax on their shares of our taxable income   item b unresolved staff comments   none   item   properties   orchards segment   location the partnership owns or leases approximately  tree acres of macadamia orchards on the island of hawaii the orchards are located in two areas ka’u and keaau the ka’u area is located in the south part of the island about  miles from hilo and the keaau area is located six miles south of hilo on the east side of the island      table of contents     click to enlarge     the majority of macadamia nut trees grown in the state of hawaii are grown on the island of hawaii in volcanic soil that permits drainage during heavy rainfall while the orchards are located within an approximately mile radius the climate and other conditions that affect the growing of macadamia nuts are different these differences are the result of prevailing wind patterns and island topography which produce a variety of microclimates throughout the island   age and density the productivity of macadamia nut orchards depends on several factors including among others the age of the trees the number of trees planted per acre soil condition climate rainfall andor irrigation assuming adequate moisture the most significant characteristic affecting yields is maturity the trees in a macadamia nut orchard generally begin to produce nuts at a commercially acceptable level at around nine years of age thereafter nut yields increase gradually until the trees reach maturity at approximately  years of age after which the nut yield remains relatively constant except for variances produced by rainfall cultivation practices pest infestation and disease of the  tree acres of macadamia orchards owned or leased by the partnership  are over  years of age up to  of trees are lost to various causes each year and management determines when and whether to replace such trees   rainfall macadamia trees grow best in climates with substantial and evenly distributed rainfall or equivalent irrigation and in soil that provides good drainage inadequate rainfall can significantly reduce nut yields while excessive rain without adequate drainage can impede healthy tree growth promote the growth of harmful fungal diseases and produce mud holes that require repair of the orchard floor   at keaau normal rainfall is adequate without irrigation and the volcanic soil provides good drainage however short droughts and occasional flooding have occurred in the event of a very long drought production at keaau might be affected at ka’u located on the drier side of the island the rainfall averages are substantially less than those at keaau particularly at the lower elevations approximately  acres at the lower elevations of ka’u are irrigated from the sisal well which provides additional water when required the palima well provides irrigation for approximately  tree acres of iasco orchards under extremely dry conditions at ka’u such as a prolonged drought irrigation is not sufficient and production and quality will be adversely affected      table of contents     orchards the following table lists each

edmund c olson as trustee of the edmund c olson trust no  vs royal hawaiian orchards lp circuit court of the third circuit state of hawaii civil no  filed on january   in which the olsen trust sought a declaratory judgment that we had breached the terms of two leases the “greenshoe i and greenshoe ii leases” on which  tree acres of macadamia nut orchards are situated the olson trust claimed that by failing to exercise “good husbandry” and permitting waste of the orchards through its horticultural practices the olson trust is entitled to terminate the leases and reenter and expel us from the orchards   pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement each of the greenshoe i and ii leases as well as a third lease between the parties not in dispute the “ka’u orchard  lease” and collectively with the greenshoe i and ii leases the “leases” will be terminated in conjunction with the termination of the leases the olson trust will convey all of its interests in the land and

results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties the forwardlooking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations estimates assumptions and projections about our industry business and future financial results our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those discussed under part i item a – risk factors and other sections in this report   management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore management’s determination of estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities requires the exercise of judgment in the selection and application of assumptions based on various factors including historical experience current and expected economic conditions and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances we routinely evaluate our estimates including those related to sales customer returns allowances for doubtful accounts inventory valuations useful lives of fixed assets and related impairment longterm investments goodwill and intangible asset valuations and impairments income taxes contingencies and litigation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions      table of contents     summary   royal hawaiian orchards lp is a producer marketer and distributor of highquality macadamia nutbased products we are the largest macadamia nut farmer in hawaii farming approximately  tree acres of orchards that we own or lease in two locations on the island of hawaii including  tree acres that we own and lease to another party we also farm approximately  tree acres of macadamia orchards in hawaii for other orchard owners   the partnership was formed in  as a master limited partnership in  we established a branded products company to manufacture and sell a line of macadamia snacks under the brand name royal hawaiian orchards® in  in an effort to gain more control over processing our nuts and reduce our processing costs we completed construction of the first phase of our drying facility the second and final phase of our drying plant was completed in the fourth quarter of  and became fully operational in january    our macadamia snacks contain no artificial ingredients contain no genetically modified organisms are glutenfree and have no sulfites we sell our products to national regional and independent grocery and drug store chains as well as mass merchandisers club stores and other retail channels that target consumers with healthy eating habits and disposable income necessary to afford premium products we estimate that as of december   we had products in approximately  retail stores in the united states   in  we launched several new products we made our first entry into the chocolate category offering a line of dark chocolatecovered macadamias with antioxidant fruits acai goji and pomegranate we further expanded our product offerings by introducing fiveounce bags of natural macadamia nuts and ounce bags of roasted salted macadamia nuts and blueberry pomegranate macadamia nuts in club stores in  we launched macadamia nut milk macadamia nut butter and “grab  go pouches” which are single serve  ounce pouches   recent developments   on june   the partnership sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the managing partner to crescent river for    the only asset of the managing partner consists of a  general partnership interest in the partnership the general partnership interest is unregistered and nontransferrable pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement the managing partner is also entitled to an annual management fee equal to  of operating cash flow as defined by the partnership agreement and an incentive fee if net cash flow of the partnership exceeds certain levels defined in the partnership agreement the management fee has been waived by the managing partner since it became a wholly owned subsidiary of the partnership in  the incentive fee has not been earned by the managing partner for at least  years as part of the transaction the managing partner agreed to waive both the management fee and the incentive fee for fiscal   and  after  the managing partner will be eligible to earn the management fee and the incentive fee pursuant to the partnership agreement the partnership is still required to reimburse the managing partner for expenses incurred in managing the partnership   subsequent events   credit agreement with agcredit pca   on january   we entered into the sixth amendment to amended and restated credit agreement and waiver “sixth pca credit agreement amendment” with our existing lender agcredit pca capitalized terms used below related to our credit agreements are defined under the heading “ debt ” below   as a result the amended pca credit agreement was amended as follows     ● the maturity date of the  bridge loan was extended from january   to july     ● the maturity date of the revolving credit facility was extended from march   to july     ● the interest rate on the  bridge loan will increase as of april   from a libor plus  or the base rate plus  to b libor plus  or the base rate plus  the partnership elected to borrow at the base rate and   ● the minimum consolidated ebitda was reduced for the fourquarter period ending march   and for the fourquarter period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter from  to    in addition a onetime waiver was granted in connection with events of default as defined in the amended pca credit agreement relating to i the consolidated ebitda covenant of the amended pca credit agreement for the fourquarter period ended december   and ii the crossdefault covenant of the amended pca credit agreement relating to the event of default in the flca credit agreement      table of contents     credit agreement with american agcredit flca   on january   we also executed the second flca credit agreement amendment with our existing lender agcredit flca   as a result the flca credit agreement was amended by eliminating the total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio covenant as of the last day of the calendar quarters ending march   and june   the covenant requiring the total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio not to exceed  to  will be effective as of the last day of each calendar quarter commencing with the calendar quarter ending september     in addition a onetime waiver was granted in connection with events of default as defined in the flca credit agreement relating to i the total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio covenant as of the last day of the calendar quarter ending on december   and ii the crossdefault covenant of the flca credit agreement relating to the event of default in the amended pca credit agreement described above   definitive terms of settlement agreement with the olson trust   on february   we entered into the settlement agreement with the olson trust with respect to the lawsuit filed by the olson trust as lessor against the partnership as lessee on january   seeking declaratory judgment that we had breached the terms of two orchard leases upon completion of the transactions contemplated by the settlement agreement we will gain ownership of  acres of land which includes  acres of trees and the land underlying its garage husking drying and office facilities we will have relinquished  acres of leased land the lease for  acres of which was scheduled to expire in  and  acres of which was scheduled to expire in  including  acres of trees and  acres of owned land including  acres of trees see item  – legal proceedings for a more detailed description of the terms of the settlement agreement   going concern   management does not believe that the partnership has sufficient working capital to meet current obligations and debt service requirements for at least the next fiscal year as of december   we had approximately  million of cash and  of working capital we have historically funded our operations through cash flows from operations debt and issuance of equity due to a late and smaller harvest and losses in our branded products segment we will be unable to repay our financial obligations due july   from cash flow generated by operations expenses and inventory are being reduced to fund current operations and we plan to issue equity to raise funds to satisfy the debt requirements or extend the terms of the debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds on terms that are acceptable to us or that we will be able to further extend the terms of our debt if we are not able to raise funds through an equity offering or to extend the terms of our debt we may be forced to sell assets to repay maturing debt or discontinue operations   our consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern which assumes the continuity of operations the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business although we believe that we will be able to generate sufficient liquidity from the measures described above our current circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue to operate as a going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   our operations   we have two business segments orchards and branded products the orchards segment includes our orchard farming and processing operations the branded products segment includes the development manufacture and sale of branded products and the sale of processed kernel   our orchards segment derives its revenues from the sale of wis macadamia nuts grown in orchards we own or lease the sale of dis macadamia nuts the sale of macadamia nut kernel to royal revenues from the farming of macadamia orchards owned by other growers and lease income our financial results are principally driven by nut production which is seasonal and highly contingent upon hawaii’s climatic conditions and nut prices the macadamia crop year in hawaii runs from july  through june  with nuts generally being harvested from august through april nut production is generally highest during the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year with very low production in the first quarter and little or no production in the second quarter nut production in the first half of the year is the result of pollination and nutset that occurs during april through july or august of the previous year factors such as cool temperatures to promote flower development sunlight adequate moisture and its distribution determine the length of the flowerset season      table of contents     our branded products segment derives its revenues from the sale of branded macadamia nut products and bulk macadamia nuts substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to introduce a new product or maintain or improve a brand’s market position promotional allowances such as slotting fees are netted against our revenues therefore an increase in promotional allowances without a resulting increase in sales may decrease our revenues accordingly the future success of the branded products segment depends in large part on our ability to effectively maximize the return on these expenditures to implement our growth strategy of expanding distribution and improving placement of our products and attracting new customers to our brand   how we evaluate our business   in operating our business and monitoring its performance we pay attention to trends in the global and local macadamia nut industries and food manufacturing industry management evaluates the performance of each segment on the basis of operating income and revenue growth in addition we manage our orchards segment based on increased nutinshell productivity farming costs kernel recovery cost stabilization and cash flow generation to support and grow our branded products segment and fund other partnership priorities we manage our branded products segment based on sales including the number of new stores carrying our branded product gross margins and selling expenses the partnership accounts for intersegment sales and transfers at cost plus a markup and such transactions are eliminated in consolidation our branded products segment should enjoy higher growth and has the potential for valueadded innovation and enhanced responsiveness to consumer marketing   results of operations   consolidated revenues cost of revenues and gross profit   for the year ended december   net revenue increased  million or  compared to the year ended  the increase was due to a  million increase in net branded products segment revenue partially offset by a  decrease in orchards revenue orchards revenue on a consolidated basis decreased due to decreased wis nut sales due to lower orchard production   for the year ended december   cost of revenues increased  million or  compared to the same period in  due to increased branded products sales offset by lower volume of wis nut sales to external parties for the year ended december   we generated a gross profit of  million and a gross margin of  compared to gross profit of  million and a gross margin of  for the same

been husked dried and shelled   for the year ended december   cost of orchards revenue decreased  the  decrease in cost of orchards revenue to  million compared to  million for the same period in  was due to the lower revenue because of lower  production generally our orchards segment receives a higher overall gross margin from sales of kernel as compared to sales of wis nuts based upon agreed upon intersegment sales rates and sales to thirdparty customers   operating income decreased  from operating income of  million for the year ended december   to operating income of  for the year ended december   the decrease in operating income was due to lower revenue as a result of lower production and a late start to the harvest   we have three longterm agreements with mauna loa expiring in   and  under which all macadamia nuts produced from the iasco orchards which represented approximately  and  of our production in  and  respectively must be sold to and purchased by mauna loa at a predetermined price under the iasco agreements we are paid based on wis pounds at prices that are derived annually from formulas that factor in the mauna loa wholesale price of the highest yeartodate volume fancy and choice products sold in hawaii and the usda national agricultural statistics service “nass” reported price of wis hawaii macadamia nuts for the period of delivery if the final nass

acquisition through december   recognized on a straight line basis beginning january   through december   the annual rent is  payable in quarterly installments the lessee is responsible for all costs

acres  total does not include tree acres production or yield per acre from the becker orchard as the becker orchard is leased through    we report our financial results on a calendar year basis though the natural crop year generally begins july    our nut production is highly contingent upon hawaii’s climatic conditions the macadamia crop year in hawaii runs from july  through june  with nuts generally harvested from august through april nut production is generally highest during the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year with very low production in the first quarter and little or no production in the second quarter nut production in the first half of the year is the result of pollination and fruit set occurring during april through august of the previous year factors such as cool temperatures to promote flower development sunlight and the amount and timing of moisture determine the length of the flower pollination and fruit set season warm evening temperatures in november and december  resulted in a late start to flowering in both the keaau and ka’u orchards dry weather during the first quarter of  resulted in poor fruit set in the ka’u orchards the combined result of the late flowering and poor fruit set was that harvest started almost a full month later than normal and  production came in  lower than in  this shortfall was largely from the ka’u orchards and iasco orchards which in  produced  and  less than  respectively keaau shortfall was less significant  production was  lower than  production      table of contents     of the approximately  million pounds of production in   million was sold as wis pounds pursuant to the iasco agreements and the remaining amount was sold as wis dis or as kernel to royal in   million was sold as wis pounds pursuant to the iasco agreements and the remaining was sold as dis or kernel to royal   orchards segment – costs of orchard revenue agricultural unit costs depend on the operating expenses required to maintain the orchards and to harvest the crop as well as the quantity of nuts actually harvested   the partnership has seven contracts to farm macadamia orchards owned by other growers these contracts cover macadamia orchards in the same two locations on the island of hawaii where the partnership owns orchards the farming contracts provide for the partnership to be reimbursed for all direct farming costs ie cultivation irrigation and harvesting to collect a pro rata share of indirect costs and overhead and to charge a management fee or fixed fee the management fee is based on the number of acres farmed or on a percentage of total costs billed revenues from farming services were approximately  million in both  and    our unit costs expressed in dollars per wis pound are calculated by dividing all agricultural costs for each orchard including lease rent property tax tree insurance and depreciation by the number of wis pounds of macadamia nuts produced by that orchard for further information

             the volume of nuts produced is a significant factor in the cost per wis pound total actual average cost per wis pound all orchards increased from  in  to  in  an increase of  or  the change in cost per wis pound of the individual orchards was primarily due to the lower production in  due to a late fall harvest and a smaller than anticipated crop at the keaau orchard the cost per wis pound increased by  from  in  to  in  or  at the ka’u orchard without iasco the cost per wis pound increased  from  in  to  in  or    at the iasco orchards the cost per wis pound increased  from  in  to  in  or  this was due to a decrease in annual production at the iasco orchards of  million pounds of wis in  which was primarily due to dry weather resulting in late flowering and poor fruit set and partly due to a late fall harvest   branded products segment   our branded products segment derives its revenues from the sale of bulk nuts three product lines of better for you macadamia nut

gross segment revenue for the year ended december   increased by  million or  to  million compared to  million for the same period in  the higher gross revenue resulted from a  increase from  to  million in bulk nut sales combined with a  increases in gross sales of our branded products demand for bulk kernel continued to be strong through  bulk kernel wholesale prices ranged from  to  per pound in  compared to a range of  to  per pound during  the volume of bulk kernel sold increased due to increased availability of kernel due to higher inventories at the end of  that were sold in  as

consumer coupons the  deductions were  million or  higher than  and represented  and  of gross segment revenue for  and  respectively the decrease in deductions as a percent of revenue was mainly attributable to increased sales of bulk trade discounts increased  slotting fees increased  and promotions increased  royal introduced several new products in  including macadamia nut milk and macadamia nut butter which increased total deductions   cost of revenues excluding intersegment eliminations for the year ended december   increased by  million  compared to  due to the increased

selling expenses in  including freight and warehousing expenses and commissions paid to brokers increased as a result of the increase in the quantity of branded products we sold in  freight costs and warehousing costs increased   and   respectively and broker commissions increased   compared to  increased advertising costs and product development costs also contributed to the increase in selling expenses   interest income and expense   interest expense was  million in  and  in  interest expense results from i the longterm loan used for the asset purchase of the macadamia nut farming operations of iasco ii the revolving line of credit iii the longterm loan used for the purchase of the drying plant and iv the long and shortterm debt for the becker property acquisition the increase in  was attributable to the additional debt incurred in  for the becker property acquisition and phases  and  of our drying plant and a higher average balance on the line of credit      table of

other income offset by higher interest expense   inflation and taxes   in general prices paid to macadamia nut farmers fluctuate independently of inflation macadamia nut prices are influenced strongly by prices for finished macadamia products which depend on competition consumer acceptance and global supply farming costs particularly labor and materials and ga generally reflect inflationary trends   the partnership is subject to a gross income tax as a result of its election to continue to be taxed as a partnership rather than to be taxed as a corporation as allowed by the taxpayer relief act

we are unable to do so we may be forced to or sell assets to repay maturing debt or discontinue operations   while sales of our branded products are anticipated to be only slightly seasonal with the fourth quarter of the calendar year somewhat higher macadamia nut production is very seasonal with the largest quantities typically being inventoried from september through november resulting in large

offbalance sheet arrangements   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity or cash flows   critical accounting policies and estimates   management has identified the following critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates those estimates including those related to asset impairment accruals for selfinsurance compensation and related benefits revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for sales returns inventory valuation allowances realization of tax assets contingencies and litigation we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in relevant sections in this discussion and analysis these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could materially differ from those estimates   we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements        table of contents     employee benefits we sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for regular bargaining unit employees and a severance plan for intermittent bargaining unit employees several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to these plans these factors include assumptions about the discount rate expected return on plan assets withdrawal and mortality rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter mortality of participants these differences may impact the amount of retirement and severance benefit expense recorded by us in future periods   valuation of longlived assets we review for impairment longlived assets held and used or held for sale whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if an evaluation is required the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment charge is required all longlived assets for which management has committed to a plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value changes in projected cash flows generated by an asset based on new events or circumstances may require a change in fair value and a new evaluation of recoverability of the asset   inventories we review the inventory held at year end and value it based on the lower of cost or market branded finished goods inventory includes cost of all raw ingredients packaging roasting and other ancillary costs   revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue under all of our nut purchase contracts and for our branded products using the best information available to the partnership at the time it files its quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts are based on historical and currently available information revenues from branded products are recorded net of customer incentives we offer our customers a variety of sales and incentive programs including discounts allowances coupons slotting fees and advertising such amounts are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue   income taxes we review our deferred tax asset recorded for royal due to the uncertainty regarding future realization of the deferred tax asset we recorded a valuation allowance equal to  of the deferred tax asset   allocation of general and administrative expenses to subsidiary we estimate an allocation of costs to royal for management and administrative services provided by the partnership and its subsidiaries to royal based on time spent on royal by the respective employees the partnership also allocates certain of its shared general and administrative expenses to royal the cost allocations are reviewed throughout the year for reasonableness these allocations are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements   new accounting standards   see note  – summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements

risks resulting from changes in the market price of macadamia kernel pursuant to the terms of one license agreement and two lease agreements production from the iasco orchards which represented approximately  of our  production must be sold to mauna loa at a price based on two components  mauna loa’s wholesale price of the highest yeartodate volume fancy and choice products sold in hawaii and  the usda nass reported price of wis hawaii macadamia nuts for the period of delivery when the usda price for a crop year is released mauna loa adjusts the price for that crop year retrospectively a  increase or decrease in the usda nass reported price would affect the price received by us for production from the iasco orchards by  per wis pound based on  production of  pounds from the iasco orchards an increase in the usda nass reported price of  per pound would have increased our revenues for the year ended december   by  and a decrease in the usda nass reported price of  per pound would have decreased our revenues for the year ended december   by    we are exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates the interest rate on our revolving credit facility is based on a base rate as defined in the amended pca credit agreement and is determined by the higher of the federal funds rate or the prime rate in effect on the day of the borrowing the rate currently in effect is  per annum a  increase or decrease per  million of borrowing results in an interest expense fluctuation of approximately  per annum      table of contents     item  consolidated financial

attributable to each orchard in accordance with industry practice in hawaii and acc ounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” orchard maintenance and harvesting costs for commercially producing macadamia orchards are charged against earnings or added to inventory in the year that the costs are incurred costs are expensed if nuts are sold wetinshell “wis” and added to inventory if nuts are retained to be sold as dryinshell “dis” bulk kernel or branded products     f table of contents     however the timing and manner in which farming costs are recognized in the partnership’s consolidated financial statements over the course of the year is based on management’s estimate of annual farming costs expected to be incurred for interim financial reporting purposes farming costs are recognized as expense or added to inventory based on an estimate of the cost incurred to produce macadamia nuts sold during the quarter management estimates the average cost per pound for each orchard based on the estimated annual costs to farm each orchard and the anticipated annual production from each orchard the amount of farming costs recognized as expense or added to inventory throughout the year is calculated by multiplying each orchard’s estimated cost per pound by the actual production from that orchard the difference between actual farming costs incurred and the amount of farming costs recognized as expense is recorded as either an increase or decrease in deferred farming costs which is reported as an asset in the consolidated balance sheets deferred farming costs accumulate throughout the year typically peaking midway through the third quarter since nut production is typically lowest during the first and second quarter of the year deferred farming costs are expensed or added to inventory over the remainder of the year since nut production is typically highest at the end of the third and fourth quarters management evaluates the validity of each orchard’s estimated cost on a monthly basis based on actual production and farming costs incurred as well as any known events that might significantly affect forecasted annual production and farming costs for the remainder of the year   inventory inventories are recorded at the lower of cost determined under the firstin firstout and standard cost methods or market writedowns are provided for finished goods expected to become nonsaleable due to age and provisions are specifically made for slow moving or obsolete raw ingredients and packaging material the company also adjusts the carrying value of its inventories when it believes that the net realizable value is less than the carrying value these writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory including estimated costs to complete and estimated selling prices including cost of selling these charges are recorded as a component of cost of sales once inventory is written down a new lower cost basis for inventory is established   land orchards and equipment land orchards and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization net farming costs for any “developing” orchards are capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets until revenues exceed expenses for that orchard or nine years after planting if earlier developing orchards historically do not reach commercial viability until about  years of age   depreciation of orchards and other equipment is reported on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  years for orchards between  and  years for irrigation and well equipment and between  and  years for other equipment a  residual value is assumed for orchards the macadamia orchards acquired in  situated on leased land

or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if an evaluation is required the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment charge is required if an impairment charge is required the partnership would write the assets down to fair value all longlived assets for which management has committed to a plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value as determined by quoted market price or a present value technique changes in projected cash flows generated by an asset based on new events or circumstances may indicate a change in fair value and require a new evaluation of recoverability of the asset there were no indicators of

specifically the following statement may now be applied in connection to the consumption of whole or chopped macadamia nuts including raw blanched roasted salted or unsalted andor lightly coated andor flavored macadamia nuts “supportive but not conclusive research shows that eating  ounces per day of macadamia nuts as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol and not resulting in increased intake of saturated fat or calories may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease” see nutritional information for fat and calorie content “this is a truly a historic day for everyone in the macadamia nut industry” said scott wallace of royal hawaiian macadamia nut “research about the benefits macadamia nuts have for heart health has existed for decades and we’ve worked tirelessly to secure the legal right to share this with the masses many people associate almonds pistachios and walnuts with better health but this momentous decision from the fda now puts macadamia nuts in a similar category we want consumers to know that there is real supportive evidence with respect to the benefits of consuming macadamia nuts consumers are aware of the benefits of consuming other tree
