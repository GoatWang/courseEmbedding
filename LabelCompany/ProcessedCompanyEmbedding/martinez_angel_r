software the book concentrates on the simulationmonte carlo point of view and contains algorithms for exploratory data analysis modeling monte carlo simulation pattern recognition bootstrap classification crossvalidation methods probability density estimation random number generation and other computational statistics methodsemphasis on the practical aspects of statistics details of the
