success we offer markets in futures and options on futures contracts based on the us interest rate yield curve equity indexes foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy metals and alternative investment products our products are traded through the cme globex electronic trading platform our open outcry auction markets in chicago and new york city or through privately negotiated transactions that we clear for the year ended december   we derived  billion or  of our total revenues from fees associated with trading and clearing our products these fees include per contract charges for trade execution clearing and cme globex fees fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded the method of trade and the trading privileges of the customer making the trade generally members are charged lower fees than nonmembers certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our efforts to encourage increased liquidity in our markets our markets also generate valuable data and information regarding pricing and trading activity in our products we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers see item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations page  for the average daily volume of contracts traded in our four principal product lines for the last three years although dislocations in credit and lending markets have significantly impacted our interest rate complex our other product lines especially equity indexes showed solid volume growth in  looking forward we will continue to focus on expense discipline while providing customers with the best ways to manage risk at a time of economic uncertainty interest rate products our interest rate products enable banks and other financial institutions worldwide to hedge interest rate risks and in turn help to reduce the overall cost of borrowing and financing our interest rate products allow our customers to execute transactions across the entire us dollardenominated yield curve using some of the worlds most actively traded futures and options products customers may manage short medium and longterm interest rate risk using our products based on eurodollars us treasuries swaps and other dollarrelated instruments as a result of our acquisition of cbot our interest rate products include cbots thirtyyear us treasury bond futures and options on futures tenyear fiveyear and twoyear us treasury note futures and options and interest rate swap futures and options and federal funds futures and options fiftytwo percent of our overall annual trading volume in  and  of our clearing and transaction fees was based upon our interest rate products the overall volume of our interest rate product line was down compared with  the decrease was as a result of decreased trading in our eurodollar options contract due to increased volatility in the relationship between the london interbank offered rate libor and the overnight federal funds effective rate declining correlations between risk free treasury rates and spread products a slowdown in corporate debt and mortgage originations industry consolidation declining assets under management a severe decrease in mortgagerelated structured product transactions and pressure resulting from failures in the repo market in  we believe that our interest rate product line will continue to be negatively impacted by the current state of the economy and a zero interest rate policy we believe that this decline could be partially offset by the increased treasury issuances and the need to manage the associated interest rate risks as well as transitions to exchange traded and cleared products by overthecounter participants in response to heightened concerns about counterparty risk and the need for greater balance sheet efficiencies equity products our equity products permit investors to obtain exposure for hedging or speculative purposes to changes in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities by allowing investors to effectively manage stock market risks our equity products increase investor confidence and overall participation in these important markets we are a leading equity index marketplace offering futures and options products including our emini contracts on key benchmark equity indexes covering small medium and largecap companies in the us europe and asia these include the standard  poors dow jones nasdaq nikkei msci and ftsexinhua indexes and others we have exclusive licensing arrangements with standard  poors corporation sp nasdaq omx group inc nasdaq omx and dow jones  company inc dow jones which allow us to offer futures and options on futures on their indexes including our contracts based on the sp  index the nasdaq index and the dow jones industrial average for a detailed description of these licensing arrangements see the section of this annual report on form k entitled item  businesslicensing agreements    table of contents trading in these products represented  of our total trading volume and  of our clearing and transaction fees during  we believe our leading market position in equity products is a result of the liquidity of our markets the status of the sp  the nasdaq and the dow jones industrial average indexes as the principal us financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns and the appeal to investors and traders of our emini products and other equity products and our cme globex platform these investors include public and private pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity markets we believe future growth in our equity products will come from increased counterparty credit concerns continued education of our customers as to the benefits of our equity product portfolio to serve their risk management needs and the benefits of futures products over cash equities we believe that our equity volumes may also be impacted by the trading volume levels of the underlying markets as well as their level of volatility foreign exchange products we became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futures in  our foreign exchange market serves as an effective and efficient means of risk transfer for the global foreign exchange market bringing together a broad array of client segments by offering investment as well as risk management opportunities our customers benefit from dealing anonymously in a fully transparent market where large and small customers have equal access to the same prices and deep pool of liquidity our foreign exchange products provide the tools and resources to hedge foreign exchange risk facilitating crossborder trade and commerce while mitigating the risks to profitability due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market our foreign exchange market attracts both buy and sellside investors including commercial and investment banks hedge funds commodity trading advisors proprietary trading firms and individual investors approximately  of our foreign exchange products are traded electronically on the cme globex platform ensuring that business is transacted quickly with maximum operational efficiency today we offer approximately  foreign exchange futures and approximately  foreign exchange options on futures products covering major as well as a broad array of emerging market currency pairs in more than  different currencies in  we saw an average daily volume of  foreign exchange contracts per day with a notional value of  billion a day trading in our foreign exchange products represented  of our total trading volume in  and  of our clearing and transaction fees we believe future growth in our foreign exchange product line will come from expanding and diversifying our product suite and customer base for example trading in volatilitybased options on six of our foreign exchange options began in march  we are expanding our foreign exchange options product suite to appeal to a broader array of customer segments and we expect continued strong growth in the electronic execution of foreign exchange options on cme globex in  as we expand our global footprint in the foreign exchange market we expect increased trading volume from customers outside of the united states we also expect an increased demand in the overthecounter market for cleared products which we are targeting firms however have reduced their foreign exchange trading volume in light of the current economic conditions and consolidation within the industry commodity and alternative investment products our commodity products help establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management these products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities including agricultural producers of commodities food processors and consumers of energy commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business we have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products including futures contracts based on cattle hogs pork bellies lumber dairy products soybeans corn wheat oats and rough rice following our acquisition of nymex we also offer contracts based on crude oil natural gas heating oil gasoline copper and aluminum as well as other soft commodities our energy products offer a way for producers marketers and refiners to manage fuel price risk in a volatile growing market faced with mounting regulatory and market pressures in september  we sold the cbot metals trading complex to nyse euronext we also provide our customers with nontraditional alternative investment products to diversify and manage their risk our real estate products provide opportunities for risk protection and extend to the real estate industry the same financial tools that our previous innovations have brought to agriculture and finance by providing a means of hedging exposure to real estate prices customers can diffuse the potential impact of sustained declines in real estate prices we also are the only regulated exchange that offers risk management products on the weather market through our weather contracts based on aggregate temperatures in more than  cities around the world as well as hurricane snowfall and frost indexes commodity and alternative investment products accounted for  of our trading volume and  of our clearing and transaction fees during     table of contents we continue to execute our strategy of growing our customer base and providing sidebyside access to our commodity markets we believe the changing perception of commodities as an asset class provides an opportunity for growth in our markets we also anticipate growth in our energy products as a result of price volatility increased use of cme clearport due to credit concerns and continued enhancements to our product portfolio however we believe that increases in volume may be offset by the negative impact of the current economic situation market data and information products our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products that we believe enhances the appeal of our products the dissemination of realtime data generates revenues and supports our customer base with timely market information we sell our market data which includes information about bids offers trades and trade size in our products to banks brokerdealers pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions we distribute our market data directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets through our electronic facilities we also distribute market data via dedicated networks to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges other third party data providers and news services and then resell their consolidated data revenues from market data products totaled  million or  of our total revenues in  sophisticated quantitative approaches to risk management as well as customer time sensitivity have created new needs uses and demands for tradingrelated data and analytics this timely information has become even more important in light of the volatility and uncertainty in todays markets we continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by creating new valueadded services to complement our market data products including databases analytical tools and other services to assist endusers in

provide access to all prices for products listed on the minneapolis grain exchange and the kansas city board of trade which are available for electronic trading on cme globex we believe that there has been a decline in subscriptions of market data due primarily to the consolidation of many of our customers and related headcount reductions as a result of the current financial crisis for example the number of subscriptions for devices for cme and cbot market data combined decreased from  at december   to  december   to the extent that our customers continue to consolidate we could experience
