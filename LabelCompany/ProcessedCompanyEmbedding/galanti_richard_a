remarks i’d written down over the last  months of covering the rapidly evolving world of food retail came last september from costco cfo richard galanti who as is often the case in analyst conference calls was under light interrogation about the big club’s ability to withstand competition from amazon without having a significant strategy to sell food online itself events since then would indicate that galanti’s message was heard loud and clear by costco’s seattle neighbor which in june acknowledged as much by committing  billion to acquire one of the best in the freshfood business whole foods market  people in this article richard a galanti  costco is a buy despite amazon fears analysts  ” michael laaser of ubs echoed the upbeat sentiment writing in a research note that the latest report helped “serve as a reminder of just how powerful costco’s membership model has become” while costco’s online business is slated to make up just  of its overall sales this year according to chief financial officer cfo richard galanti the wholesaler will beef up its digital initiative in order to better compete with the dominating force of amazon although ecommerce is important to costco’s future business galanti has reiterated the fact investors shouldn’t expect costco to be like amazon as the company will continue to rely on bringing in members into its warehouses by improving
