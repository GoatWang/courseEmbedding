of a lower abv so you are not wasted after drink  of them time it for summer and you will be happy next time i will add some coriander and maybe an orange peel to zest it up a bit it is definitely not

wbrett this beer is good as is but find it kind of plain i recently used this kit and added  oz of citra hops  oz each at   and  min i pitched the regular yeast and a brett c yeast at the same time i had my first taste last night at  weeks and its fantastic the brett character is pretty mild at this point but present for those that like brett beers dont be afraid to try them for a  brett beer you have to be patient but pitching with another just add some character and after a few weeks in the keg the beer changes over time got great advice from the people at odd  brewing in lafayette co was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate december   bill was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate my first really good brew i brewed this beer a couple months ago in order to take it up with me on a weeks vacation boating skiing fishing and just general summer tomfoolery this beer was the perfect complement to that type of fun my brotherinlaws loved it my wife loves it this is my fourth batch of beer ive ever brewed its the first batch ive finished where at the end of the process i thought to myself wow you did everything exactly how you had planned to do it the results were amazing this is a fantastic beer and im a self professed saison snob i love me some saison and this beer definitely is a fantastically drinkable version the french saison yeast strain gives it a unique flavor enjoy was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate august   fantastic in the summer was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate great kitbetter beer i added a cup of table sugar to boost the gravity on this a titchended up at abv with good attenuation and very little if any additional sweetness from the sugar boost had it in the primary for  weeks and its been bottled for just a weekeven nonbeer drinkers have said how much they like it nice citrusy nose well balanced and a dry finish begging for another sip swallow swig orratsnow i need another one  was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate july   biscuit was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate what a delightful surprise i bought this kit on a whim looking for a light summer style beer to have ready once the warm weather rolled into pittsburgh well the weather is here and i just poured myself one of these and wow is it fantastic i did a  gallon boil as my megapot hadnt arrived yet back in april i did one week primary and then decided in the interest of clarity for a summer beer to do a brief secondary i did a  week secondary and then kegged the beer has been sitting under pressure for a little over two weeks and i had some when it was only under pressure for  days and it was ok but after  weeks of conditioning and  degrees here in pittsburgh this one is perfect buy it now brew it now and youll thank me in july was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate june   greg was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate first and one of the best i brewed this as my first batch ever and even after brewing around  batches of other recipes since it was probably my favorite was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate april   ky was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate great beer i brewed this for my buddy who doesnt care for ipas and or stouts and was pleasantly surprised at how it turned out have to admit i kinda like the more basic recipes cause they allow you to tweak and tinker with the beer added a pound of orange clover honey at the end and bumped the abv up a little still easy drinking and great springsummer brew will be ordering this again was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate january   phillybrewer was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate petite saison dete  great for summer i tried mine with the orange peel boiled then into secondary only oranges carefully peeled with special peeler so as not to get any of the white partpith after  weeks in bottle just tried last night outstanding strongly recommend this will be hard to save for summer was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate march   brew d was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate amazing i cant believe how great this brew was in just four weeks its carbonated beautifully with a mounding head nonbeer drinkers like it a lot and its an easy beer to drink was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate december   john was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate sensational first homebrew i chose to brew this as my first ever homebrew brewed this on a saturday and the nb black ipa on sunday i enjoy belgians quite a bit and i thought this seemed fitting for springearly summer i followed the instructions with the exception of not racking it to secondary i kept it on the yeast caketroub the whole time i made a hr yeast starter and the fermentation took off really quick i sampled it right before bottling and i was not impressed at all  it felt very watery and weak decided to bottle  see what carbonation would do for mouthfeel and flavor bottled with oz corn sugar  no problems at all i waited a full  days before sampling my first bottle and it was spot on such an improvement once it was carbed up a month after bottling i sampled this brew with  friends next to boulevards tank  and great divides colette even as my first brew this stands right up to the two i just mentioned and my friends had a difficult time recognizing which was the homebrew bottom line  everyone really loves it and it is a very approachable beer was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate june   zach j was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate best brew that ive made thus far i fermented in the primary for two weeks and its been bottle conditioning for a week i couldnt wait til next week so we cracked one open wow if this is still green i can only imagine how good this will be once its fully conditionedi might take it a step further and do a secondary on my next batch just to reduce sediment and provide a little more clarity but man this is fully carbonated beautifully colored great head great lacing and has a great nose but isnt too hoppy on the tongue was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate august   john was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate awesome quick beer i had this in the primary for  week then a bottle for a week can taste the spiciness already but after another week the beer has started to settle out and has become a great beer already after  weeks i will order this again and play with the recipe was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate october   summer special was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate best one yet i have only made  brews before this one and i love dark beers but when i tasted a saison at brew club i had to make one this by far had the best flavor and body all the other kits i had made lacked the bodymouthfeel i expected but this one is simply amazing i even opened my first bottle after  days because i was unavailing my porter american cream ale and pale ales to a couple buddies and they thought it was the best of the night was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate july   mandrew was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate brilliant i have to start the review by saying i didnt exactly follow the recipe i added coriander and bitter orange just like a wit and followed the addition schedule just like the nb wit kit the result is so phenomenal i cant put it into words i cant believe i made this the instructions say  weeks in the fermenter but after  week the gravity was down to  so i called it done bottled it up and after only  week in the bottle it is simply brilliant very easy to make the french saison yeast nb recommends from wyest is easier to use than the belgian version this stuff should get better since ive only given it a week in the bottle but i cant imagine it being better than it is nowthis is a homerun summer session beer  stars was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate july   mattn was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate good stuff i made this kit but in addition i added four pounds of hand picked peaches the flavor was clovey and had a subtle dry peachy spicy finish was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate august   shane was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate great beer i made this kit but substituted danstar belle saison for the listed choices fermented at  for two weeks bottled one week and tasted great just like you expect from a saison  fruity a bit funky incredibly refreshing i could drink it all day my friends are big fans of this one was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate july   aaron was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate good stuff i make the allgrain version of this its very good better than even belgianfrench commercial saisons i add quite a bit of spice to it as well coriander orange peel ginger cardamom and a bit of honey or sugar at flameout saisons are great to tweak for personal preference was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate august   muttlofe was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate tasty nice summer brew crisp refreshing with nice aromas i can see brewing this one before the summer ends if you like the belgium dubbel you will like this ones flavor was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate june   ryan b was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate never fails to impress i really cannot decide which nb saison recipe is best they are all different and all fantastic i really like the petite because its closer to a traditional not too high alcohol not too hoppy just right i add some spices usually coriander and orange peel and it is just great next go around i may bump the gravity a bit and go with ginger and orange peel and try to do a hennepin clone was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate march   matt was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate superb i really liked this i added another lb of wheat dme to up the abv used the  yeast my fermenting was in typical summer house temps around f it came out spicy and delicious after  months  weeks in the bottle it really mellowed out and the spicy character subsided like they say  when you drink the last bottle the beer is ready to drink i will do this one again or i might go with the regular saison as opposed to the petit because i like my beer to have a bit more kick was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate august   brewham was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate great kit  i recently decided to brew my own beer and came across northern brewer while researching over the internet i picked this extract kit based strictly on the rave reviews that it received well i just finished my very first brew and wowi will never buy grocery store beer again i followed the instructions that came with the kit and used the  french saison yeast i also added orange peel and coriander seed because i a big fan of those belgium brews my first brew has excellent flavor and claritya nice headand a kick is a fantastic yeastive got an abv of  i could not believe that i actually made this great beer i also want to acknowledge the staff at northern brewer i had a damaged yeast package on this first shipment that was immediately replaced at no charge i am very happy that i chose northern brewer for my first attempt at home brewingnow please restock this kit as soon as possible was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate june   kenny was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate smooth i stumbled into brewing this brew i intended on doing the petite orange but accidentally grabbed this because i was talking to someone ive been making homebrew for about a year now and this is one of my best kits not a lot of ingredients but still produces a distinctive taste theres a peppery taste on the back end which i questioned if i would enjoy but i do very much my batch yielded a higher abv then i expected around  its also the lightest brew that i have made i will be brewing this again because it wont last was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate march   chuck was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate good summer beer this is a good simple refreshing farmhouse ale i brewed it with the recommended danstar dry yeast and got a crisper smoother ale the fermentation was quick and the beer was done a week early the liquid yeasts will probably give different results with more of the citrus and spice flavors was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate september   mitchell k was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate my third batch i took this recipe and tinkered with it a bit i added an ounce of german herzbrucker hops at  minutes and a pound of honey at flameout everyone who tried the beer really liked it even with the extra additions this remained a very simple straightforward beer very light mouthfeel and very refreshing the star of this beer is the french saison yeast which took the beer all the way down to a fg of  the yeast also produced a slightly fruity flavor that is very pleasant if you buy this kit get the wy yeast you wont be sorry i plan on brewing more beers with this yeast as well was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate april   daniel was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate loved it this was my first foray into belgium styles and it was great nice and light but still had a lot of flavor great for summer was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate september   john c was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate you better get this one i usually like a darker beer like irish ales and even ipas i wanted to try a lighter beer for the summer season i read through many of the reviews for saisons and wandered upon this petite saison it sounded a little dainty for me but i gave it a shot wowyou have got to get this beer kit the recipe was a little more difficult than what im used to doing however i followed the directions to the tee and i was blown away with the outcome it was hoppy but not like an ipa it has a great head and laces wonderfully great carbonation i dont have any complaint about this beer i am ordering another one this week to make sure i dont run out of this beergreat job northern brewer was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate june   scott was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate crisp summer brew i waited  weeks after bottling to drink and it was crisp and smooth the longer the bottleõs sat the better it got very refreshing light and crisp had better hop flavoring than i expected was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate august   richard was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate very nice summer beer i wasnt expecting too much but thought id try this one mostly due to its  week  ready appeal it is my second brew from northern and i can see myself doing this one again and again and again  lighter taste than what i usually brew it does have more kick than i expected  okay i should learn how to use the avb tools was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate may   jeffrey was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate blue ribbon summer beer i won first place with this beer in a lawn mower beer competition the flavor of this beer is what won everyone over excellent flavor spicy but not heavy very refreshing great beer for a hot summers dayor any day was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate june   melody was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate excellent beer i made this beer by using white labs trappist ale and adding approximately  lb of honey to boost the og to  fermented out to  while using a fermentation temperature of  degrees after primary fermentation was complete i let it sit in my basement at  degrees for  weeks and then legged it what an excellent beer this is well balanced light easy drinking with lots of yeast character and not overwhelming with esters for me keeping this beer lower end of the fermentation range produced a very well balanced beer if you are brewing this in the spring for a great summer beer you may do well adding orange peel because i feel that would go extremely well with the flavor profile i will be trying it this way for a summer saison was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate october   brandon h was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate sensation if i could give it  stars i probably would but its a really great beer that deserves  over  my only issue with this otherwise phenomenal brew is that i wish it had just a bit more complexity to it tis delicious  an easy drinking citrushinting bundle of yum ill definitely brew it again and perhaps try some honey or lemon or orange peel in the boil was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate july   nate was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate perfect for summer if its warm out this is beer to drink its sessionable refreshing and absolutely delicious the kit is incredibly easy to brew and ready to drink in short order after two weeks in primary and three days force carbing in the keg this brew is perfect was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate june   ed was this review helpful yes  no  flag as

october   matt j was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate delicious easy and a great base for tinkering its astonishing to me that a beer this easy tastes this good its also a great base for tinkering i added rose hips near the beginning of the boil rose flowers near the end and hibiscus flowers near the end of fermentation based on a jolly pumpkin recipe and it was great we offer this scent of flowers saison at a production put on by a theater company my brewbuddies and i are involved with and people really seem to like itits a very accessible entrypoint into slightly funky tart beers which made it perfect to offer to our theater audience was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate july   aaron was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate best batch

contribute alcohol to the beer unless you use a darker colored version which would of course add color to the mixture as well as more flavors depending on the candi syrupsugar choice reply inaccurate
