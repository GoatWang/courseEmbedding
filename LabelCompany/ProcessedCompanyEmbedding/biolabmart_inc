expect to use any such proceeds for a expenses associated with the license agreement b sec registration listing and clearance fees c branding and marketing and d general corporate purposes the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products and any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future while we believe that our novel approaches and scientific expertise in our ability to produce and deliver cultured growth mediums containing molecules of superior regenerative efficacy will provide us with competitive advantages we face potential competition from many different sources including larger and betterfunded pharmaceutical specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as from academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions that may develop potentially competitive products or technologies to the extent that we develop product candidates for indications with larger patient populations we expect to experience particularly intense competition from larger and better funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies any product candidate that we may develop will compete with such larger and better funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies established drugs or solutions and new drug candidates being developed by others that may currently be in clinical trials currently there are no approved products for our lead product candidate we believe the key competitive factors that will affect the success of our product candidate if approved are likely to be their efficacy safety convenience of administration and delivery price the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other thirdparty payors many of our potential competitors alone or with their strategic partners have substantially greater financial technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop our competitors also may obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before
