factors contact an investment in the fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program the fund is designed as a longterm investment and not as a trading vehicle investing in the fund involves risks including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or even all of your investment therefore before investing you should carefully consider the risks that you assume when you invest in the funds common shares securities backed by commercial real estate assets are subject to securities market risks similar to those of direct ownership of commercial real estate loans including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate declines in rental or occupancy rates and risks related to general and local economic conditions the funds investment objectives and policies are not designed to seek to return the initial investment to investors that purchase shares investing in the fund involves risks including exposure to belowinvestment grade investments ie junk bonds the fund’s net asset value will vary and its distribution rate may vary and both may be affected by numerous factors including changes in the market spread over a specified benchmark market interest rates and performance of the broader equity markets fluctuations in net asset value may be magnified as a result of the fund’s use of leverage because the fund is newly organized its common shares have no history of public trading shares of closedend investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value and initial offering prices the risks associated with this characteristic of closedend investment companies may be greater for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after completion of the initial public offering for further discussion of these and additional risks associated with an investment in the fund see important information and risk factors investors should consider the funds investment objectives risks charges and expenses carefully before investing the prospectus contains this and other information about the fund please read the prospectus carefully before investing for more complete information about the fund please read the prospectus call your financial professional or call  the fund is a closedend fund and does not continuously issue shares for sale as openend mutual funds do since the initial public offering the fund now trades in the secondary market investors wishing to buy or sell shares need to place
