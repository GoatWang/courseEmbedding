you all for joining us today on such short notice i am extremely pleased and humbled to announce today that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire kcg holdings kcg is a prominent and unique franchise that has served in these – of an impressive array of customers for decades this is a transformative acquisition for virtu and represents a natural evolution for our company our scale efficiency and advanced order routing capabilities will now be married with kcg’s extraordinary client franchise and kcgs hundreds of talented employees and will allow virtu to accelerate its strategic priorities importantly this transaction takes place that what we believe is an opportune time to be investing in the market making and agency businesses given historically low points in global realized volatility which are naturally cyclical finally we will be able to achieve meaningful cost and capital synergies that will create significant value for virtu’s shareholders i will go through some selective slides in the presentation that we have distributed this morning and discuss the strategic rationale and why this transaction is a unique opportunity that will expand strengthen and diversify the combined platform and set us up for future growth then i will turn the call over to joe to discuss select key terms and review detail around significant expense and capital synergies in this transaction while on a standalone basis virtu’s role as the leading liquidity provider across asset classes in  countries continues to grow simply put this transaction will allow us to access for the first time customer order flow in our americas equities business and accelerate our growth in our agency execution segment as outlined in the slide  we will leverage virtu’s scale geographic reach and micro market structure expertise to interact with order flow that kcg receives from its customer franchise we believe we can enhance the customer experience and improve profitability by trading more efficiently and using virtu’s advanced order routing capabilities our experience outside the united states where we interact with retail and institutional order flow in a segmented manner is that our execution quality and profitability while interacting with this type of flow is significantly enhanced and we are very excited about the opportunities presented as you know offering virtu’s superior routing capabilities and posttrade analytics to select buy side clients has been a strategic priority and we have received tremendous feedback kcg has built a marquee franchise in global execution services with connectivity to hundreds of buy side and sell side financial institution in an impressive suite of algorithmic products these established relationships will provide immediate and significant growth opportunities as we marry virtu’s competencies with kcg’s preeminent franchise further we believe the breath of the combined companies geographic and asset class footprint will strengthen our position as the leading partner for buy side and sell side institutions for infrastructure and agency execution services we will also generate significant value creation in this transaction we anticipate approximately  million of fully phasedin pretax net synergies in a transaction that is over  accretive to virtu’s eps on a run rate basis joe will provide details on these figures including the transaction details in slide  however i do want to note that this transaction is financed partially with a  million equity investment from a mix of old and new shareholders including temasek as well as our new partners at north island led by glenn hutchins and bob greifeld who are supported by psp investments one of canadas largest pension funds and gic a sovereign wealth fund of singapore the debt component is supported by a commitment from our partners at jp morgan to provide up to  billion in debt financing for the transaction the participation of the sophisticated global investors in our due diligence and structuring of this transaction is humbling and a tremendous vote of confidence in virtu following the close of the transaction i will serve as ceo of the combined company and joe will remain the cfo we are very excited and look forward to working with the talented worldclass employees of kcg who share our values and a culture of innovation and we are committed to realizing the full benefits of this transaction additionally two members of the board of directors will be added to our current board for a combined board of ten im thrilled to announce that bob greifeld and glenn hutchins will both join us as partners and board members both have decades of experience in the financial services area and were pioneers in the first stage of electronification of the us equity markets they share our vision that as markets become more competitive and expensive to access only integrated financial services firms with true global scale will be capable of offering a superior twosided price to end users and be consistently profitable turning to slide  i wanted to highlight how the strategic objectives we have identified to create longterm shareholder value for virtu are accelerated in this transaction we have said since our founding that our mission is to be the best fit and offer in all of the over  markets in which we participate in  countries globally this transaction will allow us to move upstream and interact with order flow that prior to this transaction virtu was not able to interact with in the united states and offer the enhanced value to these customers as i noted above for us this is an extraordinary opportunity virtu has built a thriving business in us equities based on market making without any customer flow now as we do in other parts of the world we will be able to provide virtu’s broad liquidity to wholesale order flow that tends to be noncorrelated so this in no way represents a new business for us it is simply market making upstream by interacting with segmented retail and institutional and order flow as a firm we are very excited about these prospects turning to slide  i want to point out that this combination we believe will enhance the market making and agency business of virtu and kcg in a way that neither of us could achieve on our own kcg and virtu each have unique strengths that can be levered to benefit the wholesale principle and agency offerings before turning this over to joe and for qa i want to thank the many team members at kcg and virtu as well as our respective advisors who helped bring us to this point in particular i’ve got to know very well and respect kcg’s talented chief executive officer daniel coleman throughout this process and my personal thanks to daniel for shepherding this process through joe joseph molluso thank you doug i will pick up the slide deck on slide  which shows the enhanced diversification to our revenue stream this transaction will bring based on  numbers this transaction will increase virtu’s nonmarket making net revenues from  of the total to nearly  an important and strategic diversification slide  reviews the expense synergies there will be significant value creation to virtu’s shareholders derived from achievable expense synergies through identifying redundant operations and consolidating businesses trading debts office facilities and other identified savings we believe we will achieve run rate net expense synergies of  million over the first  months post closing in addition we believe these efficiencies which we have identified will concurrently results in the reduction of capital usage for the combined company by  million which will be used to rapidly pay down debt and return the combined company to its current capital structure on a pro forma basis slide  is an attempt to demonstrate the powerful impact the transaction will have on our aftertax earnings what we have done here is attempt to provide you with the pieces needed to understand how accretive this transaction is to virtu when you look at a fully phasedin in this case year two of the transaction in this case  you see that aftertax synergies net of revenue dissynergies are  million after applying the proceeds from debt reduction and other cash flows to pay down debt to current combined company levels we’re assuming incremental  million in interest expense aftertax you can then model across a variety of scenarios for kcg’s standalone contribution and therefore we expect over  earnings accretion across a range of scenarios finally i wanted to note on slide  a significant unmodeled upside potential not included in any of the synergy estimates we have shared with you this morning as you know with significant volumes we’re able to achieve higher fee tiers at the venues on which we trade we can estimate this figure today at  million to  million given the scale of the combined operation we will be able to internalize more order flow which will allow greater profitability reduce transaction costs and better performance for the end customer we believe there will be network effects and enhanced trading opportunities from combining both firms intellectual property virtu experiences a similar phenomenon when it merged with madison tyler in  the combined business will benefit from kcg and virtus work in building out low latency networks and will benefit from increased order execution efficiency as a result of this we believe these elements of conservatism allow us to be very confident that this transaction will be significantly accretive and create value for virtu’s shareholders we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows from operations we mention that we will incur an incremental  million of new borrowings at the outset on a pro forma basis at the time of the close we expect the combined company to have total leverage of  times trailing  months combined pro forma adjusted ebitda including the achievable synergies this leverage ratio would be  times less than a turn of ebitda more than we have today we intend to delever using significant proforma cash flow as well as the aforementioned  million in capital usage to pay down debt we expect to delever to a ratio similar to our current level of debt within  to  months after the close of this transaction finally weve included a synopsis of preliminary q numbers for virtu we will announce q earnings on may th and have a full press release the same environment that is impacted kcg’s q earnings mainly historic lows and intraday volatility and realized volatility has also impacted virtu’s results for the quarter we expect to report adjusted net trading income of  million and adjusted ebitda of  million getting back to the transaction we expect the transaction to close in the third quarter of  upon receipt of regulatory clearances and approval of stockholder of ours once this transaction closes we will begin implementing the detailed integration plan to bring these two great companies together both the kcg and virtu teams are confident in our ability to consummate successful transaction with that i will turn the call over to the qa session questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of warren gardiner evercore isi douglas cifu good morning warren warren gardiner can you may be just dig into the  million of revenue dissynergies a bit more like kind of where that comes from and what are some of the assumptions behind that number douglas cifu sure i think its really twofold and joe can help you with all the details but its – we assume that theres going to be some books of business that are capital inefficient if you will that we will in a reduced positions and then get out of and so theres some revenue loss there but significant capital pick ups and as well we assume that therell be some in the transition that therell be some revenue loss from customers that trade away for a time period but would come back so i would argue – i would think that those numbers are conservative but we wanted to make sure that they were included in the model from the get go we think we can ultimately outperform that but we wanted to be conservative with our revenue dissynergies joe joseph molluso yeah thats right i mean we are trying to be quite conservative as doug said as we look at businesses where capital does not – the capital does not supported by the profitability and obviously we dug into all this in due diligence we want to be – part of the good thing about being in this business today is that we feel we can migrate a lot of the revenues and obtain the capital efficiencies but were trying to be very conservative around that so weve made some very very detailed bottoms up assumptions and across a variety of desks and that – generate that number warren warren gardiner okay thank you and then i guess obviously some real benefit from moving upstream on the retail front i mean any sense how should we maybe thinking about i guess sort of the accretion of the capture rate if you will on americas equities and then also maybe some color on – in europe i know there’s sort of an effort on kcg’s front there as well with respect to retail just over there douglas cifu yeah it’s a great question and as i tried to note in my prepared remarks this is not like a new business for us really what happened globally is you have segmentation of order flow and it’s done by different mechanisms and different regulatory regimes in the united states you have this well oiled machine if you will some people call payment order flow or wholesale market making whatever is and in europe and in asia it’s done differently so we participate in segmented markets globally in europe and in asia in particular and in those markets while we dont disclose individual capture rates for an all call market as opposed to a segmented market we can tell you just episodically if you will and obviously we track this by venue and by strategy that there is a meaningful difference as to how our strategies perform not surprisingly when theyre not in an all to all market but theyre in a segmented market and so translating that to the united states and to the kcg business we’re obviously very optimistic that having access to that order flow with our partners and new friends at kcg that we can significantly augment the experience that the customer has and also maximize our profitability as we interact with that i would also point out that the thing that we have done very well as a firm is really hone our entry and exit of positions when you dont have the benefit if you will of customer and institutional order flow when youre fighting in the all to all market youve got to be very acute and very good around technology understanding market structure and you have to have a low cost environment thats really been the virtu’s story right we dont have a competitive advantage in terms of having institutional and retail order flow on a large scale basis and so weve spent the  years since we started this firm really doing that thats the dna of this firm micro market structure scale efficiency kcg comes at this from a different point of view right which is theyve got this great customer franchises institutional and retail franchise that theyve had for two decades and they do a fantastic job at it in due diligence and just around the market theyre kind of the platinum standard if you will customer service and so theyre providing a service on the market making side were providing a service if you will on the market making side and theyre coming from the north were coming from the south and were sort of meeting at the equator right because at the end of the day youve seen this conversion of technology and efficiency in the marketplace and we think by combining the two were going to get one plus one equals three and thats really kind of the main strategic rationale for doing it certainly theres a lot of financial components and joe will go through all those and we put a lot of those in the deck but strategically this is a very important transformative situation for virtu i also would say on the agency side you mentioned europe one of the key motivators for us wanting to get into the agency execution business was obviously our experiences with order routing for our own selves and how that that value proposition really translated to the agency business now with the advent of mifid ii and unbundling it it just seems like the time is really right for a superior execution only agency offering really to be well accepted by the buy side and again through our due diligence and understanding the market and talking to customers and what not over the years we have a great deal of respect for the products that kcg has we developed some of our own products some of our proprietary tca and transparency products into the way that we route and we think again by marrying their great institutional client base and the great talents and skills that they have with our technologically advanced if you will order routing capabilities again we think on that side of the house we can develop a terrific product as well warren gardiner great thanks thats really helpful thats really helpful color i think just lastly for me i just think the answer is no but should we be thinking about any change to the dividend you know as you guys are sort of delevering or not is related but the tax structure as well douglas cifu yeah great question the tax structure will say the same and i think we put in the press release that theres no plan for changing dividend as well joseph molluso yeah douglas cifu thats obviously… warren gardiner okay i got… douglas cifu we’ve dealt with that in the capital structure and the – and our partners of jp morgan – and formulating the credit make sure that we have the ability to continue to pay the dividend warren gardiner great thanks a lot i appreciate it douglas cifu thank you warren operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of alex kramm ubs alex kramm yeah good morning everyone just wanted to come back to you’re guys entering the retail market making space maybe you’ve mentioned this at the beginning but obviously youre entering this business at a time where theres lot of price competition at the end market you’re seeing swap and others fees a lot and obviously that’s the lost revenue opportunity for those guys and you could argue that at some point that could trickle through to the market making community and in particular if you think youre going to make more money in trading the order flow some of those guys might want to share the upsides right so how do you feel comfortable that that business is not a race of zero in particular theres competition in the end market douglas cifu yeah its a great question and i think the way we do business is to be transparent and collaborative with our business partners weve done that throughout since we started virtu so obviously i need to get to know these folks i know some of them very well and i know the great folks at kcg that have interacted with them for years i have a terrific relationship with them i think this is a winwin for those customers because at the end of the day were going to bring the efficiency and scale that virtu is known for to that business and so we can make that a more efficient business and make it a better experience at the end of the day is there going to be an adult conversation about how does that shared and ultimately how does the end use of the retail and the institutional investor that are using the services of a schwab or et cetera how are they going to benefit from this thats really the most important thing we think we can drive execution quality we think we can continue to reduce cost because thats what we did – already kind of what we do weve been one of the proponents of competing at lower spreads and dealing with rising costs in the competitive all to all market so we think that this is a key moment in time for this segment of the business to get more efficient and to hone in skill so look at the end of the day were all adults we’re all in business to make money but at the end you need to provide a superior product to the end user and im very confident that this will be a winwin for the fantastic customer base at kcg alex kramm alright thank you that’s helpful and then just secondly i guess this is for joe can you talk a little bit more on the technology synergy as the indiscernible there i dont know kcg that well anymore but i feel like there were a lot of acquisitions and obviously get go kcg coming together a few years ago but from what i understand not much more integrated maybe theyre like four different training platforms or more so where are you heading i mean is the roadmap to find already is this going to be a virtu backbone over time or is one of those situation both wake up and you actually realized you cant integrate as much because you dont know what happens when you shutdown one system and theres a lot of risk involved so how comfortable are you with the technology movement and actually what are you seeing there internally that might be very efficient joseph molluso yeah look – when you look at how weve detailed the synergies weve broken out  million of technology communications and data processing synergies the first step there is just kind of identifying redundant paths – redundant telecommunication paths around the globe kcg has done a great job managing that and i think we’ve done a great job managing that and this is an area where you can literally look at contracts and services and data contracts and what they pay for market data what we pay for market data and there are just direct redundancies there and that’s what’s represented in that number so that  million that we called out is just cost savings associated with redundant technology infrastructure data processing that we think is very achievable it’s very similar to what virtu did when it acquired madison tyler in  i think to your point to know about the overall technology platform and systems i think that will be a phased process i think ultimately the goal is to have one technology platform but there are a lot of different areas to look at and i think they will build the benchmarks within  months  months  months  months but i think from the customer experience at kcg theres not going to be anything that changes in the nearterm or the intermediate term like there will be no overhaul of technology immediately that will change anything related to the important customer franchise douglas cifu yeah i think thats the most important point that joe just made which is as far as the customer experiences we get how important that is and that the interaction with the kcg environment right now is superior and we dont want to change that what happens behind the scenes if you will as behind the wall and we really always pride ourselves as you all know in having a single integrated platform that’s multiasset class multicurrency and you can – all of our offices in the way we operate are  seamless and interchangeable were going to bring that scale and efficiency to what kcg has to offer to the customers that will be behind the scenes if you will but absolutely at the end the day thats why we have been able to be as successful as we are in terms of having a scale plan alex kramm okay so if i hear you right the  million in technology savings is really just i guess the duplication in market data and there should probably be upside if we actually end up cleaning up the backbone did i hear you right there joe joseph molluso it’s duplicated market structure and its duplicated telecommunications yes alex kramm okay and then just one quickly at the end here as well in terms of the leverage you said you can delever quickly what do you think longterm this company should be running at in terms of leverage in multi… joseph molluso i think that today were around  to  and thats where we think we had to alex kramm all right joseph molluso so based on – if you look at our leverage profile today we did a refinancing of our debt in the fall and our message was that this is the right longterm leverage level for the company and i think what weve identified is a month path here month path where we can return to that proper capital structure alex kramm all right that’s it from me then thank you douglas cifu thank you very much operator and your next question comes from the line of christian bolu credit suisse christian bolu hello joseph molluso good morning christian christian bolu good morning apologies if i missed this but could you talk about what the cost to achieve synergies and then fully integrated kcg are joseph molluso yeah the cost to achieve synergies here we havent outlined them we will naturally be – as we achieve these synergies around telecommunications around occupancy and leases were going to be having kind of a onetime writeoff so we havent fully identified the total charge and separated that between cash or noncash but i will tell you as a rule of thumb something that is in between half and  and  of the fully phasedin run rate as a onetime charge would not surprise me christian bolu okay and thats a cash charge that that… joseph molluso no it will be cash and noncash it will be cash and noncash christian bolu can you give the splits of cash and noncash i’m really trying to understand the cash bit joseph molluso we’ll be providing more detail on that i think the noncash part will be the greater number christian bolu okay joseph molluso noncash part will be the greater number just because as you capitalize longterm leases and as you capitalize real estate and things like that those numbers tend to be bigger and then as you cancel contracts or if you have any reductions in force the way weve modeled it anyway that’s the smaller part of it and those tend to be the cash items christian bolu okay thanks and can you just help me understand why you raised  million equity and  billion in debt to fund  billion deal whats the delta between… joseph molluso delta is our – we’re refinancing so the delta is that two companies have  billion of debt on them today so we have to refinance both of those pieces of debt and so the incremental – so you have your numbers right christian but just think of the debt as an incremental  million christian bolu got you okay that’s helpful and then the  accretion just unclear that does include – that does factoring the impact of the equity offering right joseph molluso it does it does christian bolu okay perfect and just lastly – and i think you tried to mention – you didn’t talk about this earlier on i guess one could argue again to how exactly the same thesis or very similar thesis to you when it’s kcg and profitability has been somewhat tough maybe just help me understand very big picture wise whats different this time how you’d approach the integrating – to come to a better or longterm outcome douglas cifu i wasnt there and i have no real idea obviously i read from the news clippings and things like that that you did all i know is how we operate and how im going to approach this transaction and to be blunt we have a lot more to learn from kcg then kcg has to learn from us and these guys have been in a tremendous business and have served the market ably for two decades and so were going to go in there very humbly and say guys we really want to understand how you will operate we think we can help you make it better and lets be collaborative and work together we are a lean and mean management team here it’s joe and myself and some other folks sitting in this conference room were not going to go in there guns blazing and say its our way at our highway were going to go in and really try to learn and be collaborative im  convinced that there are literally hundreds of very very talented people at kcg that will kind of get the way that we want to run this business we’ll be excited about creating a truly integrated financial services firm and we think that we can build the bestinclass marketmaking and agency business that can be competitive and that can be sustainable and can provide a better customer experience and most importantly for our investors we’ll continue to drive significant margins and profitability so thats kind of the best that we can do which is to be humble to try to learn and try to get the best out of both firms and integrate them in the right way we’ve had the experience of doing that with madison tyler which was a very significant marketmaking firm that we merged with in  and the most important thing that i learned from that transaction is its not often that – its not virtu and madison tyler it’s us and so at the end of day its not going to be virtu and kcg and i dont care where you came from the best people will be promoted the best people will be on the management committee and the best people will continue to grow and learn with the firm as i will so were really looking forward to the experience christian bolu okay thank you very much for the detailed answer douglas cifu thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of chris allen buckingham chris allen good morning guys douglas cifu good morning chirs joseph molluso hi chris allen apologies if i missed – missed some of this in redundant but i just had a couple of different questions one the  accretion is that for fiscal  or  i am just trying to… joseph molluso the way we presented here in the deck chris is really what weve tried to do is say look you have your own view of virtu you have your own view of kcg no matter what scenario you model the moving pieces are going to be kind of what is the net cost savings and what is the incremental interest expense so naturally if you modeled it right out of the box where we havent paid down net debt in the first quarter its still accretive but what weve done here is say look on a fully phasedin what’s the right capital structure scenario it is over  accretion so the example weve given on page  it says its  which shows  just because its the full second year and were assuming we closed in q but it doesnt have to be you can pick any year you can plugin any numbers you want that youll come up with for kcg and virtu and when you plugin the synergy number even with higher amounts of incremental interest expense it is meaningfully accretive chris allen so you’re using  consensus is that right for the  joseph molluso yes i mean if you’re plugging  consensus i think you’re going to get something even higher chris allen okay and then just kind of the – i know it’s two years the fully phasedin synergies i’m just trying to think about how that kind of liked that in over those two years kind of – i mean how long is the development work needed on your side to be able to implement the kcg strategies or are do you utilizing some of those i’m just trying to reconcile that to kind of make sure were not going too quickly in terms of the synergy build outs joseph molluso i think just in terms of the actual number that that we put out there it’s like chris simplifying assumption that that would work is just   year one and then  in year two douglas cifu and chris just a little more color on i think there are a lot of things that are going to be day one like we obviously dont have to pay my favorite topic market data fees and things like that those are day one tiering benefits those are day one consolidating flow within legal entities to reduce brokerage costs those are all day one weve a lot of experience from having done that in the madison tyler virtu transaction where we saw a lot of those day one synergies obviously terming out telecommunication lines and colos and whatnot reducing footprints migrating strategy on to a single box so that you can reduce a footprint in a very expensive colo those arent necessarily day one maybe they are day  to day  depending upon the term of the actual lease or colocation facility but theyre easily identifiable in terms of technology and replatform what i would point out is that here at virtu we have a lot of experience being a technology service provider we have an arrangement with a large financial situation on the fx side and then our much ballyhooed arrangement with jp morgan where effectively we are routing risk for jp morgan in the fixed income world and the us treasury’s world right so its not entirely just similar to the situation that were going to be faced with from an architectural perspective in the kcg environment where theyve got this great host of strategies that are very very complementary to what we do in the customer market making segment they access the market in a particular way we are very good at accessing markets we’re really fundamentally a terrific smart order router as a firm so taking those intentions those orders from kcg and routing them through a virtu environment is something that will be very high on our list and we have realtime experience if you will by doing that as a technology provider already with our friends at jp morgan so they were terrific test case in terms of how do you access the market when your strategy if you will is now actually coming up with the idea to place a particular order on a particular side of a particular product so its going to take a little bit of time to do that but were very confident in our ability to do that weve already done that as i said before with madison tyler and weve done it with a large global financial institution so in looking at the architecture kcg we think we can get that done relatively quickly chris allen got it and then just digging a little on the  million of capital synergies you talked about rationalizing noncore businesses does that include potential sale of bondpoint douglas cifu no and to be blunt i mean i dont know a lot about bondpoint other than obviously what ive read i haven’t met the people and strategically i have to really understand how it fits in to their customer base and how it makes sense i mean its a terrific asset obviously i dont know if they do separate financials on it whatnot so i’m not going to talk about those here but the results that i have seen and the growth that i have seen is really a terrific asset and a great product i understand the market somewhat in terms of credit and credit platforms i think its a market leader and what it does i think its got a lot of potential can we augment the customer experience this through technology through this that or the other thing im not sure but joe myself the guys at virtu we will be very collaborative with the folks at kcg that have the most experience in particular we never want to do anything that that has any impact at all in the negative fashion on the customer segments they have so do their customers rely on it how important is that so were going to make that strategic assessment all i know is it’s a very very impressive asset and these guys have done a great job running it they really have chris allen okay and then indiscernible  million of capital synergy seems to be a pretty big number to me joseph molluso yes chris allen joe you can buckle down between the three bullets you kind of listed in the page  like whats – how that’s broken down between those just i mean if we were to sell bondpoint i would say no problem you can get it done very easily but kind of question that number now a little bit joseph molluso yes so just to complete the bondpoint answering bondpoint really doesnt use any meaningful capital chris allen all right no it just – it can be sold for decent amount of money so… joseph molluso yes so – no no yeah so thats not included here and look – chris a lot of this is kind of in a very very detailed due diligence but there are a number of areas weve got consolidating businesses within virtu i think what that means is kind of we’ve got legal entities – regulated legal entities in europe and in asia and in the us as they do right so you achieve capital synergies when you move businesses into our own legal entities all right we got a separate legal entity setup for proprietary trading and agency trading in europe all right were going to achieve capital synergies there there are a number of things that we dug into in terms of how much capital is used to support different debts and different businesses that are going to be consolidated or rationalized and weve done a very granular very kind of position by position bottoms up analysis of capital usage and the impact on revenue so some of that revenue dissynergy is a result of this but we’ve applied a very kind of virtu like lens in terms of appropriate returns on capital and this is what weve come up with chris allen okay that’s it from me guys thanks joseph molluso thank you chris i think operator anymore questions i don’t believe there are operator there are no further questions at this time sir joseph molluso great thank you everybody we appreciate everybody assembling on such short notice and again we really look forward to continue to discuss how this important and accretive transaction will evolve virtu and for my friends at kcg i will be down there later today i

call over to doug douglas cifu thank you andrew good morning and thank you all for joining our call this morning to discuss virtus fourth quarter and full year results i am very pleased to report that our global business performed well in the fourth quarter of  for the quarter virtu reported adjusted net trading income of  million and  per share of adjusted eps the fourth quarter was really a tale of two quarters october volumes and volatility were similar to the third quarter which was marked by a low volume and mute volatility environment the us presidential election in early november brought us some much welcome change to market conditions as we saw an uptick in demand for our market making services across all of our asset classes globally and these positive conditions carried on through the first half of december although the year end was characteristically quiet we are generally pleased with virtus solid performance and profitability in this quarter and the full year  given the overall market conditions we could not have achieved the consistently profitable results in this quarter or the full year of  without our diversified global and scale platform which continues to perform well in all market conditions and as well our relentless focus on cost despite the challenges of a mixed operating environment during much of  i believe the first full year as a public company for virtu was successful in several respects first we maintained what we believe are bestinclass margins for market making firm despite the mixed operating environment and the additional cost and expenses associated with operating as a public company secondly we broke ground on expanding our technology offerings by launching our technologically driven agency execution business and entering into an agreement with j p morgan to provide outsourced technology and market structure expertise to a part of their us trading operations next we acquired a minority stake in japannext and expanded our footprint in the increasingly important asia pacific region as the yearoveryear growth in our apac equities business demonstrated next we acquired strategic telecommunications assets from a trading firm allowing us to stay on the forefront of technological developments in our industry while maintaining cost discipline also although there were a number of notable events on the regulatory front we saw no material negative impact to virtus business from anything in the regulatory environment and in fact the finalized method to regulation for example should be a strong positive for our business going forward we are optimistic about  and believe with the new pro growth and pro business environment in washington that the stage is set for the return to a more normalized volume and volatility environment globally and a more sensible regulatory and enforcement environment as such we look forward to creating more value for our shareholders in  now let me touch on some thoughts related to our business the environments of  and some strategic initiatives underway at virtu with regard to the operating environment it is worth noting that as a technologically enabled market making firm virtus business thrives as natural buyers and sellers in each of the  plus marketplaces that we connect to in  countries trade in series of elevated anticipated or actual volatilities these interactions tend to be more frequent and therefore more profitable measures of anticipated volatility like the vix and realized volatility were particularly low in the fourth quarter and in particular for the entire second half of  looking ahead we see reasons to be optimistic with several underlying factors that have the potential to create favorable levels of trading activity including changes in fed and global central banks policies and the changing regulatory and tax environment that will allow banks and other market participants to increase their trading activity in addition as a fully diversified market making firm global geopolitical uncertainties both scheduled and unscheduled will continue to lead to enhanced marketmaking opportunities for us across markets turning to some strategic initiatives we in started  ill first talk about our initiatives to offer virtus superior routing capabilities to the buy side in equities those of you who follow virtu noticed this has got underway around the time of our ipo when we responded to critics of socalled hft by engaging directly with various market participants we demonstrated how virtu operates with our passive marketmaking approach in a nonconflicted and technologically enabled manner i am pleased to report that we now have multiple buy side clients up and running sending us order flow every day we have a meaningful queue of customers to onboard and our onboarding client in europe as well we believe that the european approach of requiring unbundling of agency services as mandated by mifid ii will only make our nonconflicted routing capabilities more attractive to the buy side more importantly from our perspective the feedback we have received from our customers to date has been outstanding as you know this is a competitive marketplace and so far the early feedback we have received fits squarely with how we see the business evolving we began this business not to compete with longestablished market participants who can offer a variety of products and services to clients but to create an offering with superior capabilities and analytics that we can service in a virtu way without incurring meaningful startup cost and profitably operating from day one with regard to technology services we continue to be excited about the prospects for this business in the ongoing discussions we are having with potential customers we believe the time is right for an efficient multiasset class technological platform like virtu to be sought after by global financial institutions concerned about future technology spent the agreement we signed with jp morgan in july for example is up and running and from our standpoint is working quite well we see great longterm potential with this arrangement based on our early interactions we have also been approached by other global financial institutions that seek to understand how our technology global scale and understanding of markets and market structure might help their businesses and we will continue to explore partnerships like these that enhance shareholder value turning to our investment in sbi japannext we stated when we made this acquisition that it was a meaningful opportunity for virtu to increase its footprint in asia so far we are very pleased with the investment we view the market structure in this part of the world as evolving favorably for us although we are not generally disposed to make strategic investments japannext has given us the opportunity to have a front row seat participating in and influencing this change in that part of the world we view japannext as the top tcs ph in japan run by a worldclass management team and has provided us a unique opportunity to provide our marketmaking services in a large established market with a toptier business partner these interactions contributed to the  growth of our apac equities business from  through  which is an impressive growth in a challenged environment finally we announced in the fourth quarter our intention to purchase strategic assets telecommunications assets from a trading firm we are excited about this acquisition for several reasons first it is an example of how the competitive environment in our industry favors largescale global firm like virtu that firms decision to shift its focus and unwind its proprietary business in favor of an asset management model is a great example of the scale required to compete second the assets we are acquiring are worldclass and will allow us to maintain our superior technological footprint in a costeffective way and third along with the purchase we acquired professionals that are already working in virtu in this area we think  was a positive year for the ongoing market structure debate in the united states and globally a few areas to note first we view the tick pilot as a real success as a marketmaker we have been able to provide more depth of book and quote more names included in the tick pilot second we remain supportive of the recent approaches for the new york stock exchange and the chicago stock exchange around new speedbump proposals as i said in the prior call we particularly applauded the constructive solution put forth by the chicago stock exchange which we believe would promote greater liquidity and price discovery by protecting the markets liquidity from market participants solely seeking to opportunistically profit from shortterm price fluctuations we also support the ongoing discussions around the efficacy and necessity of our existing order protection and market access perform and remain committed to working with regulators and other market participants in this area in particular we are focused on the recent debate around market data and the current system around selling market data we continue to believe that there is something fundamentally wrong with how the current system works and the regulators endorsement of global exchange economic models based on charging market participants like virtu for data that we create in a somewhat noncompetitive fashion outside of us equities we continue to support realtime trace reporting of us treasuries to bring needed transparency to this and finally we welcome the opportunity to work with the cftc and acting commissioner giancarlo in implementing a very sensible regulation  ph overall we believe that the change of administration and attitude towards markets in washington will be a strong positive for our business in  and beyond despite the mixed environment that persisted for much of  we have reason to be very optimistic about the future ill turn to some specific comments about the fourth quarter before turning the call over to joe for more review and then of course your questions our americas equities category turned in a strong performance in the fourth quarter our average daily results were up  despite volumes up only  and realized volatility coming in  lower than q our european equities category performed similarly well together these categories were  and  of our adjusted net trading income overall for the full year  while we had a slower quarter in apac  was a banner year for our apac equities category we completed the aforementioned japannext investment expanded our footprint and improved our trading our apac category contributed  overall to our  results and we are very pleased with this progress as you know our global fx business has borne the brunt of this recent challenging environment we saw improvement in our results in the fourth quarter and are optimistic as ever about the future of our fx business after making significant infrastructures and other investments in  venues more focused on spot volumes which are more pertinent to virtus business experienced mixed volume results in the fourth quarter and most were up only modestly while volatility remained quite low our average daily results in the fourth quarter were up  versus the prior quarter which outpaced the volumes in the quarter so we are very pleased with this performance our commodities business results in q you will recall included a trading gain from a prior settlement of  million so including the  million revenue our global commodities business was generally flat from the prior quarter and in line with volume expectations finally as joe will outline we kept our promise to our investors by managing our expenses during  in addition our board decided on  per share dividend payable to shareholders of record on march   making a total of  per share that we have returned to our investors since our april  ipo as i have repeatedly said our board and management team remains committed to returning capital to our shareholders and as such i have seen no reason whatsoever why this policy would be altered in  now well turn the call over to joe to provide more detail on our results joe joseph molluso thank you gaap net income for virtu financial inc after attribution to noncontrolling interest was  million which equates to  per share of diluted gaap eps consistent with the financial presentation and our quarterly and annual results since our ipo we provide nongaap financial information to supplement our presentation on a nongaap basis our normalized net income was  million for the fourth quarter assuming  million fully converted shares outstanding this equated to  per share in normalized adjusted eps our adjusted ebitda which excludes the impact of stockbased compensation and other items was  million for the quarter with a corresponding margin of  turning to revenues in the overall environment for the fourth quarter our total adjusted net trading income was  million down  versus the fourth quarter of  and up by  versus the third quarter on a fullyear basis adjusted net trading income came in at  million down from the record high of  million in  on a daily basis adjusted net trading income was  million per day in q there were  trading days in q of  for the second year in a row the americas equities category earned the largest share of adjusted net trading income with  of the total for  the fourth quarter was particularly strong for americas and emea equities compared to the third quarter and given the overall environment on a share volume basis us consolidated equity volumes were up  versus the prior quarter and emea notional value traded was up  americas equities and emea equities results were up  and  respectively versus q we are pleased with these results particularly in light of the continued overall poor environment for a market maker like virtu the average mix was up slightly in q to  from  in q however realized volatility was down from an already very depressed level in q further the ratio of realized volatility to anticipated volatility as measured by vix was down as well to  the lowest in some time the story is similar in europe where implied volatility and realized volatility were both down versus q in the apac equities category we ended  with a record  million of adjusted net trading income the poor overall environment impacted the results of q however we are very pleased with the overall progress of this region which contributed  of adjusted net trading income in  turning to foreign exchange and commodities q was a mixed bag although we saw overall improvement and entered  on a positive note our commodities results were flat versus q when you exclude this settlement trading gain included in the q results with regard to foreign exchange foreign exchange volumes were generally poor in q cme futures contracts and notional amount of trade were up however more pertinent spot volumes were generally down and in some cases meaningfully down depending on the venue as doug mentioned our review on the underlying factors that drive volume and volatility is bullish however given the unpredictable nature of the operating environment we strive to operate virtu to be solidly profitable in all market environments to do this we maintain a policy of strong expense discipline and focus on cash flow generation our expense management continued to reflect our discipline and we think demonstrates our ability to adjust to the environment despite the challenging conditions our profit margins continue to be among the best of our peer companies we focus on adjusted ebitda margin and for the fourth quarter and fullyear  our adjusted ebitda margin was  and  respectively on our core expenses which we include as communications and data processing employee compensation operations and administration and depreciation and amortization were  million for the fourth quarter and  million for the full year we define these categories as core expenses because they represent the fixed cost of operating our business and are therefore somewhat within our control as opposed to brokerage and clearing type expenses with we embed in our trading profits to derive an adjusted net trading income on a full year basis these core expenses were down  versus full year  drilling down into the categories our global telecommunications and market data cost came in at  million up about  from the prior year and in line with expectations our operations and administrative expenses were down and our depreciation and amortization line item decreased from  million in  to  million in  we achieved these outcomes with regard to these noncompensation related expense categories through active management relentless reviews of our business and requirements particularly related to technology and market data but also with regard to facilities operations benefits all aspects of our business active management is particularly important with regard to compensation expense looking at the results for fullyear  our total gaap compensation expense including stock based compensation declined from  million to  million excluding stockbased compensation compensation costs were  million down from  million in  we were able to achieve these results while transitioning to a public company style equity incentive compensation plan for our employees managing our total headcount which was  as of today while expanding into new businesses and making sure our employees are well compensated and properly incentivized the only other notable expense item is the write off of certain expenses related to the refinancing of our longterm debt as i mentioned on our last call we took advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance our debt and when you do this we are required to take a noncash charge writing off expenses related mainly to the unamortized expenses from the previous term loan and you can see that number is  million for this quarter as you know the debt refinancing was very successful for virtu resulting in an extension of the maturity to  the reduction in our libor spread by  basis points and decrease in our weighted average interest costs so we were very happy with this outcome turning to cash and capital we provide some updated supplemental materials for your review as we did last quarter our cash and capital position remained strong providing more than adequate capital to run our business and maintain an acceptable cushion at december  we had cash and equivalents of  million net cash was  million we look at trading capital together with net cash and as you can see our trading capital position at december  was  million given the passive market neutral approach we have we do not require substantial amounts of capital to hold or management risk positions you can see this analysis on slide six of the supplemental materials if you look at our ebitda and income numbers in relation to these capital numbers you can see that virtu earns consistently exceptional returns on capital for example even in the challenging conditions of  we generated  million of adjusted ebitda using yearend trading capital number of  million this translates to a  return on deployed capital from a cash flow standpoint we report normalized adjusted net income and eps to assume that our company is a fully taxed ecorporation with all of the common units exchange for class a and b shares in the company we feel this is a helpful presentation in order to get a picture of our cashbased results on slide four as we did last quarter we have adjusted various items that generate or use cash and as you can see the cumulative impact is that we generated  per share of normalized adjusted free cash flow and declared cumulative dividends of  per share since our ipo we have paid out  of our pro forma earnings since ipo if we cash adjust these earnings we paid out  of our normalized adjusted free cash flow when discussing our payout during our ipo we communicated our intent to keep the payout at least  of our earnings finally our board of directors has authorized a regular quarterly distribution of  per share payable march  to shareholders of record on march  now i will turn the call back to the operator for your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from rich repetto with sandler o’neill your line is open richard repetto yes good morning doug good morning joe douglas cifu good morning rich joseph molluso good morning richard repetto yes i guess the first question is what stands out is the adjusted margins  close to  and i guess the question is and it has been asked before but given the environment why dont your strategies struggle like some of your competitors that were seeing actual losses quarterly losses douglas cifu well that’s obviously rich i know what we do right so it’s hard for me to comment on how other firms run their business or what their strategies do and why they react to volatility and rising markets or falling markets in different ways my theory is and ive articulated this many times we’re a pure market making firm right so we dont have an axe if you will what were – our mission is to be the finest increment of the bid and offer and to have a price at every moment in time for the  financial instruments that we trade we do that by reference obviously the publicly available market data understanding market structure and having a great technology plan that’s our mission singly focused its what benny was doing  years ago in the trading fit the story and we use technology and scale to provide that efficiency in to the marketplace so as a pure market making firm candidly you should make money in rising and falling markets now obviously youll make more money when there is more volume and many times you can make more money as you see in this quarter where there are periods of volatility or increased interest where the bid offer spread will expand but our mission and our focus and our job if you will is to be a service provider to provide the financial intermediation in the most efficient way between natural buyers and natural sellers when you do that and you stick to your knitting and you are consistent and you manage your cost and expenses which joe just went through which we did frankly you should be profitable every quarter as we have been since our inception in since we started trading in  richard repetto understood thats helpful and i guess doug you did talk a fair amount about the growth initiatives adding several new buy side clients and optimistic in  i guess the question is is there any way to put some sort of quantitative how much can this contribute either on a percentage basis or just trying to feel what possible impact it could have on the financials in the coming year the gross initiatives being the buy side and the partnerships with jp morgan et cetera douglas cifu yes now look obviously i get it and i know you guys and our investors obviously want to see how can we size that opportunity how can we grow we do separately disclose in our technology services segment that kind of we’ve got a couple of technology deals and obviously now we have an agency business so it all kind of get’s lumped in there and we get at the right moment in time as that business grows we’ll provide more detailed color on it but i stick with the comments and the statements that ive made on these calls and in other public forum which is we think that’s a meaningful opportunity weve had great takeup from worldclass institutions that frankly we’re very humbled to be in business with and you know some of the names that have been out there in the press and in terms of sizing it we think it can certainly be  of our overall results now the one thing that im not going to get boxed into is to say hey how is that going to scale out quarterbyquarter and i get it it’s important for the modelling and what not and people to look at the evaluation and im cognizant and respectful of that but we think this is a real opportunity and we’ve had great uptake and i think the thing that i want people to be focused on is like we are running those businesses as it were two business we have it ramped up with hiring a bunch of new employees and scale and new technology we havent made any meaningful investments in there because we frankly dont have to what we have discovered is that we are a great financial technology company that really understands market structure because we have to make markets in these markets and so i think thats a very unique asset if you will that we have and the business partners that we are now doing business with who are very discerning consumers and have frankly their choice to any financial technology company out there in the world recognize that differentiation we’re not going to be commoditized we’re not going to be the cheapest option but if you want a firm that really has built a great technological plan is very efficient is on the cutting edge but really also understands  plus markets in  countries we might be the guy to do business with and so we think that value proposition does scale it does scale in a virtu way and well continue to pound it and hopefully you’ll see the quarter results increase richard repetto thanks that’s all i had doug and joe and good luck in  douglas cifu thank you rich operator thank you our next question comes from chris allen with buckingham research your line is open chris allen hey guys how are you doing and i guess we can just start on cash equities business if you could just give us may be some color in terms of what drove the performance relative to i mean we kind of look at the realized volatility metric i don’t know if there is strength in etfs or some other element there and also how the start to  is so far douglas cifu yes i mean thanks chris good question i think obviously when i said it in my comments i mean the somewhat i guess the price i don’t want this to be a political comment because it’s not the surprise election of president trump and the ripple effects of that obviously had a very positive impact on our us equities business during the quarter i think the significant thing about that event was unlike brexit which was limited to a day or two or three chris we did see a significant interest and uptick if you will in our marketmaking services as it is obviously seen by the results and the increased capture rate and all the other stuff that you guys will model out during the quarter and again as a leading and you hit it right on the head as a leading etf market maker when youve got people shifting portfolios when youve got people particularly on the night of the elections but also the next five six ten trading days thereafter making fundamental decisions on what does this mean for my portfolio and a lot of that is driven by etp products that we happen to be very active in and very efficient in that’s going to have a significant impact on our operating results in a particular segment in a particular quarter so it’s really that was really the offshoot of it and again it’s just beat the drum again that’s the business model like try to be everywhere and be the best fit and the best offer in all these different asset classes in geographies and youll get rewarded obviously we saw an uptick in the fx business as well some of that was related to the improvements and the investments that weve made in terms of personnel and technology but also obviously the ripple effects from the trump presidency certainly helped that business january has been interesting obviously coming off the increased volumes in volatilities in november and the first couple of weeks of december we were anticipating that january would hopefully be a more active month you guys see the numbers and whatnot i think theres been a fair degree of uncertainty as to where the trump presidency policies will come out in the areas of tax in particular and maybe some of the regulatory structure so that uncertainty i think unfortunately has meant that there is less natural buyers and natural sellers and less portfolio shifting in the market and you guys see the volumes in january which have been somewhat muted and not as not as robust as we saw in november but its still very early days in the quarter and im an optimistic guy by nature but certainly january you guys see the numbers from all the exchanges have been somewhat lower than what we saw in november and in the first part of december chris allen got it that’s it from me guys thanks douglas cifu thank you chris operator thank you our next question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs your line is open alex blostein hey guys good morning douglas cifu good morning alex blostein i was hoping you could give us an update on the jp morgan relationship i think its been a couple quarters since the announcement came out i think in the past you guys talked about expanding into potentially other asset classes there as well so may be just an update on how thats gone so far and what sort of next we should expect from that relationship douglas cifu well look as with every relationship youve got to date a little bit before you get engaged before you get married so i think look i mean they are terrific people i think the great results have been i think culturally and ergonomically the firms fit very very well together obviously there was a period where we had to get our systems to speak and compliance and all that kind of stuff thats all now behind us and were actively engaged in working with them to enhance their marketmaking capabilities and in active treasuries and what not im really not going to comment on kind of where it goes from there i mean i think it’s way too early days alex i mean we’re humbled and honoured to be candid with you to be in business with such an important financial institution weve learned a lot from them and hope theyve learned a lot from us in terms of how they operate and i think theyve hopefully learned on how a smaller may be more nimble firm operates so i think theres a lot of great synergies there but in terms of where the relationship goes i think its still early days i mean we’ve got a multiyear relationship with them multiyear partnership it does you know its represented in our financial results where youll see some uptick in  but i think it’s again and i’ve said this on multiple calls i think its a great sign of how large terrific financial institutions that have customers and capital and all the wonderful things that banks have can partner with very nimble financial technology firms that happens in our market structure very well so i continue to be very enthused about the partnership alex blostein got it thanks my other quick question was just around the tax reform and obviously it’s early days and nobody quite knows where things will shake out but for you guys specifically given the obvious new structure and kind of the way you account for taxes on an adjusted basis if the tax rate were to go down to something lets say in the mids range can you give us a sense i guess like how that would impact your adjusted results and then more importantly how does that impact the way you think about the spreads i guess whether your competitiveness on the pricing side meaning that does that create a special opportunity because you guys have a lot of scale already and section enables you to provide pricing i guess in a tighter spread douglas cifu yes in my prior life i used to be a lawyer pretend i was a great tax lawyer but i actually wasnt so i’m actually going to ask joe to give a better answer than i could on what it means for our tax rate joseph molluso no you are right alex if the corporate tax rate all things being equal goes from the statutory rate  to a statutory rate of  we will benefit from that by  in terms of how we book taxes i think the devil is always in the details and we presented on a pro forma basis because we think that’s the right way to do it and we think it – the right way to value the company is to assume we’re not in a structure and where it fully taxed ccorp so we would see no reason to generally the statutory rate is kind of where your effective rate hovers and we would expect that we would be right around the new statutory rate and i know theres a lot of detail lot of things being discussed about having more to do with manufacturing companies probably in a company like that but we would we would welcome our public company as a ccorp and pays s corporate taxes so we would welcome that lower rate douglas cifu the only other comment joe i would make is i should point out our offshore operations are based in two lower corporate tax rate jurisdictions so were in ireland and in singapore and both those rates are  and singapore  or  dependent upon what the category is so as a global company if the new washington if you will lowered the corporate tax rates to  to  it really would help us as well because our offshore profits are below that so we would have to move things around and restructure and i think you also asked like how has it impacted the bid offer i mean i think one of the things that does not get talked about is there is actually a financial transaction tax in the united states it is called the section  fee they call it a fee not a tax but ill tell you what it is a tax it definitely impacts where we can make bid offer spread and it impacts our profitability it shows up in our variable expense line so people don’t talk about a lot but its pretty significant i know it allegedly goes to fund the sec and the excess goes to the “treasury” but it is a big part of the bid offer spread and candidly if that fee was reduced in a new administration with the new sec chairman taking a look at it i mean that would actually help our us equity results considerably alex blostein got it that’s very helpful thanks guys douglas cifu yes thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from ken worthington with jp morgan your line is open ken worthington hi good morning as we think about  and the fx business maybe talk a little bit about what are your priorities for kind of continuing to get that business to recover ntr is still sort of well below levels of experience over the last couple of years i guess maybe how are you thinking about adjusting to both the ongoing market structure changes that the fx environment is sort of going through and then adjusting to just the lower levels of volatility are there other things you can kind of invest in and due to kind of grow ntr to those prior levels douglas cifu yes good question and i think the further like i’ll say fragmentation efficiency the fx market actually is something that does will and does favor a firm like virtu one of the things that we did in  and we’ve seen some success already was further automate and scale that business five years ago six years ago when we were trading fx and i have said this publicly and privately before was we had access for cash platforms and the cme scroll forward to  and there is literally dozens of platforms and brokers that we can make markets to for further dissemination of our price and our product offering has scaled considerably so applying for virtu automation and regular if you will to that asset class thats something that we really focused on in  and we started to see some of the benefits in  i think as that asset class becomes more transparent as you see more competitors as you perhaps see more kind of realtime price dissemination as if you actually saw some type of centralized clearing again i’m speculating there is nothing in the works all of those things ken in terms of market structure are going to benefit virtu because it’s going to start to feel a lot more like an equity style business than more of a bilateral spoke type of business and that’s obviously very good for uss i think some of the other regulatory challenges like were a significant market maker in the swaps products if that becomes easier and under doddfrank to do onshore in a competitive stuff environment it is not that easy to do right now it’s one of the unintended consequences i think of doddfrank i think that could be a significant uptick to us so expanding the repertoire of pairs that we effectively make markets in maybe some ill call it sensible reformation of doddfrank to enable more competition i think there are a lot of unintended consequences in the fx market around doddfrank i think people can look at that and say hey this really probably wasnt the driver of the financial crisis and doddfrank has made it more difficult and more challenging for both dealers and nondealer market makers to participate in certain type of products so if there is some sensible reformation i’ll say at washington that’s probably positive to our business but again this is not a business where we’re going to go directly to buy side counterparties we were very comfortable with the relationships we have with the big dealers we’re not going to scale out and have a sales force and all that kind of stuff i think there is a lot of room for a very efficient market maker like virtu to take our prices and effectively redistribute them through business partners whether we call it banks technology providers or exchanges or ecns whatever you want to call them there is a lot of room for growth there ken worthington great thank you very much douglas cifu thank you operator thank you our next question comes from william katz with citigroup your line is open jack keeler this is jack keeler filling in for bill thanks for taking the questions this morning douglas cifu yes good morning jack keeler first one on the technology services business you mentioned youve had conversations with other financial institutions just kind of curious how much of this has been you guys still being inbound calls versus reaching out to these institutions and i know you just mentioned about the sales force i know it’s kind of an unvirtu thing to do but do you have any dedicated salespeople and is that something you would think about doing in the future douglas cifu yes i mean i guess on the lean salesman of virtu not to be too flipping but no again there aren’t it is not like there are  customers i mean you could probably name on one or two hands the large financial institutions i think the great news is because were in the market and because we have relationships with your employer and just in every employer that’s on the phone and others that we do business with either as a trading partner or prime brokerage customer over the years and we have those relationships so these were all inbound calls because obviously when there is noise around us entering into arrangements and doing various things i think that raises eyebrows in corridors in the institutions and people say hey i want to know what’s going on might this make sense for me to do something as well and so i think our reputation with most or all these financial institutions is stellar because we are transparent fully regulated market maker and weve had really good business relationships with these folks over the years so these aren’t commoditized products were looking for strong strategic partnerships i know im being vague intentionally but you kind of get it which is large institutions look at the efficiency scale and market structure expertise that we can bring those are areas within large financial institutions that i understand having talked to executives at these financial institutions where they are kind of trying to figure out what they do and how they can become more efficient in providing services to their customers we’re all trying to solve the same problem which is markets are getting more efficient and endusers are demanding efficiency in pricing it seems like a natural fit because we as a general matter dont have customers dont have relationships with the buy side dont have research don’t have ipo accounts all those wonderful things that large financial institutions have and have developed over frankly centuries it would be silly for us to try to compete with that and we would never do that but how can you marry the efficiency scale and market structure expertise that we have with all the fantastic things that a large financial institution can bring weve done that now in a couple of instances and might there be opportunity to do that again absolutely jack keeler got it thanks and what are your thoughts can you give any is there any color you could give on the pipeline for future technology services deals is this something that you have conversations ongoing or is it in the future if more came out you would be interested in doing it douglas cifu i mean they are certainly ongoing as i said in my script which means that were in talks with people they are at various stages though hey tell me what you guys do does it make sense to let’s try something out so you could see it this might work again i don’t want to sit here and promise and say we’re going to sign up two of them in  and this and that what ive said is this is not going to be a couple of dozen of business partners were a small firm and when we do these things we do them very intensely because we want to prove that we can really provide value to the business partners this isn’t a question of setting up some commoditized technology algo licensing kind of business there are plenty of firms that do that and i assume do it very very well what we can offer is really a holistic understanding of technology and market structure which we think is kind of unique because i feel the way that we make money understanding the markets and being really efficient and if we can partner with somebody that needs that efficacy and understanding in a very very efficient not off the shelf kind of manner and we think it  and it works for them and it works for us we’ll do it but again im not going to sit here and promise that it will be x y and z over the next number of quarters because i think that would candidly be irresponsible joseph molluso and remember just as you look at this as you look at our financials as you see as we pointed out the technology services is where these revenues develop and the agency execution piece of it were developed hopefully in a more steady way as we kind of onboard customers as and thats just the equity agency execution piece i think what you are asking about is more the technology servicesoutsourcing which by nature is going to be lumpier jack keeler got it thanks guys and then joe just a question for you obviously the expense for access ph was pretty strong yearoveryear in  and while it was a pretty challenging environment if you see a similar environment in  was there any kind of delayed spend or delayed investment  that you are planning to use in  instead or could you kind of stay at kind of run rate levels as the environment challenged joseph molluso the answer to your question is no there is not anything that we that we did not report on expenses any deferred expenses any delayed expenses and i would say emphatically yes we can maintain the run rate and we will do what we have to do adjust the environment even if it got worse so we do have continued for us and we feel strongly youve got to be able to make money in all kinds of environments including the quite core environment in the third quarter and fourth quarter jack keeler got it thanks for taking my questions guys douglas cifu thank you jack operator thank you and i am showing no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back to mr douglas cifu for any closing remarks douglas cifu thank you
