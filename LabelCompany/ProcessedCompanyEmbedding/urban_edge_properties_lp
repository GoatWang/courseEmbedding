limited partnership formed to serve as the companys majorityowned partnership subsidiary and to own through affiliates all of the companys real estate properties and other assets ue and uelp were created to own the majority of vornado realty trusts vornado vno  former shopping center business prior to the separation the portfolio is referred to as ue businesses unless the context otherwise requires references to we us and our refer to urban edge properties and uelp and their consolidated entitiessubsidiaries after giving effect to the transfer of assets and liabilities from vornado as

average rental rate of  per square foot on a gaap basis and  per square foot on a cash basis generating average rent spreads of  on a gaap basis and  on a cash basis investment strategies our investment strategy is to selectively deploy capital through a combination of acquisitions redevelopment and development in our target markets that is expected to generate attractive riskadjusted returns and at the same time to sell assets that no longer meet our investment criteria in addition to creating value from our existing assets through proactive management when appropriate we will redevelop certain assets will pursue new developments and will acquire properties adjacent to them during  we completed projects at walnut creek and east hanover rei identified approximately  million of development and redevelopment pipeline projects expected to be completed over the next several years completed the sale of a shopping center located in waterbury ct for  million resulting in a gain of  million the sale completed the reverse section  tax deferred exchange transaction with the acquisition of cross bay commons information provided on a sameproperty basis includes the results of properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and excludes properties that were under development redevelopment or that involve anchor repositioning where a substantial portion of the gross leasable area is taken out of service and properties acquired sold or in the foreclosure process during the periods being compared and totals  properties as of december   and december   acquired a  acre outparcel adjacent to tonnelle commons in north bergen nj for  million on december   which will be the future site of a  sf popeyes and executed contracts to acquire hudson mall in jersey city nj for an aggregate purchase price of  million the shops at bruckner in the bronx ny for an aggregate purchase price of  million and yonkers gateway center in yonkers ny for an aggregate purchase price of  million these acquisitions closed subsequent to december   capital strategies our capital strategy is to keep our balance sheet flexible and capable of supporting growth by using cash flow from operations borrowing under our existing line of credit and reinvesting funds from selective asset sales during  we transferred our property in englewood nj to receivership the receiver manages the property while the company remains the title owner until the receiver disposes of the property and ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of  million and net debt net of cash to total market capitalization of  as of december    outlook we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following expediting the delivery of space to and the collection of rent from tenants with executed leases that have not yet commenced creating additional value from our existing assets by redevelopment of existing space development of new space such as expansion and pad sites and by anchor repositioning and disposing of noncore assets and when possible reinvesting the proceeds in the redevelopment of andor new development on existing properties and in acquiring additional properties meeting our investment criteria critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses these estimates are prepared using managements best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition certain information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated and combined results of operations or financial condition our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in part ii item  of this annual report on form k however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows real estate  the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers means that we invest significant amounts of capital into our properties depreciation amortization and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole real estate is capitalized and depreciated on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets physical and economic useful lives which range from  to  years we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates these assessments have a direct impact on our net income real estate is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as they are incurred significant renovations and improvements that improve or extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized real estate undergoing redevelopment activities is also carried at cost but no depreciation is recognized all property operating expenses directly associated with and attributable to the redevelopment including interest are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when completed if the cost of the redeveloped property including the net book value of the existing property exceeds the estimated fair value of redeveloped property the excess is charged to impairment expense the capitalization period begins when redevelopment activities are underway and ends when the project is substantially complete generally a redevelopment is considered substantially completed and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income upon the acquisition of real estate we assess the fair value of acquired assets including land buildings and improvements identified intangibles such as acquired above and belowmarket leases acquired inplace leases and tenant relationships and acquired liabilities we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results known trends and marketeconomic conditions based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities in allocating the purchase price to identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property the value of abovemarket and belowmarket leases is estimated based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts including fixed rate belowmarket renewal options to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases and our estimate of the market lease rates and other lease provisions for comparable leases measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining term of the lease tenant related intangibles and improvements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related lease term including any bargain renewal options we amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of inplace leases if the value of belowmarket lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a lease terminates prior to its stated expiration all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off our properties are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable an impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis an impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the propertys carrying amount over its estimated fair value impairment analyses are based on our current plans intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared if our estimates of the projected future cash flows anticipated holding periods or market conditions change our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated and combined financial statements the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses allowance for doubtful accounts  we make estimates of the collectibility of our current accounts receivable and straightline rents receivable which require significant judgment by management the collectibility of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions bankruptcies and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense actual collectibility could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables we assess the collectibility of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable credit history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenants ability to meet its contractual lease obligations and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant the straightline receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements due to the nature of the straightline receivable the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the deferral of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured these estimates have a direct impact on our earnings revenue recognition  we have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rent  income arising from minimum lease payments from tenant leases these rents are recognized over the noncancelable term of the related leases on a straightline basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use in addition in circumstances where we provide a lease incentive to tenants we recognize the incentive as a reduction of rental revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the lease percentage rent  income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds these rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved expense reimbursements  revenue arising from tenant leases

and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared totaling  properties for the three months ended march   and  information provided on a sameproperty basis excludes properties that were under development redevelopment or that involve anchor repositioning where a substantial portion of the gross leasable area is taken out of service and also excludes properties acquired sold under contract to be sold or that are in the foreclosure process during the periods being compared while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations a property is removed from the sameproperty pool when a property is considered to be a redevelopment property because it is undergoing significant renovation or retenanting pursuant to a formal plan and is expected to have a significant impact on property operating income based on the retenanting that is occurring a development or redevelopment property is moved back to the sameproperty pool once a substantial portion of the noi growth expected from the development or redevelopment is reflected in both the current and comparable prior year period generally one year after at least  of the expected noi from the project is realized on a cash basis for a full quarter acquisitions are moved into the sameproperty pool once we have owned the property for the entirety of the comparable periods and the property is not under significant development or redevelopment we calculate sameproperty cash noi using net income as defined by gaap reflecting only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level adjusted for the following items lease termination fees bankruptcy settlement income noncash rental income and ground rent expense and income or expenses that we do not believe are representative of ongoing operating results if any the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to cash noi is net income cash noi excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a propertys results of operations we calculate cash noi by adjusting gaap operating income to add back depreciation and amortization expense general and administrative expenses real estate impairment losses and noncash ground rent expense and deduct noncash rental income resulting from the straightlining of rents and amortization of acquired below market leases net of above market leases we use cash noi internally to make investment and capital allocation decisions and to compare the unlevered performance of our properties to our peers further we believe cash noi is useful to investors as a performance measure because when compared across periods cash noi reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates rental rates operating costs and acquisition and disposition activity on an unleveraged basis providing perspective not immediately apparent from operating income or net income as such cash noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development redevelopment acquisition or disposition of properties during the periods presented and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the operating performance of the companys properties cash noi and sameproperty cash noi should not be considered substitutes for operating income or net income and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by others the following table reconciles net income to cash noi and sameproperty cash noi for the three months ended march   and  for the three months ended march  amounts in thousands   net income     add income tax expense   income before income taxes   interest income     interest and debt expense   loss on extinguishment of debt   operating income   depreciation and amortization
