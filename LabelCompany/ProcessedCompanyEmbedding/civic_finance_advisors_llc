parent receiving a lifechanging promotion getting ready to retire at times like these many people feel a need for financial help and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense thats when the search begins the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future someone wholl be there for you for years to come and who can provide more than just stock recommendations to find an advisor who can help you with those decisions dont be afraid to ask the following tough questions—theyll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you  what types of clients do you work with some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession others might have particular knowledge in a specialty such as sustainable investing or retirement planning ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future  what is your track record no advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance and beware those who do but an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty  how often will we talk an advisor should be committed to conversations in person by phone or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require every client has different needs and expectations be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances  how realistic are my goals even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money the right advisor can help you better understand and

should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift  what happens if the markets are volatile will you call me when markets get scary

your strategy  what if im upset about a service issue or an investment as life becomes increasingly automated theres nothing like a human voice and quick response when youre concerned about a financial matter advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues  who will i actually be working with many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide ask who youd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience beyond the immediate team does the company supporting them have access to a broad array

berkeley capital partners dan newberg cfp® partner chief compliance officer berkeley capital partners video transcript we manage all of the assets of our firm in house we have grown our business through family friends and their referrals and we treat everyone as such choosing to go independent was a conscious decision to get away from having mangers manage us the day we actually all agreed that this is the path we wanted to pursue the major pro was the client and you’re able to do what’s in the best interest of the client and there’s nothing that prevents you from doing your job schwab is agnostic as to how you manage assets they really leave it up to you to do what you think is best for your clients schwab provided a significant amount of resources and had an integral part of our successful transition transitioning a business is never easy it’s never without stress one of our own fears was us being responsible for our own compliance when we moved to schwab they had a team that came in they helped us identify those issues and it turned out to be very helpful communication with the clients relative to the move ended up being significantly easier than any of us expected they said “well do you really think it’s the right thing for me” and we could say unequivocally yes i have the ability to manage money any way that i see fit clients can sense our passion and our excitement about being able to do things we couldn’t do before the clients that were our clients that were entrepreneurs really started referring us more business than they normally had business owners respond to other business owners our firm’s experienced the best growth rate in our history i consider this more than just a business you know we consider it like a large extended family it’s more of a team feel and less of a competitive feel the ultimate goal is just serving the client and everybody will do fine you know if we do that there’s tons of freedom being independent um with the technology you have access to you can work from anywhere and still get great results so the fact that i can do my job wherever i need to be has allowed us to travel more spend more time i try to work from home  to  days maybe  days a month because i now run my own business i have that freedom now to do what i think is best for me and my family don’t focus so much on the fear of the move and the fear of the front end but focus on what you can do on the back end and longterm you know the trajectory will put you on for your customers and for yourself personally we don’t know how it’s gonna all shake out but we do think we’re in a better position to be agile being independent isn’t for everybody you have to have the right business mix but if you do i think with the way the industry’s

families manage your wealth find a financial advisor branch and private wealth advisor near you enter zipcode go invalid zipcode some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education  at the same time children are entering their ’s with student loan debt which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home even grandparents have modified life goals choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now rather than leaving a larger legacy later in short paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern but with a little advance planning families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college  the growing cost of education according to the college boards latest “trends in higher education report the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes financial aid and many consumer goods and services it now costs on average  per year for tuition fees room and board for a fouryear private college assuming a collegecost inflation rate of  today’s yearold child may need  come college time in  “for parents the numberone goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement but close behind is paying for a child’s education” says marc dextraze executive director morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions it takes a village to raise a child but in  it may take an extended family to educate one tweet this share this on linkedin share this on facebook email this one option says dextraze is for parents to start saving early with a  college savings plan  “having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans he says for the child “having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals as opposed to the college that offers the most aid and graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom named after section  of the internal revenue code a  plan is a taxadvantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save or even pay in advance for college expenses earnings in a  plan can be tax deferred and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition fees room and board and supplies many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that making education a family affair motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education grandparents relatives and even family friends have also begun creating  accounts in a child’s name not only do  plans offer potential tax advantages they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt “today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college says jennifer tierney vice president morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions and  plans product manager “its so important to plan ahead for grandparents aunts and uncles family friends it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that  plans provide to a child and from a taxperspective to themselves” related reading wealth management the real costs of not saving for college wealth management when little geniuses have big dreams wealth management how to break the ice around family finances a flexible way to save and invest for college the appeal of  plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility there are no income restrictions no required minimum distributions no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account and high contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at savingforcollegecom one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the  account as opposed to a utma uniform transfers to minors act or ugma uniform gifts to minors act account or other strategy “with s grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the end of the day the idea is to harmonize all of your goals taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there

tim o’reilly afterword whats next abhi nemani ← part  chapter  → chapter  from entrepreneurs to civic entrepreneurs introduction my brother mike and i never set out to become “civic entrepreneurs” we did not see ourselves as being a part of the “open government” community we were simply trying to solve a realworld problem and that problem required improving the interfaces to government data in this way i think our story is the story of many civic entrepreneurs in the fall of  we were young mike was  and i was  ambitious and looking for a way to make an impact we had just started an investment advisory company called alfred capital management we were managing money for individuals and families in san diego and working hard to build the company client by client a few months prior our father mike alfred sr had introduced us to one of his clients dan weeks who was an engineering manager at hewlettpackard hp he had hired our father for some legal advice related to his real estate properties dan presented a business plan to mike and me that attempted to solve a problem that he and his hp colleagues were struggling building sound investment portfolios within their hp k plans it was clear that dan was incredibly passionate about k investing mike and i liked his engineering background but we did not think the idea was viable at first through a series of brainstorming sessions over the following weeks and months—most involving a few whiskeys—the possibility of working with dan to improve retirement plans took on a new life these sessions turned out to be where brightscope began to take shape we felt we had what could be a big idea by individually rating every company retirement plan in the us we believed we would drive an overall improvement in the ability of americans to retire it was an ambitious goal the impact of which would reach far beyond our current client base—and that appealed to us defined contribution dc plans are a relatively new addition to the corporate retirement plan landscape rising out of the employee retirement income security act of  erisa as an elective retirement savings program for employees originally dc plans were thought of as supplemental to companysponsored defined benefit db pension plans but over time the dc plan firmly supplanted the db plan as the primary retirement savings vehicle for american workers as a result there has been a major shift in retirement responsibility from employer to employee in a db plan the company makes the contributions and the investment decisions but in a dc plan these two responsibilities fall squarely on the shoulders of employees unfortunately most employees lack the discipline to save enough for retirement and the skill to build a welldiversified portfolio as we researched these structural issues we uncovered other problems with dc plans we found voluminous literature on high retirement plan fees articles about conflicts of interest between plan service providers and plan participants and a general feeling that dc plans were not being operated in the best interest of participants at that point we knew the opportunity was not solely helping participants make smart decisions for themselves but also in defining what makes a dc plan good or bad so that we could inspire the companies who sponsor the plans to make them better our objective of helping millions more retire in dignity was really a big data problem and the first step was tracking down the right data the search for data quickly led us to the department of labor dol every retirement plan in the country files a form  annually with the dol think of the form  as a tax form listing the assets contributions fees and other details of each employee benefit plan larger plans those with more than a hundred participants are also required to obtain an annual audit the combination of form  and the audit reports represented a gold mine of information but first we would need access to the data which would require interfacing with the federal government the data we were looking for was not available through the dol website a few data companies were selling the  data but they did not have the additional highvalue data from the audit reports the decision was made to visit the dol’s public disclosure room to ask for the data in person at that point we did what any entrepreneur would do in our position wrote a business plan raised a little bit of money from friends and family and booked a flight to washington dc as it turned out this was the beginning of our path to civic entrepreneurship with brightscope though we never intended to build a business around “open data” and “open government” that was precisely what we were about to do when “public disclosure” is not enough showing up at the department of labor for the first time was definitely a culture shock we had been to dc several times before but mostly to visit the monuments as students we had never been to dc “on business” i do not think you can overstate the difference between startup culture and federal government culture startups are all about speed—fast decisions and rapid development in dc you get a sense that everything happens slowly and every decision is placed under the microscope the professional staff at the dol took their work very seriously but they were held back by a lagging technology infrastructure and years of working through a slow bureaucracy to get work done we made our way through dol security and the staff directed us toward the public disclosure room the public disclosure room itself is not much to speak of it is a small windowless room covered on two sides with bookcases filled with administrative staff manuals advisory opinion letters meeting minutes from advisory board meetings and a whole host of other items that might be of interest to the public a desk lined the left wall upon entering what appeared to be a sera ibm pc running a custom dol version of msdos sat on the desk it was difficult to use and looked to be gathering dust while this was the “public disclosure” room we personally could not imagine many members of the public visiting the room so the state of the computer did not surprise us by this point mike had realized that we would need to get some assistance from the dol staff in order for this trip to be successful so when an employee entered the room he engaged him in casual conversation before long both of us were standing behind the desk looking over the staffer’s shoulder as he dug through the dol database in search of the documents we described after thirty minutes of searching we found what looked like an audited financial statement for the first company we had been looking for after confirming that the document was in fact open to public inspection we printed a copy we repeated this process for ten to fifteen companies so that we could ensure that the data was consistently available we ended up leaving with audit reports from some of the companies with the largest retirement plans in the us including ibm and hp as well as some smaller companies that our friends worked at—google and facebook we were informed that the reports would cost fifteen cents a page which we agreed to and left the dol feeling buoyed by the fact that the data existed to accomplish our goals our initial excitement about the data was quickly replaced by frustration upon returning to san diego and working our way through the first fifteen plans we did a quick backoftheenvelope calculation that with sixty thousand audit reports an average of fifty pages per report and a cost of fifteen cents per page it would cost roughly  dollars to obtain the complete dataset for a single year to top it off the dol clearly had no way to provide the reports to us in bulk as evidenced by the manual way in which the dol staffer had printed the first fifteen reports for us there were also procedural hurdles while the dol instructed filers to avoid putting personally identifiable information pii such as social security numbers on the filings they would occasionally still find filings with this information and have to redact them while these redactions were rare they still caused the dol to create a policy of manually inspecting every printed page before providing the printed reports to the public with little to lose we put together a list of the sixty thousand plans for which we needed data and filed a formal foia request within a few weeks we found ourselves on a call with the dol foia staff we were told in no uncertain terms that our foia request was one of the most onerous requests they had ever received in hindsight given their limitations at the time this assessment seems fair however when data is the only thing standing in the way of building a business it is not what you want to hear we managed to work out a compromise with the dol in which they would print out hundreds of audit reports at a time put them into boxes and ship them to us it was not a sustainable system but using that approach we collected enough data to produce our ratings and launch our initial dc plan ratings to the public—and thus our company brightscope became a reality from adversaries to partners if forced to select a single term to define our relationship with the dol up through early  the word “adversarial” would certainly be appropriate we were asking for data that was nearly impossible for the dol to deliver without some fundamental procedural change investment in technology yet we would not accept no for an answer that status quo of shipping boxes was still in place at the time we launched our public website after initially choosing a launch date of january   we were wisely counseled to push back a week so we would not get lost in the news cycle of incoming president barack obama whose inauguration was set for january th the administration change seemed irrelevant to our business at the time but when president obama made his first order of business the release of his memorandum on transparency and open government it grabbed our attention the memorandum lacked formal teeth but it was music to our ears all agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in foia and to usher in a new era of open government obama  our business had quickly become heavily dependent on gaining access to public data but our progress was in fits and starts surging ahead when a new box of data arrived and then flagging when data was delayed or did not come at all almost overnight we felt a new tune coming out of washington a drumbeat of voices intent on making data open transparent and accessible and we felt this could only be good news while some felt that obama’s pledge did not cause any change the dol to their credit began to make steady progress in delivering on opening up their data what started as the manual printing and mailing of documents transformed into the shipping of external hard drives with thousands of audits this ultimately resulted in a bulk download utility that was accessible around the clock directly from the dol website we went from being constrained by data to having all of the data at our fingertips meanwhile our public ratings had begun to get serious traction we received numerous writeups in the wall street journal the new york times and other mainstream media and the traffic to our k ratings pages was on an upward arc starting with just eight hundred plans rated at launch we had reached fifteen thousand plans by october and thirty thousand plans by the end of december to process this volume of documents we brought on new engineers and hired and trained a team of data analysts our team quickly expanded from fewer than ten at launch to thirty by the end of the year our relationship with the dol has transformed over the years we have spent a tremendous amount of time with dol staffers and political appointees who have always taken time out of their busy schedules to meet with us when we are in town the relationship was facilitated by open government events which allowed for more casual interaction and discussion of big picture objectives in november of  our relationship with the dol truly came full circle impressed with the work we had done analyzing the audit reports the dol signed up as a brightscope client and began leveraging the data for a variety of purposes what started as a contentious relationship has turned into a true partnership thanks to the dol embracing an open approach to data finding comfort in transparency the changed relationship at the dol is thanks to a combination of a mindset shift on the part of the department and an adoption of technology to solve a business process challenge they became comfortable with more of their data being open to public inspection and they started viewing companies like brightscope as partners in their mandate of safeguarding retirement assets for participants in some respects the dol’s new approach reminds me of the original description of the power of open government described in the influential paper “government data and the invisible hand” robinson yu zeller  felten  in the paper the authors describe the limited role of government as requiring and enforcing appropriate disclosure but stopping short of building interactive websites this is instead focusing on opening up the data to the public so that the private market can engage with the data and ultimately drive its usage and interaction with the public in order for public data to benefit from the same innovation and dynamism that characterize private parties’ use of the internet the federal government must reimagine its role as an information provider rather than struggling as it currently does to design sites that meet each enduser need it should focus on creating a simple reliable and publicly accessible infrastructure that “exposes” the underlying data robinson yu zeller  felten  this way of thinking about government is not new but it is a fundamental shift from how we traditionally think about government asking government to stay focused on data collection and distribution and leaving the building of websites and valueadded tools on top of the data to the private sector might seem like chaos to some but this approach has worked wonders even within the private sector open government thinker tim o’reilly  describes this phenomenon as “government as a platform” brightscope’s plan ratings can be thought of as an “app” on a government platform leveraging data from the dol and sec undoubtedly firms like brightscope and others will be able to build faster take more risks and combine the dol’s data with thirdparty data in more new interesting and costeffective ways than the dol could themselves so it makes sense for the dol to focus on platformizing itself and taking advantage of the entrepreneurial energy and innovations of the private market defining open data while brightscope started with dol data as we have grown we have gathered data and information from a variety of public sources including the securities and exchange commission sec the census bureau and the financial industry regulatory authority finra through the process of identifying highvalue datasets and integrating them into our databases we have encountered all different types of public disclosure at brightscope we are fond of saying that “public” is not a proxy for accessible usable or highvalue it is useful therefore to describe the best practices of how government agencies and departments currently disclose data and some of the issues their methodologies create in addition through this analysis it is useful to have a common framework with which to evaluate the quality of the disclosure both in terms of data openness and legal openness technical openness when it comes to technical openness our first belief is that releasing data in whatever state it is in is better than releasing no data at all startups have become remarkably adept at working with data and can usually develop processes to transform disclosed data into whatever form and format they need it in that said the lower the barrier to adoption the more engagement you can generate around the data you are releasing the following framework comes from cass sunstein president obama’s regulatory czar and the author of nudge improving decisions about health wealth and happiness and simpler the future of government in a memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies on september   he describes a simple fourpart test he uses to define “smart disclosure” accessible free online and in bulk machinereadable standardized timely sunstein  when we first started working with the dol the disclosure failed all four tests the data was not accessible online it was not available in machinereadable formats it was not standardized and it was certainly not timely due to a nearly twoyear delay for processing however the new dol disclosure satisfies two of the four requirements it is available online both file by file and in bulk for developers and it is timely being published within twentyfour to fortyeight hours of the disclosure being filed the reports are not machinereadable unfortunately nor are they standardized largely due to the fact that the reports are narrative attachments to a document the form  so they still require processing i would still give the dol high marks for making the most of what they currently receive though legal openness even once data is technically accessible it must be open from a legal standpoint for it to be truly “open” the “open definition” as defined by the open knowledge foundation is perhaps the standard in defining legal “openness” as it relates to data and content their definition is simple a piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use reuse and redistribute it—subject only at most to the requirement to attribute andor sharealike open knowledge foundation opening up data in this way so that there are no limitations on use reuse and redistribution can be tough to stomach for those with data some organizations with important consumer disclosures that they place on the web put strict legal limitations with how the information can be used one example of this is the financial industry regulatory authority finra finra operates brokercheck a website that provides tools for consumers to research brokers and brokerdealers the brokercheck website has a prominently placed legal notice making clear its “closed” legal stance the works of authorship contained in finraorg the site  may not be copied reproduced transmitted displayed performed distributed rented sublicensed uploaded posted framed altered stored for subsequent use or otherwise used in whole or in part in any manner without finra’s prior written consent finra this legal language is against the spirit of open government while the data is online and technically disclosed it is not legally open and that distinction is important it is certainly understandable for an organization like finra to have concerns about how their data will be used ensuring that data is correctly communicated to and interpreted by the public is an important goal but if that was the only blocking issue i think it could be overcome i fear that organizations like finra do not open their data because they are concerned with the potential negative impact as described by gavin newsom in his book citizenville information often ends up being used against them historically people who request data or information aren’t doing it because they want to solve a problem or create a program they’re often doing it for political purposes as a kind of “gotcha government newsom  we in the open data community need to do a better job communicating why the benefits of releasing open data outweigh the potential negative effects if we fail to make the case some of the highest value datasets will either be legally closed or hidden from public view entirely which would dramatically limit the potential of the open data movement fortunately i think many government agencies and departments have been able to clear this hurdle the dol undoubtedly had internal questions and concerns about the results of disclosing in a legally open fashion but even with a small dose of engagement from the developer community that disclosure has yielded huge benefits organizations that publish data under a closed license lose the opportunity to cut their costs and leverage the combined skills and abilities of websavvy engineers and entrepreneurs all over the world lowering the barriers to the next generations of civic startups at brightscope we spend a tremendous amount of time collecting processing and integrating the data we obtain from our government partners we recognize like most data companies that data requires stewardship to ensure that the data quality is suitable for research analysis and public consumption the challenge for a civic entrepreneur accessing data from the government is that today too much of their work lies in the behindthescenes discovery cleansing and matching across datasets and not enough in building the end tools for their users by promoting data standards we can ensure that the work we are doing as civic entrepreneurs and the money invested in our mission is funneled into the highervalue work of creating real tools for consumer decisions one example of this for brightscope comes from the dol filings in order to calculate all of the fees consumers are paying within their k plans we need to include the harddollar fees found directly in the form  as well as the fees coming from the plan’s investment options this combination of administrative and investment fees becomes what we call “total plan cost” fortunately the investment lineup is contained in the audited financial statement while the audited financial statement provides a list of investment options it only requires the name of the investment and not an identification number for it this makes it impossible to directly link the fund to data on mutual funds that is collected and disclosed by the sec as a result brightscope spends hundreds of thousands of dollars every year parsing out the fund names from the audited financial statement matching the names to the correct sec fund id and pulling in sec fund fee data so we can effectively calculate each plan’s total plan cost each additional data transformation we make opens the door to introducing errors into our database if the dol were to simply require plans to file a standardized schedule of assets with the sec fund id then brightscope could take the hundreds of thousands of dollars we invest in our current process and invest it higher up the value chain instead across the federal government there are literally thousands of examples where a lack of coordination across agencies and departments leads to lost opportunities to make mashups of government data tremendously easier for entrepreneurs a more prominent example of this phenomenon is all the data released every year across state and federal governments about individual companies information about their earnings is available from the sec information about their retirement plans are available from the dol information about their lobbying activity is available from the senate office of public records information about their environmental record is available from the environmental protection agency and information about federal contracts they have won is available from the general services administration yet there is no easy way to link all of these datasets together this is actually a broader issue that came to light during the financial crises in which the debt of failing institutions was hard to track down and thus it was difficult for companies to gauge their “counterparty risk” this difficulty—and the rapidly declining risk tolerance of the firms in question due to liquidity concerns—caused a freeze in the otc derivatives and ultimately the credit markets in which banks and others refused to lend because of concern about their existing exposures this issue has led to calls from industry for an international legal entity identifier lei system in the financial markets it is designed to handle the hierarchy problem—for example it is estimated that aig has over  operating subsidiaries and operations in  countries the benefits of lei are important the legal entity identifier lei program is designed to create and apply a single universal standard identifier to any organization or firm involved in a financial transaction internationally such an identifier for each legal entity would allow regulators to conduct more accurate analysis of global systemically important financial institutions and their transactions with all counterparties across markets products and regions allowing regulators to better identify concentrations and emerging risks for risk managers in financial institutions the lei will increase the effectiveness of tools aggregating their exposures to counterparties the depository trust  clearing corporation  while lei is designed to solve a problem in the financial markets it may also serve the open government community provided it is either adopted throughout the government or utilities are built that provide mapping from the codes of each individual branch of government to the lei this is also not the only approach open government advocates like beth noveck a founder of orgpedia and the sunlight foundation have taken the lead on advocating for a better approach but there is still much work to be done creating open source standards for identification and linking across datasets is not easy but with every breakthrough we lower the barriers to adoption of data for analysis and research the benefits accrue to open data entrepreneurs and also to the very government agencies and departments tasked with regulating the companies products and industries that presently lack standards closing thoughts while we did not think of ourselves as civic entrepreneurs when we started our history is really a history of government as a platform and building a business on public data when we first met and spoke with open government evangelists like tim o’reilly jen pahlka alex howard beth noveck laurel ruma and countless others we began to realize how powerful an idea it truly was to provide entrepreneurs with data and access to government brightscope is proof that building a viable forprofit business on top of government data can be a sustainable business model that both benefits government and provides enormous opportunities for entrepreneurs now it is up to the open data community to work to lower the barriers to entry for future civic entrepreneurs about the authors ryan alfred is cofounder president and coo of brightscope a financial information company that brings transparency

most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future someone wholl be there for you for years to come and who can provide more than just stock recommendations to find an advisor who can help you with those decisions dont be afraid to ask the following tough questions—theyll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you  what types of clients do you work with some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession others might have particular knowledge in a specialty such as sustainable investing or retirement planning ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future  what is your track record no advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance and beware those who do but an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty  how often will we talk an advisor should be committed to conversations in person by phone or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require every client has different needs and expectations be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances  how realistic are my goals even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with

concerns offer perspective and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy  what if im upset about a service issue or an investment as life becomes increasingly automated theres nothing like a human voice and quick response when youre concerned about a financial matter advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues  who will i actually be working with many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide ask who youd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience beyond the immediate team does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources  how do i pay you for your work its never easy to ask but the right advisors will welcome this question
