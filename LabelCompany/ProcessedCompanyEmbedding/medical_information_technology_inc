link email print “my entire world sort of clicked off i didnt hear anything i didnt see anything and the only thing that i could think of was im going to be dead in six months” this is james looking back at  the year the dow closed above  the hubble space telescope was turned on and james was diagnosed with hiv “im a survivor of domestic violence child molestation depression” he says with some pride even so james knew he was about to enter the toughest fight of his life  after all while hivaids awareness was still relatively new in  james was seeing growing evidence of something much bigger “first there would be the fever and then there was the immense weight loss along with the kaposi’s sarcoma lesions that would appear on the body” james says “a person would die and sometimes it would happen over a week”  james also explained that since doctors had just begun researching hiv there were almost no treatment options available “the medication at the time was fairly nonexistent” he recalls of the side effects he says “the medication that they had at the time was even worse than the disease itself”  thanks to years of investment and hard work by america’s biopharmaceutical companies and other health care stakeholders things have changed dramatically – and patients likes james who can look back  years in neardisbelief are proof  brian a researcher developing hivaids medications for nearly  years is astounded by how far treatment has come “the progress is actually quite miraculous” he says “in the early days the goal was just keeping patients alive as long as possible  resistance was rampant and the regimens were not tolerable for many patients but the alternative was death  frankly both options were horrible  fast forward  years and now we have several onepill onceaday treatment options for patients and their physicians to choose from”   “they can live a normal life – a healthy successful life”  today the outlook has never been more promising with more than  medicines and vaccines in development to treat prevent or help with the disease impact of hivaids  as brian explains treatment is no longer simply about survival but enabling individuals to regain the quality of life they once had “it is extremely motivating when we hear that a physician has a patient who is benefiting that the new medicines weve brought forward have allowed the patient to regain weight reverse the progression of their disease and essentially have a new life ahead of them” james understands the sentiment personally – and recognizes the network that helped him back “my family my doctors who were trying to make sure that i got the right medications to keep me going” he says “the programs that helped me find housing sent me back to school and helped me to better myself”   “i have a great doctor most of doctors that ive had have been very good and this last one has been just fantastic  we have gotten me to a point now where my numbers are just fantastic”  james’s experience motivated him to help others he began volunteering at san francisco city hall by taking calls helping around the office and any job in between this volunteer work led to hiv community activism – and a run for office while he may not have won his election james continued to give back to others providing the same kind of support he is so thankful to have received  james recently lost his partner to aids and his brother to cancer still he knew he had to keep moving forward  “the thing that gives me hope is just being able to wake up every day” he says “i will get back up”  brian knows there’s still a long way to go “there are people who are alive today because of the work that we do” he acknowledges “the work is often very quiet very slow moving very frustrating but over time it has a major impact on thousands of people” and brian sees even greater hope ahead “i dont take no for an answer” he says “the power of imagination and innovation is incredible and i see it every day in the eyes of my colleagues”  “science is real and the key to solving problems we just need to find the right people to bring together collaborate and find a solution”   james is grateful for brian’s – and many other researchers’ – tenacity “im not sure how to explain it any better” he says “than it just makes me feel a little more normal” related news living with hiv eric’s

perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic
