graphite project june   valterra resource corporation tsxv vqa the “company” or “valterra” reported today that new sampling from the bobcaygeon graphite property located in southern ontario continues to expand and develop targeting at two prospects on the project sampling and mapping at the salerno zone returned values of up to  cg over  metres in graphiterich horizons within gneissic marbles near the contact with gneissic clastic metasedimentary rocks the new assay results confirm both earlier sampling in the area and extend mineralization to the north and northeast the graphiterich horizon lies along the north contact of the salerno creek deformation zone and is believed to extend some  meters to the west and is up to  to  meters wide further sampling on the salerno creek zone suggests that there is potential for several other parallel zones located to the north of the current sampling assays from these samples are pending  table select assays from surface sampling on the bobcaygeon project the salerno creek zone is one of two areas identified by the company that have been targeted for drill testing in  pending financing as part of the continued exploration of the bobcaygeon project mapping at the crystal zone has identified visible graphite throughout a  meter wide corridor within a gneissic clastic metasediment and a gneissic marble where the contacts are bounded by major fault zones surface chip sampling has identified wide intervals of  cg throughout the zone including  cg over  metres and  cg over  metres with additional anomalous graphite values identified in sampling approximately  metres to the south and several hundred metres to the northeast of the current sampling visually the zone appears to continue on all sides trenching and further surface reconnaissance is warranted to upgrade this zone for drill targeting the crystal zone is located between the discovery zone to the southwest and the salerno zone to the northeast and provides geological continuity along the  kilometre strikelength of the graphitic stratigraphy located on the bobcaygeon property figure known graphite occurrences on the bobcaygeon graphite property about the bobcaygeon project the bobcaygeon graphite property is favorably situated in precambrian calcitic marble of the grenville province with four past producing flakegraphite mines located to the northeast of the property and within the same geological belt at least six flake graphitebearing zones ranging from  metre to  metres thick have been located on surface and numerous other targets are indicated over a  kilometre strikelength all of which require further definition before the full potential of the project can be determined highgrade graphite horizons  cg occur on the property at the discovery and salerno zones trenching at the discovery zone has uncovered a highgrade vein which returned graphite values of  cg over m  cg over m and  cg over m sampling and mapping has identified a drillready target of over  metres that is supported by recent em and ipres geophysics on the property scout drilling at the discovery zone trench has identified highgrade graphite averaging  cg over  metres about  metres down dip from the surface sampling historic drilling in the ’s at the salerno zone for zinc identified graphitebearing stratigraphy over a km strike length mapping in the area has identified multiple graphite horizons and sampling has confirmed the highgrade potential of this newly developed occurrence current planning would test through drilling a  kilometre cumulative strikelength of the target area further regional work including mapping prospecting and trenching is planned to delineate the full extent of the graphitic stratigraphy throughout the property about

of closing and us on fourth anniversary of closing the property is subject to royalties totaling  of net smelter returns which valterra may reduce to  for us million advance minimum royalty payments will be due upon the anniversary of the option exercise as follows us on first second and third anniversaries and us on subsequent anniversaries historical production at weepah occurred from shallow underground mines and a small open pit during two separate time intervals from  to  weepah nevada mining co produced gold from  metric tonnes grading gt from  to  sunshine mining co produced at various grades approximately  oz of additional gold with accessory silver historic production figures are from several published and unpublished company reports however a qualified person has not done sufficient work to verify these grades and tonnages and valterra cautions that these historic production figures should not be relied upon the gold mineralization at weepah occurs within two broad shear zones the western shear zone was exploited by the small open pit and adjacent underground workings the eastern shear zone was exploited by historic workings and was extended by recent drilling the zones have been traced for several hundred meters along strike and variably down dip portions of the shear zones are exposed at surface or in workings and portions have been traced by widely spaced drill holes beneath shallow gravel cover which is generally less than m to m thick vein textures and geochemistry suggest the mineralization is similar to many other mesothermal vein deposits along the western margin of north america work conducted by valterra earlier this year included data compilation d modeling and identification of drill targets confirmation sampling by valterra in the open pit yielded results similar to those reported by others highlighted valterra sampling includes south pit face  chipchannel samples of up to m of  gt au and m of  gt au in two adjacent samples
