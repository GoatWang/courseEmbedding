about the fund please read the prospectus carefully before you invest there are risks associated with investing including possible loss of principal fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk their value will normally decline as interest rates rise the fund seeks to mitigate interest rate risk by taking short positions in us treasuries but there is no guarantee this will be achieved derivative investments can be volatile and these investments may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuers ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline the funds may engage in “short sale” transactions of us treasuries where losses may be exaggerated potentially losing more money than the actual cost of the investment and the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms causing a loss to the funds while the funds attempt to limit credit and counterparty exposure the value of an investment in the funds may change quickly and without warning in response to issuer or counterparty defaults and changes in the credit ratings of the funds’ portfolio investments investing in mortgage and assetbacked securities involves interest rate credit valuation extension and liquidity risks and the risk that payments on the underlying assets are delayed prepaid subordinated or defaulted on securities with floating rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes than securities with fixed interest rates but may decline in value the issuance of floating rate notes by the us treasury is new and the amount of supply will be limited fixed income securities will normally decline in value as interest rates rise the value of an investment in the fund may change quickly and
