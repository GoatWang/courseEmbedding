prepared detailoriented thoughtful inquisitive and willing to change her mind if presented with a compelling argument continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story i also saw the secretary’s commitment to our nation’s security her belief that america is an exceptional nation that must lead in the world for the country to remain secure and prosperous her understanding that diplomacy can be effective only if the country is perceived as willing and able to use force if necessary and most important her capacity to make the most difficult decision of all — whether to put young american women and men in harm’s waymrs clinton was an early advocate of the raid that brought bin laden to justice in opposition to some of her most important colleagues on the national security council during the early debates about how we should respond to the syrian civil war she was a strong proponent of a more aggressive approach one that might have prevented the islamic state from gaining a foothold in syriai never saw her bring politics into the situation room in fact i saw the opposite when some wanted to delay the bin laden raid by one day because the white house correspondents dinner might be disrupted she said “screw the white house correspondents dinner”in sharp contrast to mrs clinton mr trump has no experience on national security even more important the character traits he has exhibited during the primary season suggest he would be a poor even dangerous commander in chiefthese traits include his obvious need for selfaggrandizement his overreaction to perceived slights his tendency to make decisions based on intuition his refusal to change his views based on new information his routine carelessness with the facts his unwillingness to listen to others and his lack of respect for the rule of lawthe dangers that flow from mr trump’s character are not just risks that would emerge if he became president it is already damaging our

win strategy morell is the dangerous one as well as obama and hillary and their buddies in the muslimbrotherhood who are advising their foreign policy by arming sunni fundamentalist rebels in libya and syria against assad and quaddaffi who both were fighting terrorism to begin with  obama and hillary supported the muslimbrotherhood candidates in both elections in egypt and turkey  the us foreign policy has much innocent blood on our hands by siding with and arming sunnirebels all over the middle east and allowing the gitmo military leaders to go free and who are running isis right now as they

good question facebook twitter google  email comment print michael morell explained that clinton is highly qualified for the job and will deliver on the most important duty of a president — keeping our nation safe  ap photo former cia chief putin recruited trump as an unwitting agent of russia share on facebook share on twitter for former acting cia director michael morell donald trump does not have what it takes to be commander in chief in a new york times oped published friday the year agency veteran notes that he has been heretofore private with his political preferences and is registered as neither a democrat nor a republicanstory continued below no longer on nov  i will vote for hillary clinton between now and then i will do everything i can to ensure that she is elected as our th president wrote morell morell also suggested that russian president vladimir putin has successfully coopted trumps message in complimenting the political neophyte and getting exactly what he wanted in return with more praise even in light of his strongman tendencies toward journalists and dissidents in the intelligence business we would say that mr putin had recruited mr trump as an unwitting agent of the russian federation morell wrote morell laid out two strongly held beliefs that led him to the conclusion that clinton should be president the first of those morell explained is that clinton is highly qualified for the job and will deliver on the most important duty of a president — keeping our nation safe second donald j trump is not only unqualified for the job but he may well pose a threat to our national security he continued noting his work with clinton in her capacity of secretary of state and her resolute advocacy of the raid that led to the killing of osama bin laden in  trump has no experience on national security morell wrote even more important the character traits he has exhibited during the primary season suggest he would be a poor even dangerous commander in chief morell said naming trumps obvious need for selfaggrandizement his overreaction to perceived slights his tendency to make decisions based on intuition his refusal to change his views based on new information his routine carelessness with the facts his unwillingness to listen to others and his lack of respect for the rule of law the dangers that flow from mr trump’s character are not just risks that would emerge if he became president it is already damaging our national security trumps evolving proposal to ban muslim immigrants from the us has also undermined national security playing into the hands of the jihadist narrative that our fight against terrorism is a war between religions he continued my training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as i see it this is what i did for the cia this is what i am doing now morell concluded our nation will be much safer with hillary clinton as president the forceful words from the former top official represent only the latest denouncement of trump from within the intelligence community former cia director michael hayden for example has expressed strong reservations about trump leading the nations armed forces clintons campaign featured hayden and other conservative voices criticizing trumps temperament and preparedness in a new second ad out friday titled unfit trump responded to the latest attack on his foreign policy chops with a statement directly blaming both clinton and president barack obama for destabilizing the middle east having let isis take firm hold in iraq libya and syria not to mention their allowing americans to be slaughtered at benghazi clinton’s home email server that she lied to the american people about was a profound national security risk and it should come as no surprise that her campaign would push out another obamaclinton pawn who is not independent to try to change the subject in a week when clinton’s role in putting iran on the path to nuclear weapons and this administration being called out for sending  million in cash to the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism is on every front page in the country trump said in a statement in reference to the amount of money paid in cash to iran earlier this year on the same day four american prisoners were freed hillary clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as president he added a slew of republicans have either said they will not support trump or outright defected to supporting clinton including hewlettpackard ceo meg whitman new york rep richard hanna former national security adviser brent scowcroft former deputy secretary of state richard armitage and former treasury secretary hank paulson frank lavin who served as director of the office of political affairs under ronald reagan and ambassador to singapore under george w bush also endorsed clinton in a statement provided to politico “having served under presidents ronald reagan and george w bush i’ve seen what it takes to be commanderinchief and to make split second decisions under extreme pressure – donald trump doesn’t have that lavin said calling trump “temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states and just the thought of him having access to nuclear codes is unnerving i simply can’t support someone as erratic as donald trump lavin continued “thats why for the first time in my life i am voting for a democrat for president i’m voting for hillary clinton because she has what it takes to keep our country safe from threats here at home and abroad share on facebook share on twitter this story tagged

hillary clintons ability to handle classified infohe said putin played to trumps ego to manipulate the gop nomineewashington cnnformer cia actingdirector michael morell said sunday hed trust hillary clinton with the nations security but that donald trump is being manipulated by russian president vladimir putin morell who cast trump as an unwitting agent of putin in a new york times oped last week said on abcs this week that hes comfortable with clinton after seeing her in action in president barack obamas administration i worked with her for four years very closely when she was secretary of state and i was at the cia i provided her  personally provided her some of the most sensitive information that the central intelligence agency has he said she never misused it she always protected it he added i would trust her with the crown jewels of the united states government and more importantly i would trust her with the future security of the country and the future security of my kidshis endorsement could help clinton amid renewed criticism over her use of a private email server read moremorell also said he believes putin  a trained intelligence officer worked for the kgb very talented manipulated people much smarter than donald trump  has intentionally been using trumps ego as a way in with the republican nominee he played this perfectly right he saw that donald trump wanted to be complimented morell said he complimented him that led donald trump to then compliment vladimir putin and to defend vladimir putins actions in a number of places around the worldand donald trump didnt even understand right that putin was playing him so in putins mind i have no doubt that putin thinks that hes an unwitting agent of the russian federation although putin would never say that he said from mr trumps perspective right he simply heard putin compliment him he then responded by complimenting him he never thought that he might be being playedtrump pushed back against morell

httprdffreebasecomnsmeasurementunitdatedpercentage  if youre writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
