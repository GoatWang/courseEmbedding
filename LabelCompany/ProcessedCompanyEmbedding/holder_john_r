 field of the inventionthe present invention relates generally to a device and method for the packaging and distribution of products and more particularly to a method and device which permits the products to be packaged and displayed along the binding of a publication or an object of similar size andor design with at least one planar surface to which the device may be attached corporations devote considerable time and resources in advertising and promoting their products and more particularly in giving away sample trial portions of their products for consumers to examine it is however difficult to place those products into the hands of the desired target audience while direct mail advertising has proven to be an effective means of product promotion the very nature of the medium makes it difficult to place product samples into the hands of the target consumers although product samples may be sent to the general public through the mail along with literature describing the product this method does not always place the product with the mostdesired class of consumers further the advertising material and product sampler often arrive at different times which dilutes the impact of the advertising particularly when the advertising literature is disposed of summarily incorporating a product sample in a magazine is also a common practice by directing their sample products to select magazine subscribers advertisers may effectively reach a desired group of potential customers an advertisement is usually placed within the magazine in question accompanied by the occasional flat sample of a product such as for example a fragrance however due to the limitations of the design of a magazine it is impractical to include any kind of sample having significant threedimensional shape such as a small shampoo bottle as it would prevent the subject magazine from closing the present invention is designed to provide a means for distributing sample materials and promotional items efficiently and selectively therefore providing a more efficient utilization of limited corporate resources the present invention discloses a product sample holder which is lightweight inexpensive and efficient and is designed to be utilized in conjunction with magazines or publications with a square glued binding the design of the present invention permits easy insertion of product samples and secure closure of the holder by means of a closure plug and adhesive seal and is easily attached to the square binding of a magazine or publication by means of flexible clear adhesive tape once attached it is a unique feature of the holder of the present invention and a significant improvement over the prior art in that it will not interfere with the mailing or newsstand distribution of the attached magazine thereby ensuring that the targeted consumers will receive their publication with all of the samples intact further the clear plastic tubing of the preferred embodiment of the subject holder allows for easy identification of the samples enclosed therewith it is also a feature of the present invention that the use of a flexible clear adhesive tape as a fastening means does not affect the front and rear covers of the magazine thereby preserving the integrity of costly advertising space as well as the aesthetic appeal of the subject publication as will be seen the unique design of the holder of the present invention also permits the magazine subscriber or newsstand purchaser to easily detach the subject holder and remove the product samples thus it provides an effective means for distributing sample products to a select class of consumers without the limitations inherent in other methods and devices for sample distribution  description of the prior art several patents directed to the promotion of advertising goods or to the incorporation of goods within a publication are known in the prior art for example us pat no  to walker discloses a pencil holder adapted to engage the grooves of the binding of a book however walker requires the use of a semicircular tube open on one side as opposed to a tube which is totally enclosed with a hinged latch at one end walkers device relies on friction to maintain contact with the binding of a book and would therefore not be appropriate for attachment to the binding of a magazine or other object with a planar surface further a book incorporating walker would be damaged in the event that a liquid sample were to burst inside this holder additionally books incorporating walkers device would not be stackable us pat no  to schluger discloses a paperboard sample container for use in direct mail advertising there are many disadvantages with such a device however that are not found in the present invention for example schluger effectively doubles the thickness of a publication by in effect covering the whole back of the publication with the sample container which would lead to significantly increased production and shipping costs as the shipper could only stack half as many publications in the same amount of space for distribution further covering up the back of a publication necessarily obscures the rear cover advertising which is one of the most desirable advertising spots in any publication clearly any advertiser that would pay a premium to be on the back cover would not want its expensive advertisement to be obscured nor would the publications owners necessarily be willing to forsake this valuable advertising space in addition because of its obvious bulk and limited flexibility the schluger device when combined with a standard  by  publication may not be flexible enough to fit into most mailboxes the use of schluger would also prevent one from reading the subject publication at a newsstand without tearing it apart further since the samples are on the back page they cannot be seen from the front which is the way a magazine is typically displayed us pat no  also to schluger is a product sample mailer and is not designed to be attached to a publication us pat no  to cooper discloses and claims a removable sample pouch bound into the spine of a magazine this requires a special procedure during production of the subject publication to attach a page in the center of the magazine and stitch it to the publications spine this is unlike the holder of the present invention in which the holder is attached after publication thereby preventing the entire publication process from having to be redesigned further the use of the pouches disclosed in cooper would not protect the samples from being crushed or damaged by the weight of a stack of magazines and would alter the appearance of the publication by creating a bulge in its middle this is in contrast to the holder of the instant invention which is designed to ride along the binding cooper requires the use of costly velcro or ziplock closure devices and places the samples inside the magazine in a less visible spot us pat no  to bullard jr discloses an advertising booklet which is adapted to hold a sample of the goods being advertised through a plurality of slots extending partially through the pages this is impractical for use in a magazine as it would require cutting holes in the publication thereby rendering articles unreadable alternatively it could force a redesign of the entire format of the subject publication also because each sample display area requires a custommade cutout there will be additional costs incurred for each customer for example the samples may fall out at a newsstand when a reader opens the magazine to preview articles additionally liquid samples may rupture thereby destroying the magazine further because the sample cutout goes through most of the subject magazine various other advertisers will find their expensive advertisement sitting next to another companys sample product finally once the samples are removed from bullard the subject publication will still contain holes and will never look like a magazine again us pat no  to oglesbee discloses a simple molded plastic holder for pediatric product samples oglesbee is however a standalone product container and is not intended to be utilized with a publication as is the holder of the instant invention us pat no  to porter et al discloses an apparatus for distributing product samples to consumers along with a publication though means of a shrinkwrap covering whereby the products are displayed through recess windows cut out in the display container porter however increases the thickness of a magazine and prevents viewing of the magazine at a newsstand because of the shrinkwrap encapsulation around the magazine porter also covers up the back of the magazine thereby obscuring the advertisement on the back cover of the magazine porter also substantially increases the total weight of a publication and correspondingly its mailing costs further should the shrinkwrap container rip the samples would be lost and the publication would take on a ragged appearance finally as the sample container must be designed and manufactured to be unique to the size of the particular samples the additional inherent costs associated therewith may be prohibitive a review of the prior art disclosed above indicates that while there have been numerous attempts to devise a means for distributing product samples along with a publication there remain inherent problems with each one as described the use of some of the above devices will result in an increased cost incurred due to the required customization of the sample holder others cause the valuable backpage advertisements to be obscured or otherwise lost others will result in a significant increase in shipping costs by providing unnecessary bulk and weight to the publication these devices therefore lack the desired benefit of providing an inexpensive efficient and standardized means for placing product samples in the hands of magazine subscribers or readers while not adversely affecting the appearance andor size of the subject publications  summary of the invention against the foregoing background it is a primary objective of the present invention to provide a holder which may be used for distributing sample products and promotional materials it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that may be attached to the binding of a magazine or publication or any other object with at least one planar surface it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder adapted for use in distributing sample materials to a selected sample of the public therefore providing an efficient utilization of corporate resources it is another

allows for maximum product visibility it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that does not have to be customdesigned in order to hold many different varieties of product samples it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that does not have to be customdesigned and manufactured for each target publication it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that appears to be a natural extension of the attached publication it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that may be distributed by a publisheradvertiser with products consistent with the theme of the subject publication it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that fits flush against the binding of the publication thereby allowing the publications to be easily stacked without damaging the holder or the publication it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that does not obscure or alter the front cover of the publication thereby preserving the aesthetic newsstand appeal of the publication it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder which does not obscure or alter the back cover of the publication thereby preserving same as a prime source of advertising revenue it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that when attached to a publication will not alter the flexibility of the publication to permit it to fit into the mailboxes of subscribers it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that permits potential purchasers of the attached publication to review the subject publication at a newsstand it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that may be of a clear plastic which allows for easy and quick identification of the particular products enclosed thereby providing both increased impact on potential consumers as well as additional incentive for prospective newsstand customers to purchase the publication it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that may be segmented so as to provide safe encapsulation for a plurality of product samples it is another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that is easily attached to the subject publication by nonpermanent adhesive means so that it will not interfere with the production of the subject publication it is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that may be easily and fully detached from the subject publication without harming its binding the cover art or the back cover advertising it is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that is designed to be discarded after use it is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a holder of product samples and promotional materials that act as incentives to purchase the subject publication over other publications on display therefore increasing the sales of the publication it is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a holder that consists of a fully enclosed tube thereby ensuring excellent protection of the product samples as well as an effective means of protecting the products from tampering to the accomplishments of the foregoing objects and advantages and to address the above concerns in a manner distinguishable from the prior art the present invention in brief summary comprises a housing of plastic plastic product holding containers or other methods of packaging sample products or promotional materials and a clear adhesive tape fastening means to bind same to a square perfect gluedtype binding of a publication the holder is designed for a custom fit to the binding of the publication thereby providing a sample product holder which will appear as if it belonged as a part of the magazine in question and will be adaptable to be mailed to magazine subscribers or easily displayed for purchase at a newsstand  brief description of the drawings the above and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the accompanying drawings in which fig  is a front perspective view of an embodiment of the holder of the present invention as attached to a magazine fig  is a perspective view of the holder of fig  independent of the magazine fig  is a perspective view of the tube end closure of the holder fig  is a perspective view of the sampleproduct container as depicted in figs  and  and fig a is a perspective view of an alternate embodiment of the sampleproduct container of the holder fig b is a perspective view of another alternate embodiment of the sampleproduct container of the holder  detailed description of the invention referring to the figures and in particular figs  and  the binding product holder of the present invention referred to generally by reference numeral  comprises a housing  which includes a tube  an end closure plug  at least one individual product container  a permanent plastic welded end closure  and a fastening means  utilized to fasten the housing  to a publication such as for example magazine  tube  is generally in a long rectangular shape in a preferred embodiment the corners of the tube  may be slightly rounded but the surfaces sufficiently planar so as to permit the interior edge  of the tube  to mount flush with the square binding of the magazine  and to permit the exterior edge  of the tube  to be coded with information such as the name of the publication monthissue and publishing code information the latter may be accomplished through direct printing or by placing an adhesive label thereon tube  is made from a thin clear cellulose propionate plastic material about  to  inches thick and as such is both inexpensive to obtain and manufacture and may be easily disposed of the length of tube  should not be longer than the length of the magazine binding to which it is adopted to be attached similarly the height of tube  should be equal to but not greater than the thickness of the magazine to be attached thereto in order to optimize space for the distribution of the sample products should the height of tube  exceed the thickness of the magazine binding the magazines will not stack properly on top of each other moreover it will impede distribution thereof or will tend to snag against the edges of other magazines holders thus tearing the magazine or separating the holder from the magazine further the preferred measurements will cause the tube  to look as if it were a natural extension of the magazine itself the width of the tube  should preferably be twice the thickness of the binding of the subject magazine however the width may be reduced in order to house smaller samples or expanded in order to secure additional space provided that the width is not expanded to such an extent as to put undo cantilever stress on the adhesive attachment so as to separate tube  from magazine  the product containers  are adapted to hold the individual product samples and are then inserted into tube  in such embodiment product containers  consist of rectangular cardboard boxes or carded blister pack containers  of a height and width slightly less than that of tube  in order to properly house the particular product sample and protect the sample during shipping and yet retain the ability to be easily slipped in and out of tube  the number of containers  to be enclosed in any particular tube  is dependent upon the dimensions of the product samples themselves and the length of tube  thus for large samples there may be room for only one product container  as an additional means of promoting the product samples enclosed and possibly providing additional incentive for prospective newsstand purchasers the trademark andor logo of the product sample manufacturer may be imprinted upon product container  figs a and b illustrate two alternative embodiments to the carded blister pack containers  carded blister packaging generally consists of a paperboard blister card  and a clear plastic molded blister shell  the plastic blister shell  is molded to conform to the product being packaged the dimensions of the blister card  and plastic blister shell  are sufficiently less than those of the tube so as to allow the carded blister pack containers  to fit within the tube  the plastic blister shell  housing the sample product or promotional material is sealed to the blister card  in alternative embodiments not shown of the present invention product samples may be carried in alternative forms in tube  such alternative forms include but are not limited to single trays which extend the length of the tube openended boxes boxes with window cutouts for viewing the product samples small folding cartons boxes with sleeves and matchboxlike trays a segmented product holder may also be built directly within the cavity of tube  in the preferred embodiment one end of tube  is permanently sealed with a plastic welded end closure  while the other end will remain open to permit easy insertion of product containers  the open end may then be sealed by means of a removable closure plug  closure plug  is adapted to fit snugly into tube  in order to help prevent the product containers from falling out during transport a removable adhesive seal  is then placed over closure plug  and tube  in order to secure closure plug  in place on tube  the use of seal  in connection with closure plug  will also prevent tampering andor premature removal of the product samples in an alternate embodiment not shown both ends of tube  are permanently sealed with plastic welded end closures  tube  is then cut into two sections and the product sample containers  are inserted tube  is then reassembled and the cut is sealed by adhesive means once the product holder tube  has been filled with product sample containers and sealed it is then affixed to the binding of magazine or publication  as noted above this invention is designed to be used in connection with magazines or publications which have a square perfect glued type binding and not the type of binding which is fanfolded and then stapled in the middle tube  is positioned lengthwise adjacent to the binding of publication  and affixed thereto by means of clear adhesive tape  in the preferred embodiment two strips of adhesive tape  are applied at opposite ends of tube  to properly secure tube  in place and to prevent detachment during shipping however the number of strips of adhesive tape  which are to be utilized may vary dependent upon the length and thickness of magazinepublication  clear adhesive tape is also preferred as it will prevent the front cover of the magazine from being obscured thereby preserving the aesthetic newsstand appeal of the publication clear adhesive tape also prevents alteration or modification to the back cover of the magazine thereby preserving same as a prime source of advertising revenue adhesive tape  further comprises two adhesive strips  with a nonadhesive strip  between adhesive strips  this unique design of the adhesive tape  permits the purchaser of the magazine to easily remove the holder  from the magazine  by grasping the tube  and removing the adhesive tape  by the nonadhesive center strip  of adhesive tape  the magazine subscriberpurchaser may then break seal  remove plug  and remove the product containers  it should also be noted that the use of a flexible adhesive tape  to secure the binding product holder to the magazine allows the magazine to be folded or rolled in order to be placed in a subscribers mailbox without damaging the magazine or causing the binding product holder to be damaged or detached having thus described the invention with particular reference to the preferred forms thereof it will be obvious that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims in that regard while the binding product holder of the present invention is intended to be used in connection with a magazine or publication the potential applications of this invention need not be so limited the binding product holder of the instant invention may also be used in connection with virtually any consumer product with a planar siding or binding thus it could also be used in connection with books or publications such as telephone books and corporate annual reports and literature the binding product holder could also be used to attach premiums to cereal boxes or to promote sample pharmaceutical products when attached to boxed medicine packages furthermore the material components of the binding product holder need not be limited to clear plastic various other materials may be utilized depending upon the publication and the products enclosed these materials may be transparent translucent or even opaque and of a variety of colors or thicknesses  previous patent multidirectional ro      next patent

second detroit holster order today paddle for sig p and all i can say is absolutely fantastic work open carried all day in a pair of dickies shorts and no belt and ive never been more comfortable in doing so these two holsters were money well spent and i can’t remember the last time i’ve honestly been this satisfied with a product it’s been a while” adminpaul – july   “i just recently received a pocket holster for my xds in zombie green and i wanted to say i could not be more pleased with the quality attention to detail and quick turn around time on that note i would very much like to order another holster from you i recently purchased a ruger sr for my girlfriend and would like to order a holster for it i did not see it listed as an option on your site if this is a possibility please let me know i also wanted to thank you for the free trigger guard holster you sent me that little guy stays on tight i have and will continue to recommend you and your company to everyone i meet and you can count on my continued patronage” adminpaul – july   “i received my holster today and man i am impressed as a person who has many different holsters multiple raven concealment and bladetech holsters along with all the other usual suspects this one is now one of my favorites ironically today i received a custom holster from raven concealment for a glock  with a surefire x i ordered that holster from them  and that one like the one you made for my sig  were custom orders not quick ship items let me say you got my holster to me faster than they can with their “in stock” items i have ordered in the past the fit and retention on yours is perfect and im sure my neighbors now think im crazy since they all saw me in my garage drawing my sig out of my pocket testing how the hook would work and every time it functioned flawlessly as a typical person who does not like to wait for anything thank you for being so fast with your turn around i can’t even get bladetech to make a holster that fast and they are literally  miles away from me as a fellow craftsman and small business owner and former michigan resident i will do all i can to tell all my friends about you and your products also i love the fact that you give back to your community and help the less fortunate so thanks again and keep up the great work” adminpaul – july   “good looking extremely well made tactical awesome holster thought i couldn’t be more satisfied until i discovered the detroit holster family are bible based this nation needs more companies like you” adminpaul – november   “got my holster today and i couldn’t be more pleased for the last couple of years i have been carrying a snubby revolver as my concealed sidearm during winter i was using a desantis superfly in a coat pocket straight drop in in the spring i moved to a glock  with winter approaching i was looking for a holster was considering the desantis but i really prefer the clean tight fit of kydex i was getting ready to settle for the desantis but did one more web search on pocket holsters for glock decided to look at images and that’s were i found an image of the “john r” when i ordered i was thinking the thumb tab would be handy for my thumb but it turns out that the way the pocket flap on my coat is constructed that all i have to do is grab the grip press in to my side slightly while drawing and the thumb tab hangs on the seam fantastic just wanted to say thanks for a great product wonderfully executed” add a review click here to cancel reply your review name  email  related products dix trigger   hastings owb   dual
