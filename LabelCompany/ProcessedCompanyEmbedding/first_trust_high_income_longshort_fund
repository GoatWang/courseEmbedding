reports forms ncsr and nq that are based on trade date recording of security transactions holdings are subject to change risk considerations investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost the fund invests in noninvestment grade debt instruments commonly referred to as highyield securities high yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings lowerquality debt tends to be less liquid than higherquality debt the debt securities in which the fund invests are subject to certain risks including issuer risk reinvestment risk prepayment risk credit risk and interest rate risk issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixedincome securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the funds portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the fund portfolios current earnings rate prepayment risk is the risk that upon a prepayment the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest andor principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result interest rate risk is the risk that fixedincome securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates in times of unusual or adverse market economic regulatory or political conditions the fund may not be able fully or partially to implement its short selling strategy short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns and may result in greater gains or greater losses the fund invests in securities of nonus issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of us issuers
