president  ceo david field’s midyear letter to the entercom team from elissa gomez i am writing to provide you with my midyear update on entercom and share my thoughts on how we are doing and where we are headed  i am pleased to report that we had a great first half of  achieving strong sales and financial growth and making significant progress in a number of areas to enhance our future our steadfast focus on our core strategies and values is paying off  we have never strayed from our fundamental belief that the key to success in this business is building great local radio brands personalities and content making entercom a great place to work adding powerful local marketing solutions for customers and making a difference in our communities  and the many millions of dollars we are investing in new people brands content technology capabilities benefits and resources are paying off and enhancing our performance allow me to share with you some of the highlights of our recent achievements our stations are strong and growing  over the past couple years our ratings are up doubledigits ranking  among all leading radio broadcasters our revenues are strong and growing  not only have we been consistently  or  among all leading broadcasters over the past year but we are also growing faster than many large growth companies including apple fed ex verizon cisco ebay ralph lauren american express and many more we are financially strong and our stock is now at a sixyear high significantly outperforming the stock market over the past few years a direct reflection of our solid performance and our increasingly bright prospects   and as a reflection of our confidence in our future and our financial strength we launched a dividend on our stock in june in recent months we have added the los angeles rams and san diego padres and some great local shows to our programming lineup  we also expanded smartreach digital into several new markets we are rolling out a number of new world class tools to all of our markets including salesforce a new videobased sales training system and a number of enhancements to our digital platforms our investment in programming innovation has led to exclusive entercom programs with a number of world class artists including chris martin justin timberlake and the red hot chili peppers with a number of other content innovation projects in the pipeline and our recent investment in an entercom marketing team led by our first chief marketing officer will make us a significantly stronger organization in the months and years to come while all of this should make us proud and excited about our future we should also be proud of all the great things we are doing to make a difference for our listeners our customers our communities and for the people on the entercom team entercom stations continue to make a huge impact on the lives of our listeners and our communities in ways large and small  earlier this month johnny dare and the team at the rock in kansas city raised lifesaving funds for an elderly man in dire need of help  that is just one example of the many extraordinary acts we perform throughout the year to make this world a better place collectively we generate well over  million per year in support for wonderful organizations and needy individuals across the country  and we continue to reduce our environmental footprint working to be a good corporate citizen to help ensure a sustainable planet for our children and grandchildren and close to  members of our team have already signed up for our new entercom stock purchase plan which will enable participants to buy our stock at roughly  below its market value   and well over  of the recent graduates on our team have signed up for our student loan payment assistance plan and the news on radio remains excellent  as we all know last year nielsen declared radio to be the  reach medium in the country surpassing tv over the past year as millennials and others are cutting the tv cord in record numbers   and while competitive media are suffering severe disruption from declining usage dvr’s digital fraud and blocking technologies etc radio stands tall as the least disrupted and highest roi medium in the nation radio is winning because we establish powerful personal connections with our listeners providing top notch entertainment information engagement and companionship to the massive  of the population that listens weekly  as sir richard branson explains “people want personality local insight and a feeling of connection – all qualities great dj’s on radio stations can share and streaming sites can’t duplicate” we should all feel very good about our recent performance   but as we take pride in our accomplishments and progress we also recognize that in this hypercompetitive world of constant change any organization that isn’t getting better every day will ultimately fall behind and fail  what was good enough to win yesterday won’t be good enough tomorrow  as a company we are making huge investments in people content capabilities and other important areas to ensure that we grow thrive and succeed in the years ahead  and as individuals each of us must also commit ourselves to advancing our knowledge skills and capabilities in order to keep pace or risk falling behind  we should all heed the words of the late great vince

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
