parties and witnesses in the interest of justice a district court may transfer any civil matter to any other district or division where it might have been brought  usc § a the purpose of § a is to prevent the waste of time energy and money and to protect litigants witnesses and the public against unnecessary inconvenience and expense van dusen v barrack  us    internal citations and quotation omitted a motion for transfer lies within the broad discretion of the district court and must be determined on an individualized basis see jones v gnc franchising inc  fd   th cir  to support a motion for transfer the moving party must establish  that venue is proper in the transferor district  that the transferee district is one where the action might have been brought and  that the transfer will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and will promote the interest of justice goodyear tire  rubber co v mcdonnell douglas corp  fsupp   cd cal  courts evaluate the following factors to determine which venue is more convenient to the parties and the witnesses  plaintiffs choice of forum  convenience of the parties  convenience of the witnesses  ease of access to the evidence  familiarity of each forum with the applicable law  feasibility of consolidation with other claims  any local interest in the controversy and  the relative court congestion and time of trial in each forum see williams v bowman  fsuppd   nd cal  see also jones v gnc franchising inc  fd   th cir  the court has broad discretion to address these factors based on the particular facts of each case e  j gallo winery v f  p spa  fsupp   ed cal  discussion clearplay has filed a motion pursuant to  usc § a to have this case transferred to the district of utah clearplay argues that utah is a more convenient district for this litigation because the parties and relevant witnesses are located in utah and all of the facts giving rise to this dispute occurred in utah clearplay argues that the northern district has little to no connection to this case and that it would be inconvenient for the parties to litigate this case from their headquarters in utah the court agrees as an initial matter the court finds that this case could have been filed in the district of utah the governing venue statute for patent infringement actions provides that venue is proper in the judicial district where the defendant resides or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business  usc § b  a defendant is deemed to reside in any judicial district in which it is subject to the courts personal jurisdiction  usc § c ve holding corp  fd at  vidangel does not dispute that this case could have been brought in utah the court also finds that utah is significantly more convenient for the parties and the witnesses the record shows that the parties their employees and corporate documents are located in utah in addition all of the inventors of the patentsinsuit reside in utah the developer of vidangels source code lives in utah and mr jarman states that he is presently unaware of any factual witness who could likely be called in this matter who does not reside in the state of utah jarman decl ¶¶  docket no  in contrast vidangel has not identified any specific witnesses who may have relevant information and who are in the northern district vidangels ceo neal harmon filed a declaration stating inter alia that vidangel has substantial business contacts with companies in the northern district of california including its mobile solutions provider for crossplatform development two venture capital companies its remarketing advertising provider its payment gateway provider and its current streaming content and tv technology providers harmon decl ¶  however mr harmon does not identify any specific individuals from these companies who may have information relevant to the parties claims or defenses see williams  f supp d at  absent a more specific showing that particular witnesses will be necessary at trial the court cannot consider the convenience of these unnamed witnesses mr harmon also states that vidangels software code database is hosted by a company based in san francisco id however as clearplay notes vidangels counsel confirmed that vidangels software code can be viewed anywhere and thus the location of vidangels software code database is irrelevant to the § a analysis docket no  moreover the fact that vidangel requires all disputes between itself and its customers to be arbitrated or litigated in provo utah strongly indicates that vidangel generally finds utah to be a convenient forum for disputes arising from its business plaintiff argues that the court should not disturb its choice of forum there is ordinarily a strong presumption in favor of a plaintiffs choice of forum piper aircraft co v reyno  us    however where a plaintiff does not reside in the forum the court may afford plaintiffs choice considerably less weight see schwarzer et al federal civil procedure before trial §   citing in re apple inc  fd   th cir  piper aircraft  us at  see also matt v baxter healthcare corp  fsuppd   ed pa  a locale that is not the home of the plaintiff and where few of the operative facts occurred is entitled to less weight in addition vidangel does not dispute that the facts giving rise to this dispute occurred in utah indeed vidangel does not allege that any of the operative facts took place in the northern district of california accordingly the court finds that plaintiffs choice of forum is entitled to significantly less weight in the transfer analysis the other factors the court considers when deciding a motion to transfer include the familiarity of each forum with the applicable law the feasibility of consolidation with other claims any local interest in the controversy and the relative court congestion and time of trial in each forum the parties agree that these factors are neutral in the transfer analysis with the exception of the local interest in the controversy clearplay argues that the northern district has no interest in this controversy because the parties are from utah and the operative facts occurred in utah while vidangel argues that the northern district has a significant local interest due to vidangels extensive business dealings in the northern district docket no  at  the court agrees with clearplay that the local interest in this controversy is much stronger in utah where the parties have their headquarters and where the facts giving rise to the complaint occurred conclusion for the foregoing reasons the court grants defendants motion to transfer venue and hereby transfers this action to the district of utah docket no  the court grants defendants motions to file overlarge briefs docket nos  and  the court transfers clearplays consolidated motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to be considered by the transferee court in the first instance it is so ordered footnotes  defendant has also filed a consolidated motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in light of the courts transfer of this case to the district of utah the court does not rule on the motion for a temporary restraining order  mr harmon states that vidangel is currently recruiting an engineer from the san francisco area to lead its technology strategy — this engineer is expected to join shortly and will be based in san francisco harmon decl ¶  however as clearplay notes this unidentified engineer has yet to be hired and in any event vidangel does not state what information this engineer would have that is relevant to the claims or defenses in this case comment your name your email comments

cases of interest disney enterprises inc v vidangel inc usdc central district of california december   in depth click here to download a pdf of the full decision district court grants four major movie studios’ request for injunction against streaming service that filters out objectionable content for customers finding that studios were likely to succeed on their dmca and copyright infringement claims major film studios disney enterprises inc lucasfilm ltd llc twentieth century fox film corporation and warner bros entertainment inc sued vidangel inc an unlicensed videoondemand streaming service that allows customers to filter out objectionable content and stream a movie or television show through vidangel after purchasing a physical dvd or bluray disc through the service the studios alleged that vidangel violated their rights pursuant to §a of the digital millennium copyright act dmca and under § of the copyright act and moved for a preliminary injunction vidangel inc operates an unlicensed videoondemand streaming service for movies and television shows that filters out objectionable content as directed by customers to watch a movie or television show on vidangel a customer must first purchase a physical copy in dvd or disc format from vidangel and then choose the type of content within the work to be filtered out such as nudity or obscene language before receiving video available for streaming customers may or may not choose to receive a physical copy of the video once the video has been streamed and watched the user can resell it to vidangel for a partial credit the district court granted plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction finding that the studios had shown a “strong likelihood of success” on the merits of their dmca and copyright claims the dmca provides that “no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title” the studios argued that vidangel circumvented the technological protections on their dvds or discs by decrypting the dvds or discs for purposes of uploading onto a computer in the process removing restrictions on encryption vidangel argued that this activity didn’t amount to circumvention because it was only decrypting dvds to allow them to be viewed in another way a procedure known as reformatting or “spaceshifting” and that spaceshifting is legal when performed for disc purchasers who elect to have their dvd content streamed rather than receiving the physical discs the court rejected vidangel’s argument that the dmca exempted spaceshifting finding that section aa of the dmca exempts from liability those “who would ‘decrypt’ an encrypted dvd with the authority of a copyright owner not those who would ‘view’ a dvd with the authority of a copyright owner” according to the court the purchase of a dvd conveys only the authority to view the dvd not to decrypt it and vidangel had not offered any evidence that the studios have either explicitly or implicitly authorized dvd or disc buyers to circumvent encryption technology in order to view the dvd or disc on a different platform such as vidangel’s streaming service the district court also rejected vidangel’s argument that the family home movie act fma expressly allows a third party to filter and transmit content as specified by a lawful owner of a copy as long as a fixed copy of the altered content is not created noting that the argument was unsupported by the clear language of the statute and that the legislative history directly contradicted vidangel’s argument that the fmc provided an exemption to the anticircumvention provisions of the dmca the studios also asserted that vidangel violated two of their exclusive rights under the copyright act the right to reproduce their works by making copies and the right to publicly perform their copyrighted works with respect to the reproduction right vidangel admitted to making copies of plaintiffs’ works onto a computer system and thirdparty servers but argued that they are only “intermediate” copies and therefore not protected by the copyright act the district court rejected the argument that intermediate copying was not prohibited by the copyright act pointing out that “in order to constitute a ‘copy’ for purposes of the copyright act the allegedly infringing work must be fixed in some tangible form ‘from which the work can be perceived reproduced or otherwise communicated either directly or with the aid of a machine or device’” vidangel’s fragmented copies may not be able to be perceived directly by consumers but they can be perceived with the aid of vidangel’s software noted the district court and the copying performed by vidangel falls within the category of acts proscribed by the statute with respect to the public performance right vidangel argued that it does not engage in public performances because it streams only filtered versions of works created at the direction of and owned by its customers in so arguing vidangel relied on language in the supreme court’s  decision in am broad cos v aereo inc stating that a transmission of a copyrighted program is not made to “the public” when it is made “to those who act as owners or possessors of the relevant product” however even assuming arguendo that vidangel’s buysellback service creates a valid ownership interest in a dvd the district court found that this ownership would apply only to the physical dvd or disc and not to the digital content that vidangel streams to paying subscribers vidangel subscribers view the stream from a master copy stored on a server not from a dvd or disc “temporarily” owned by the user the district court again rejected vidangel’s arguments under the fma finding that the fma exempts only i the “making imperceptible” of limited portions of a motion picture and ii the “creation or provision of a computer program or other technology that enables such making imperceptible”  usc §  according to the court the statute clearly requires that a performance or transmission of filtered content must come from an “authorized copy” of the motion picture but the digital content that vidangel streams to its customers is not from an authorized copy — rather it streams from a digital copy that it acquires by circumventing technological protection measures on the studios’ dvds finally the district court rejected vidangel’s “fair use” defense finding that its commercial use of the copyrighted works was not “transformative” because it did not add anything to the studios’ works and simply omitted a small percentage that viewers found objectionable in granting the preliminary injunction the district court found that studios demonstrated a likelihood of imminent irreparable injury it noted that the studios strategically release their content across different distribution channels and to different licensees to generate revenue on their movies and television shows and negotiate exclusive time windows for performing a title with different licensees the studios maintained that vidangel interferes with their right to control how and through which channels consumers can view their copyright work because vidangel operates without a license and performs the studios’ works during the exclusive period which frustrates the studios’ ability to negotiate for similar rights in the future in addition vidangel’s actions threatened to harm the studios’ relationships and goodwill with authorized distributors the district court noted accordingly the district court enjoined vidangel from  circumventing technological measures protecting the studios’ copyrighted works on dvds bluray discs or any other medium  copying the studios’ copyrighted works including but not limited to copying the works onto computers or servers and  streaming transmitting or otherwise publicly performing or displaying any of the studios’ copyrighted works over the internet

through applications on devices such as iphones ipads android devices smartphones or tablets via media streaming devices such as roku chromecast or apple tv or by means of any other device or process

march    am edt by benzinga shutterstock photo by jim probascoaccording to cofounder neal harmon “vidangel lets you watch movies and tv shows however the bleep you want” vidangel is a video streaming service that applies filters chosen by you designed to cut out language nudity or other potentially offensive contentincredibly vidangel’s business model makes it possible to watch fulllength filtered movies and television shows for as little as  per night – thanks to a unique “buy and sell back” programbenzinga spoke with harmon who shared the story of the founding of the company and how the entire operation works for one of the most innovative video streaming services available todaybenzinga can you share a little of your background and history before vidangelneal harmon sure i was cofounder of a company called orabrush which was named one of the top  youtube marketing campaigns of the decadeafter that my brother jeffrey and i did a marketing campaign for poopourri that was in the top  campaigns for we started a marketing agency and because we have young children realized some of the media content creators we love don’t share our values in terms of what we wanted our kids to seei played with various apis building a filter on a movie and it worked nobody else built the product so we didwhen did vidangel actually become an entity was it a fast moving processoh yeah we’ve had a rollercoaster ride in october  we built out a proof of concept and in  we launched an mvp minimum viable productwe got lots of customer feedback and then after the supreme court ruling on aereo we got the idea for vidangel we rebuilt the product in late  started private beta testing in january  and made the product open to the public in august so what is vidangel and how does it workour tagline is “watch movies and tv shows however the bleep you want”that means you can watch any movie you own on any device you want to and customized the way you want to watch it for example if you don’t want to see jar jar binks in star wars you can set a filter to cut out jar jar binksif you don’t want to see nudity in game of thrones you can cut that out you have the power to watch the movie however you wantis this similar to redbox only with filtersactually it’s the opposite of redbox with redbox you rent the movie and pay for it every day if you forget to take it back you end up paying for and owning itwith vidangel you buy the movie up front for  that’s because you have to own it for us to be able to filter your steam for you after you watch it you can keep it or you can sell it back the sellback price is  for sd and  for hd so it is essentially  per night for sd and  per night for hd with sellbackvidangelcom new releases sectiontalk a little bit about the filters who creates them how do they workwe have a chrome extension that allows members to create their own filters but it’s not very well built out ultimately that’s where we want to get to people just tag the movie however they want create filters however they want and share those filters however they wantuntil then we have a small community of people all over the country that tag movies in preparation for them to be published on vidangelif you go on vidangel you have a set of five tag options including sex and nudity violence language alcohol and drug content and miscellaneous content which includes things like opening credits ending credits and jar jar and all that kind of stuffas a member you create your own filter based on those five tagswhat about an indicator or key to age appropriatenessour members can use the mpaa ratings that come with the movie those ratings are owned by the motion picture association of america so we can’t tell our community to “turn this rated r movie to pg” that would be illegalwe can list the original rating and then someone can go in and apply a filter for what they want to adjust in order to show the movie to their familiesin addition we are collecting data as people finish their movies on what they felt like the age appropriateness was when we have enough of that data collected we may start publishing our own age appropriateness ratingsdo you have any data on how big your potential customer base is in other words is there a need for a product like thisbefore we started this business we surveyed general americans in addition we talked to an adviser who owned a movie editing company he said  of americans would want to watch edited versions of movies we did a survey years later and found the number to be if you charge people to use a filter the market shrinks to less than  of americans but if you empower them by letting them own a movie it becomes a much larger marketeach movie is a commercial business they cut different versions of “the wolf of wall street” for china and for the middle east and for the airlines vidangel is a tool for a family cut who better to decide what the family cut should look like than the family themselveswe believe in allowing our customers to watch movies however they want if you want filters vidangel is your place to do it if you want to watch without filters we recommend one of the unfiltered streaming serviceshow do people find out what movies and tv shows are available through vidangeljust go to the website and sign up free from there you can see everything available we have more than  titles currently and are adding about  per weekwe offer the most popular tv shows movies and classic movies and we solicit and accept customer requests brand new movies with over  million domestic sales are offered automaticallydoes everything go through the same process in terms of filtering or does it depend on the movie or tv showwe created tagging training videos to give our community a common language such things as “what does graphic violence mean” i’m amazed for example at how many tags there are on the move “minions” or “inside out”you would think there is nothing in those movies that should be filtered but there could be someone who objects to body humor or a character talking back to their parents the tagging community is way more sensitive for content rated for a younger groupall content goes through a fourstage process – a tagger a reviewer a publisher and an internal review before it is published on our website those are unique people with no one person doing any two of those stepssome tags are labeled “plot essential” if those tags are applied the storyline could be affected people have to make that decision for themselves – whether or not to potentially affect the plot of the movie or tv showwhat about reaction from movie studios and the movie industry at largewe’ve communicated with all the movie studios about what we are doing about how we make them money about how our system works and the reaction has been professional so far the studios have not had any complaintsi’m not sure directors love the altering of their work by individuals
