healthcare venture fund is guided by quadruple aim  mobihealthnews skip to main content toggle navigation dave chases new healthcare venture fund is guided by quadruple aimby jonah comstockmay   share healthcare investor and serial entrepreneur dave chase has launched a venture fund called the hf quad aim fund the fund will focus specifically on supporting companies facilitating the transition from volume to valuebased care while bolstering the quadruple aim  chases expanded version of the wellknown triple aim in healthcare his includes caregiver experience alongside patient experience improved outcomes and lower costs the fund expects to raise  million while it may seem like an obvious approach chase says a lot of health tech companies dont think about how their product addresses those four points and they often end up creating tech solutions that actually make life harder for doctors as a result the first thing i learned as a new consultant at accenture was fix the process before you put technology on top of it chase told mobihealthnews if you have the right process technology can supercharge it but in healthcare if you look at a typical doctor and ask them whether information technology has helped them to be a better doctor and do their job better i think you know the answer to that although the fund is new  it is currently investing in just three companies  the ideas behind it have been brewing for a long time the investment thesis grows out of chases health rosetta an open source platform for ideas about making valuebased care work theres a tightrope to be walked he says between being an innovator that doesnt understand the complexities of healthcare and being a healthcare insider that cant think outside of the box and innovate the broad overarching theme of the companies we’re investing in is that they understand the idiosyncrasies of healthcare without being shackled by them he said we found that most startups are blind to or dismissive of those idiosyncrasies and that’s their deathknell or established players trying to compete on innovation find themselves so shackled by those idiosyncrasies that they don’t see new opportunities or they don’t understand cloudbased economics our companies walk that fine line of understanding idiosyncrasies without being shackled by them the funds initial three portfolio companies include cova care coordination company vizi and direct pay billing company hint health additionally hf quad aim fund will draw on healthfundrs network of experts across the country  they currently have   who will be available both to advise companies and to help vet potential investments chase also stressed the importance of looking beyond silicon valley for good healthcare ideas  while i’m certain that there will be at some point there’s yet to be a great health it company that’s come out of silicon valley if you look at the highly successful companies they’re based in wisconsin and massachusetts and illinois  and not silicon valley the thing we recognize is great companies are everywhere and the funding environment is really bad outside of silicon valley boston and new york chase founded avado an
