are the representations of the companys management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations the results for the period from july   inception to september   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending december   use of estimates the preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from

street acquisition corporation notes to unaudited condensed financial statements income taxes under asc  income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of sesptember   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration loss per common share basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity as of september   there are no outstanding dilutive securities fair value of financial instruments the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments recent accounting pronouncements on november   fasb issued asuincome taxes the board is issuing this update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards the simplification initiative the objective of the simplification initiative is to identify evaluate and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles gaap for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements current gaap requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a taxpaying component of an entity be offset and presented as

llc as described below this loan will be repaid out of the gross proceeds of this offering  includes deferred underwriting discounts and commissions equal to  of the gross proceeds from the sale of the units to the public stockholders or   if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full which will be deposited in the trust account and which the underwriters have agreed to defer until the consummation of our initial business combination if we consummate an initial business combination   if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full will be paid to the underwriters as deferred discounts and commissions subject to a  per share reduction for public stockholders who exercise their conversion rights  these expenses include any reimbursements to be made to our executive officers and directors for outofpocket expenses incurred by them in performing due diligence and activities in connection with the evaluation of a potential business combination as well as any potential fees that we may pay to third parties such as market research firms and other consultants that perform due diligence of a target business on our behalf other than to the extent such fees are paid by our executive officers and directors on our behalf and such persons are reimbursed in the amount and to the extent of such fees  the not yet identified miscellaneous expenses include without limitation the reimbursement of our executive officers and directors for outofpocket expenses in connection with this offering such as roadshow expenses and advances for offering costs made by them and not covered by the amounts set aside for offering expenses set forth on the table above and costs and expenses associated with our dissolution and liquidation we intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units in this offering and the sale of warrants in the private placement to acquire one or more operating businesses in the business services industry after nondeferred expenses of this offering and the private placement  or  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full will be placed in a trust account maintained by continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee except for payment of taxes and interest income earned net of taxes payable on the trust account of up to  to fund our working capital requirements the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the consummation of an initial business combination or our dissolution and liquidation during the month period following completion of the offering the amount that may be distributed to us to fund our working capital requirements will be limited to the greater of  of the interest income earned net of taxes payable and  we expect to use the proceeds held in the trust account to acquire one or more domestic or foreign operating businesses in the business services industry interest earned on the trust account net of taxes payable will be held in the trust account for use in consummating an initial business combination or released to investors upon exercise of their conversion rights or upon our dissolution and liquidation as the case may be however we may not use all of the funds remaining in the trust account in connection with a business combination either because the consideration for the initial business combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities in that event the remaining proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will constitute working capital for our business after our initial business combination while it is difficult to determine what the specific operating expenses of our business after consummation of an initial business combination may be we expect that they may include some or all of the following capital expenditures general ongoing expenses including overhead payroll and costs involved in expanding markets and in developing strategic acquisitions or alliances in addition we may use any remaining proceeds held in the trust account to satisfy any unpaid reimbursable outofpocket expenses incurred by our executive officers and directors as well as any unpaid finder’s fees or similar fees or compensation to the extent such expenses fees or compensation exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account if we consummate an initial business combination  or  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full will be paid to the underwriters as deferred discounts and compensation as set forth in this prospectus subject to a  per share reduction for public stockholders who exercise their conversion rights net proceeds of this offering and the private placement in the amount of  will not be held in the trust account and may be used to fund our operations up to the next  months as described below we expect to use approximately  for legal accounting and other expenses attendant to the structuring and negotiation of an initial business combination  for expenses related to due diligence and investigation of prospective target businesses and  for legal and accounting fees relating to sec reporting obligations we expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all members of our executive officers and directors and may include engaging market research and valuation firms as well as other thirdparty consultants none of our executive officers or directors will receive any compensation for any due diligence efforts other than reimbursement of any outofpocket expenses they may incur on our behalf while performing due diligence of prospective target businesses any reimbursement of outofpocket expenses would occur at our discretion to the extent such outofpocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account such outofpocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless and until we consummate a business combination we have agreed to pay union street capital management llc a monthly fee of  for general and administrative services including office space utilities and secretarial support we believe that based on rents and fees for similar services in alexandria virginia the fees charged by union street capital management llc are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from unaffiliated third parties we expect to use approximately  for premiums for director and officer insurance for a month period in addition we have reserved approximately  for the payment of corporate franchise taxes we intend to use the excess working capital approximately  for other expenses incurred in structuring and negotiating an initial business combination and if necessary to cover the costs and expenses associated with our dissolution and liquidation which we estimate would be in the range of  to  for example we may opt to make a deposit or down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with structuring and negotiating our initial business combination while we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms that specialize in business acquisitions we may do so in the future to assist us in locating suitable target businesses in which event we may pay a finder’s fee or other compensation we have not reserved any specific amounts for a deposit down payment exclusivity fees finder’s fees or similar fees or compensation each of which may have the effect of reducing the available net proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment of our ongoing expenses and reimbursement of outofpocket expenses incurred on our behalf to the extent that any such fees or compensation exceeds the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account we would not be able to pay such fees or compensation unless we consummate an initial business combination in addition the excess working capital will be used to cover miscellaneous expenses that we have not yet identified which may include without limitation the reimbursement of our executive officers and directors for outofpocket expenses in connection with this offering such as roadshow expenses and advances for offering costs made by them and not covered by the amounts set aside for offering expenses described above we believe that upon consummation of this offering and the private placement we will have sufficient available funds to operate at least for the next  months assuming that an initial business combination is not consummated during that time the amount of available proceeds is based on the executive officers’ and directors’ estimate of the amount needed to fund our operations for the next  months and to consummate a business combination those estimates may prove inaccurate especially if a portion of the available proceeds is used to make a deposit or down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with an initial business combination or if we expend a significant portion of the available proceeds in pursuit of an initial business combination that is not consummated if our estimates prove inaccurate our ability to consummate an initial business combination may be impaired and if we are required to dissolve and liquidate upon our failure to complete a business combination the amount distributed to our public stockholders could be subject to reduction compared to our estimates as a result of the claims of creditors however if we do not have sufficient proceeds available to cover our expenses we may be required to obtain additional financing either from our executive officers and directors union street capital management llc or third parties we may not be able to obtain additional financing and none of our management including our executive officers and directors our existing stockholders or union street capital management llc is obligated to provide any additional financing if we do not have sufficient proceeds not held in the trust account and cannot find additional financing we may be required to dissolve and liquidate prior to consummating an initial business combination union street capital management llc has loaned a total of  to us for the payment of offering expenses the loan is interest free and will be paid upon the completion of this offering out of the gross proceeds the net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held in the trust account and invested only in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a promulgated under the  act or securities issued by the united states so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the  act other than i the repayment of the  loan described above and ii administrative services arrangement for services rendered to us no compensation of any kind including finder’s and consulting fees will be paid to any of our executive officers directors or existing stockholders or any of their respective affiliates prior to or in connection with the initial business combination however our executive officers and directors will receive reimbursement for any outofpocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf such as participating in the offering process identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations since the role of our current executive officers and directors after an initial business combination is uncertain we have no ability to determine what remuneration if any will be paid to those persons after an initial business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account including interest earned on its pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account net of taxes payable and after release of up to  of interest income after tax to fund working capital requirements including the costs of our dissolution and liquidation only in the event of our dissolution and liquidation upon our failure to consummate an initial business combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert shares into cash in connection with our initial business combination that the public stockholder previously voted against and which we actually consummate in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for an initial business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and consummating business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us while we believe there are numerous potential target businesses with which we could combine our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing an initial business combination with a target business in addition • the requirement that we obtain stockholder approval of an initial business combination and audited and perhaps interimunaudited financial information to be included in the proxy statement to be sent to stockholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the consummation of a transaction • the conversion of common stock held by our public stockholders into cash may reduce the resources available to us to fund an initial business combination • our outstanding warrants and the dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses and • the requirement to acquire assets or an operating business that has a fair market value at least equal to  of the balance in the trust account less the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable at the time of the initial business combination could require us to acquire several assets or closely related operating businesses at the same time all of which sales would be contingent on the closings of the other sales which could make it more difficult to consummate the initial business combination any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination our executive officers and directors believes however that a privately held target business may view our status as a wellfinanced public entity as offering advantages over other entities that have a business objective similar to ours identifying executing and realizing attractive returns on business combinations is highly competitive and involves a high degree of uncertainty we expect to encounter intense competition for potential target businesses from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including venture capital funds leveraged buyout funds operating businesses and other entities and individuals both foreign and domestic many of these competitors are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and consummating business combinations directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources than we do and or financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors furthermore over the past several years other “blank check” companies have been formed and a number of such companies have grown in size for the purpose of investing in the business service and related industries additional investment funds and blank check companies with similar investment objectives as ours may be formed in the future by other unrelated parties and these funds and companies may have substantially more capital and may be able to have access to and utilize additional financing on more attractive terms while we believe that there are numerous potential target businesses with which we could combine using the net proceeds of this offering together with additional financing if available our ability to compete in combining with certain sizeable target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing an initial business combination with certain target businesses in addition • the requirement that we obtain stockholder approval of an initial business combination may delay or prevent the consummation of an initial business combination within the month or month time periods • the requirement that we prepare audited and perhaps interimunaudited financial information to be included in the proxy statement to be sent to stockholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the consummation of a transaction • the conversion of common stock held by our public stockholders into cash may reduce the resources available to us to fund an initial business combination • our outstanding warrants and the dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses and • the requirement to acquire assets or an operating business that have a fair market value at least equal to  of the balance in the trust account less the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable at the time of the initial business combination could require us to acquire several assets or closely related operating businesses at the same time all of which sales would be contingent on the closings of the other sales which could make it more difficult to consummate the initial business combination any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in consummating an initial business combination on favorable terms or at all if we succeed in consummating an initial business combination there will in all likelihood be intense competition from competitors of the target businesses in particular certain industries that experience rapid growth frequently attract an increasingly larger number of competitors including competitors with increasingly greater financial marketing technical human and other resources than the initial competitors in the industry the degree of competition characterizing the industry of any prospective target business cannot presently be ascertained we cannot assure you that subsequent to an initial business combination we will have the resources to compete effectively especially to the extent that the acquired businesses are in highgrowth industries company description we are a recently organized blank check company formed for the purpose of acquiring through a business combination one or more operating businesses in the business services industry in north america to date our efforts have been limited solely to organizational activities the business services industry a subset of the services sector encompasses companies that undertake the management delivery or operation of one or more business processes or functions of other companies among the areas that we intend to focus on are marketing services business information services human capital management facilities and logistics services and professional services we do not have any specific business combination under consideration and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf contacted any prospective target business or had any discussions formal or otherwise with respect to such a transaction we have not nor have any of our agents or affiliates been approached by any prospective target business or representatives of any prospective target business with respect to a possible business combination with our company additionally we have not nor has anyone on our behalf taken any measure directly or indirectly to identify or locate a specific target business nor have we engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate a specific target business we intend to direct our efforts on identifying target companies in the business services industry that have at least one of the following characteristics • a strong fundamental undercapitalized business with the potential to further grow its services products brands andor geographic reach • a valuable asset embedded in an underperforming business that would be more effectively utilized by improved management or technological or operational improvements and • a service or product offering that may be enhanced by one or more “bolt on” acquisitions to complete the service or product offering of a target company we believe that the skills and experience of our executive officers will be crucial to consummating a successful business combination our executive officers and directors have over  years of collective experience and a proven track record of advising acquiring building operating and selling public and private business services companies our team includes • a clayton perfall our chairman chief executive officer and president is chief executive officer of ahl services inc and for four years was the chief financial officer of snyder communications inc he has served on the board of directors of companies sponsored by the carlyle group bain capital and gtcr golder rauner • brian h burke our chief financial officer treasurer and

matthew c fletchall our vicepresident of corporate development and secretary was vice president of corporate development of ahl services inc he has been a colleague of both mr perfall and mr burke since  • john t schwieters our director as vice chairman of perseus llc is involved in sourcing acquiring operating and selling middlemarket businesses he is also a director of manor care inc smithfield foods danaher corporation and choice hotels international and the former managing partner of arthur andersen’s midatlantic region • eran broshy our director is the chairman and chief executive officer of inventiv health inc nasdaq vtiv a leading provider of outsourced clinical communications and commercial services to the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry inventiv was recently ranked number  on fortune magazine’s  fastestgrowing companies listing for  • david b kay our director as managing director of navigant consulting leads a practice that provides financial accounting and operational consulting services to large complex multinational companies our executive officers and directors have built and maintained extensive networks of relationships that we plan to use to identify and generate acquisition opportunities these relationships include among other sources executives and board members at public and private companies business brokers private equity and venture capital firms consultants investment bankers attorneys and accountants our executive officers currently intend to stay involved in our management following an initial business combination the roles that they will assume will depend on the type of business with which we combine and the specific skills and depth of the target company’s management if one or more of our executive officers remain with our company we may enter into employment or other compensation arrangements with them following an initial business combination the terms of which have not yet been determined while we may seek to consummate business combinations with more than one target business our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses whose fair market value is at least equal to  of the balance in the trust account less the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable at the time of such acquisition as a result we expect that an initial public offering of  will enable us to consummate an initial business combination with a business whose fair market value is at least  the actual amount of consideration which we will be able to pay for the initial business combination will depend on whether we choose or are able to pay a portion of the initial business combination consideration with shares of our common stock or if we are able to finance a portion of the consideration with debt or equity financing no financing arrangements have been entered into or contemplated with any third parties to raise any additional funds whether through the sale of securities or otherwise that we may need if we decide to consummate an initial business combination for consideration in excess of our available assets at the time of acquisition we were organized and sponsored by union street capital management llc a delaware limited liability company owned and controlled by our executive officers which has as its members family trusts affiliated
