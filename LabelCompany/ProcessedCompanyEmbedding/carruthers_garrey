governor of new mexico a report on new mexico for the tobacco industry notes the ti lobbylist does not anticipate any significant tort reform activity in  collateral sources may be given consideration as may insurance regulation or workers compensation issues there is virtually no chance that product liability proposals will be introduced or could move in  governor carruthers sees tort reform as valuable to economic development but he is not actively pushing for reforms in  his effectiveness in promoting legislation is questionable the speaker of the house is firmly opposed the tort and product liability reform he is backed by the trial lawyers and the aflcio the new mexico alliance for tort reform worked for  legislation but considers  an unlikely year for action due to the time constraint the institute lobbyist barberousse works this issue through his representation of the association of independent insurers the industry has not been approached for coalition support

the american scientific community is very concerned that public confidence in scientific research is being seriously eroded by policy makers who use scientific findings to conform to political agendas according to a poll sponsored by the advancement of sound science coalition tassc the poll conducted by the tarrance group of houston texas showed that  percent of scientists believe public confidence in scientific research has decreased in the last  years and  percent agree that policy makers use science to achieve their policy goals in controversial issues such as asbestos pesticides dioxin environmental tobacco smoke or water quality ed goeas president and ceo of the tarrance group also attended the news conference and said overall researchers are critical of the need for more stringent adherence to scientific principles and a thorough review process of research these data clearly indicate widespread concern over how scientific research is conducted why it is conducted and how it is used in the formation of public policy after months of research and  development the advancement of sound science coalition tassc issued its five guiding scientific principles to offer a standard against which policymakers should measure research the tassc member scientists who assisted in drafting our statement of principles are  dr james e enstrom university of california at los angeles

genealogy web sites we have recently become aware of three websites purporting to allow family history research searchyourgenealogycom ancestrysearchcom and australianancestrycom  the sites claim to have “the largest online genealogical search tool” and promote themselves as the foremost resources for genealogy but from what we can tell these sites are nothing more than a series of web pages with links to other services  these sites in our opinion are clearly fraudulent  on each site potential customers are lured to purchase under what we feel to be false misleading and deceitful promotional material and get little or no value out of money spent at the websites  blog and message board posts from the community confirm this opinion  the peoplecompanies behind the websites are buying very high level paid search results on google and other sites  in addition they are using trademarks of wellknown websites including ancestrycom and genealogycom to get higherthannormal natural search results  it appears the site colors fonts and pictures on at least one site are designed to mislead people in to believing the site is related to ancestrycom  we want to encourage consumers to validate and verify the legitimacy of a website before providing credit card information or paying for services httpblogsancestrycomancestrypotentiallyfraudulentsitesposingasgenealogywebsites
