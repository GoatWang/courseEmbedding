of mueller water products inc plunged  today weak international sales spooked investors and sent mueller water products shares lower to end the week travis hoium tmfflushdraw apr   at pm what happened  shares of mueller water products inc nysemwa fell as much as  in trading on friday after the company reported fiscal secondquarter results at  pm edt shares were still down  on the day  so what net sales were up  to  million and adjusted income from continuing operations were up  to  million or  per share mueller technologies drove the growth with a  increase in sales to  million offset by a small decline in mueller co sales to  million  image source getty images earnings per share hit analyst estimates on the market but there was an expectation that mueller would report  million in sales for the quarter the miss on the top line is likely what traders are focused on today  now what management said that bad weather in the western us and weak international sales were the drivers of the worsethanexpected quarter the weather was a temporary setback but lagging international sales may be a longterm concern for investors with weak growth and an uncertain international segment i dont think shares look very attractive at  times this years earnings estimates for that reason this isnt a discount i will be jumping on today  travis hoium has no position in any stocks mentioned the
