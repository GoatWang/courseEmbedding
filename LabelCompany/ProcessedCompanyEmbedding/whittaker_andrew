poole whittaker’s  stoppress stoppressmarketing advertising  media intelligence horses mouth holly whittaker and philip poole whittaker’s horses mouthjune  stoppress teamfor  years the whittaker name has been synonymous with chocolate in new zealand but rather than resting on tradition the small team has developed new products collaborated with other brands including the recently leaked jelly tip block and consequently left consumers curious about what will come next here are a few family secretson family heritagephilip poole head of marketing pp the company was founded in  by james henry whittaker brian and andrew whittaker own the company now and they are third generation whittakers holly and matt whittaker are also in the company so there is a fourth generation there so the dynasty lives on as it were it’s very important because with brian and andrew for example they’re still very much involved with the business they still get into the factory at  in the morning and make sure everything is set up correctly they are very handson particularly in terms of the factory and that translates into the quality of the chocolate they’re absolutely rigorous about producing premium quality chocolate because we operate in a very competitive market we’re up against cadbury nestle lindt which are all major multinationals and very good blue chip companies and the thing we need to do is make sure we do everything better than them otherwise we won’t prosper we certainly have an ambition to be the best it also gives you consistency we have a very clear vision which is ‘the world eating worldclass chocolate from porirua’ holly whittaker marketing manager hw having a family heritage is a real point of difference and an advantage over the other competitors in the market it creates consumer trust and loyalty because there’s a connection to new zealand we are a new zealand family and a new zealandrun business so that resonates with the new zealand consumer very positively  on a changing marketpp the main thing that has changed over time is the building of the company brian and andrew have invested a huge amount in the factory and the machinery today is worldclass they’ve also really expanded a company that was originally based on the peanut slab until about ten to  years ago since then the company has really developed into other areas like the blocks squares chunks and so forth they’ve really developed the product range i would say that the product strategy is where the biggest change has occurred   on the younger generations talking to the mediapp brian and andrew are just very private people and they prefer to remain private but with matt and holly coming in at a time when the business is expanding so much it’s a chance to introduce them to consumers hw i guess we see the media as positive opportunity and not so much as a threat and in the last few years we’ve seen how much value it has added to the business by engaging with the media because we are a family business there are personalities involved and by putting a face to the name so to speak it builds a stronger rapport so it’s really proving a successful strategyon being a trusted brandpp we are a familyowned new zealand company and we also have strong principles in that none of our products have palm oil in them so it’s a combination of those things but it also goes back to the quality of the product chocolate is a small indulgence and customers don’t want to be disappointed most people are experts on chocolate as well they know what they like because they’re putting it into their mouthshello chocolate lovers these blocks are extra good they help communities improve healthcare in ghana you can be in to win some here httpwhittakersnzchocolate posted by whittakers chocolate lovers on tuesday  may  hw because people are so familiar with the products and because we’ve been around for  years now people have grown up with that nostalgic peanut slab it’s trustworthy reliable and fortunately we haven’t let our chocolate lovers down ever it also comes down to our values and how we communicate online we have very strong twoway dialogue with social media and the fact that we actually listen and respond to chocolate lovers goes a long way toward having that mosttrusted brand status on getting social media righthw it’s been a longterm strategy for us as part of our brand we got into social media quite a long time ago and we’ve always been very clear on our values we’ve taken the time to be very active and responsive we monitor the community very closely and reply it’s also a great way to share news and we’re always trying to innovate surprise and reward our loyal chocolate lovers it’s a great platform and we’re very fortunate to have a product that so many people have a very strong emotional connection to with traditional media you have oneway communication and by allowing our communities to participate and talk to each other as well has been very valuable on brand collaborationspp we realised that we’ve got a pretty strong property with the whittaker’s brand and chocolate is a small indulgence and there are other products that are also small indulgences that can link up to chocolate chocolate milk is obviously one of those and we also have an icecream collaboration with killinchy gold so it’s really part of the brand development in those other premium areas in terms of linking with those products where there’s a natural connection so if you take lewis road creamery it’s a premium new zealand brand and chocolate milk just seemed a natural collaboration on the movement against unhealthy food  hw i think that other products like fast food and soft drinks are products that people consume as part of their everyday diet when consumers start to replace water with soft drinks this is where the problem arises but with chocolate it’s something you have on the odd occasion as a treat there are times when a birthday cake is allowed or a glass of champagne it’s about a sense of occasion     on maintaining qualitypp we’re the only company in new zealand that does the whole manufacturing process from bean to bar importing the cocoa beans roasting them refining them and doing the whole nine yards until the final product we could import cocoa liquor but we don’t do that because we want to maintain the quality andrew and brian have built up a huge knowledge in terms of where to source the best ingredients from be it cocoa almonds or macadamiason shifting ad spend to digitalhw i just had a bit of look today and spoke to our media strategist going back five years the split was  that’s  percent in traditional media and ten percent in digital and now the split is  so  percent in traditional and  percent in digital and that shift toward digital is likely to continue  pp most of this digital spend goes toward facebook youtube and google but television is still very important for us the emotional values of a brand are important and i think tv is still very successful in communicating these to consumerson staying ahead pp this industry is very competitive but we have a clear strategy that has been very successful for us over the past ten years and that has seen our market share grow we will continue that but the competition isn’t going to go away that’s why we’re still completely focused on being the best and that’s what we work towards we have a relatively small group of very hardworking and smart people working towards that on working with agencieshw in terms of a small team of people we also have very strong relationships with our advertising media and sales agencies these are all longterm relationships that have contributed to the success  pp we currently use assignment group for our creative work mbm is our media agency and tell works on the digital side creatives howard greive john plimmer and chris bleakley have worked with the business since the mid s—at different agencies but the people are still the same this is also the case for matt bale who drives the media at mbm on building the brandpp in terms of the brand we’ve got significant plans to continue building the brand but anything we do will always be measured against whether it’s adding to the quality of the brand and the quality of the product that is always our focuson the pressure of innovatingpp i think pressure is a good thing it gets the adrenaline running and we’re lucky in that everyone that currently works on the whittaker’s brand really enjoys it i don’t think we would be successful if we didn’t enjoy what we do and we enjoy what we do and we will continue to do that hw fortunately in chocolatemaking it is very vast and there are many directions we could go in there are always new ideas coming to the table from marketing export the directors and so on everyone is always very forthcoming with new ideas so we’re stuck in terms of innovation it’s generally a question of how we’re going to do it that’s really exciting and it gets everyone working toward the goal  on whether there’ll be brand collaborations in pp the short answer is ‘yes’ and the next one is ‘i can’t tell you what they are’ … we do have something coming and when it’s released we’ll send you nz marketing samples of it … strangely enough we have the agency outside the meeting room at the moment and they’re going to present the next campaign for us hello chocolate lovers j h whittaker may well have jelly on the mind heres a tip…keep your eye on july posted by whittakers chocolate

left some big shoes to fill and we reckon the young kiwi chefs in this fun and quirky spot manage a pretty good job not only does it remind the audience what bargain box is all about the kids act as a genuine endorsement as theyre real bargain box fans sought through the companys facebook page those featured in the spot are young chefs who can now add brand ambassadors to their list of talentswhos it forseafood new zealandwhy we like it while many new zealand brands promote a commitment to the environment and sustainable practices this spot for seafood new zealand takes a different approach by introducing new zealand to those who help make that happen while the voice over tells the story of how seafood new zealand plans to ensure local waters are teeming with fish for generations to come and admits that it doesnt always get it right the faces of the men and women working the industry proves there are people willing to make it a reality the diversity of those included from young women to older men also shows its a commitment all of new zealand is standing behindwhos it for national partywhy we like it at a time when every word is being picked apart by a finetooth comb national has decided that singing is the best approach as the upbeat song plays a montage of shots presents the diversity of new zealanders which include fishermen rugby players businessmen families farmers and fruit pickers who are all united by the words lets get together now concluding with a round of applause it also shows the support the national party—or they could be cheering on bill english as he
