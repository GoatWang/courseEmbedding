taken over acquisition finance companies often need to use external finance to fund an acquisition this can be in the form of bank debt andor equity such as a share issue advisory board an advisory board is common among smaller companies it is less formal than the board of directors it usually consists of people chosen by the company founders whose experience knowledge and influence can benefit the growth and direction of the business the board will meet periodically but does not have any legal responsibilities in regard to the company alternative assets this term describes nontraditional asset classes they include private equity venture capital hedge funds and real estate alternative assets are generally more risky than traditional assets but they should in theory generate higher returns for investors angel investor see business angels asset anything owned by an individual a business or financial institution that has a present or future value ie can be turned into cash in accounting terms an asset is something of future economic benefit obtained as a result of previous transactions tangible assets can be land and buildings fixtures and fittings examples of intangible assets are goodwill patents and copyrights asset allocation the percentage breakdown of an investment portfolio this shows how the investment is divided among different asset classes these classes include shares bonds property cash and overseas investments institutions structure their allocation to balance risk and ensure they have a diversified portfolio the asset classes produce a range of returns  for example bonds provide a low but steady return equities a higher but riskier return cash has a guaranteed return effective asset allocation maximizes returns while covering liabilities b  balanced fund a fund that spreads its investments between various types of assets such as stocks and bonds investors can avoid excessive risk by balancing their investments in this manner but should expect only moderate returns benchmark this is a standard measure used to assess the performance of a company investors need to know whether or not a company is hitting certain benchmarks as this will determine the structure of the investment package for example a company that is slow to reach certain benchmarks may compensate investors by increasing their stock allocation bimbo buyin management buyout a bimbo enables a company to reshuffle its allocation of share capital to bring about a change in management internally a group of managers will acquire enough share capital to buy out the company from within an outside team of managers will simultaneously buy in to the company management both parties may require financial assistance from venture capitalists in order to achieve this end bond a type of iou issued by companies or institutions they generally have a fixed interest rate and maturity value so theyre very low risk  much less risky than buying equity  but their returns are accordingly low bridge loan a kind of shortterm financing that allows a company to continue running until it can arrange longerterm financing companies sometimes seek this because they run out of cash before they receive longterm funding sometimes they do so to strengthen their balance sheet in the run up to flotation burn rate the rate at which a startup uses its venture capital funding before it begins earning any revenue business angels individuals who provide seed or startup finance to entrepreneurs in return for equity angels usually contribute a lot more than pure cash  they often have industry knowledge and contacts that they can pass on to entrepreneurs angels sometimes have nonexecutive directorships in the companies they invest in buyout this is the purchase of a company or a controlling interest of a corporations shares this often happens when a companys existing managers wish to take control of the company see management buyout c  capital call see drawdown capital drawdown see drawdown capital commitment every investor in a private equity fund commits to investing a specified sum of money in the fund partnership over a specified period of time the fund records this as the limited partnerships capital commitment the sum of capital commitments is equal to the size of the fund limited partners and the general partner must make a capital commitment to participate in the fund capital distribution these are the returns that an investor in a private equity fund receives it is the income and capital realized from investments less expenses and liabilities once a limited partner has had their cost of investment returned further distributions are actual profit the partnership agreement determines the timing of distributions to the limited partner it will also determine how profits are divided among the limited partners and general partner capital gain when an asset is sold for more than the initial purchase cost the profit is known as the capital gain this is the opposite of capital loss which occurs when an asset is sold for less than the initial purchase price capital gain refers strictly to the gain achieved once an asset has been sol  an unrealized capital gain refers to an asset that could potentially produce a gain if it was sold an investor will not necessarily receive the full value of the capital gain  capital gains are often taxed the exact amount will depend on the specific tax regime capital under management this is the amount of capital that the fund has at its disposal and is managing for investment purposes captive firm  a private equity firm that is tied to a larger organisation typically a bank insurance company or corporate carried interest the share of profits that the fund manager is due once it has returned the cost of investment to investors carried interest is normally expressed as a percentage of the total profits of the fund the industry norm is  per cent the fund manager will normally therefore receive  per cent of the profits generated by the fund and distribute the remaining  per cent of the profits to investors catch up a clause that allows the general partner to take for a limited period of time a greater share of the carried interest than would normally be allowed this continues until the time when the carried interest allocation as agreed in the limited partnership has been reached this usually occurs when a fund has agreed a preferred return to investors  a fund may return the cost of investment plus some other profits to investors early clawback a clawback provision ensures that a general partner does not receive more than its agreed percentage of carried interest over the life of the fund so for example if a general partner receives  percent of the partnerships profits instead of the agreed  per cent limited partners can claw back the extra one per cent closing this term can be confusing if a fundraising firm announces it has reached first or second closing it doesnt mean that it is not seeking further investment when fund raising a firm will announce a first closing to release or drawdown the money raised so far so that it can start investing a fund may have many closings but the usual number is around three only when a firm announces a final closing is it no longer open to new investors coinvestment  although used loosely to describe any two parties that invest alongside each other in the same company this term has a special meaning when referring to limited partners in a fund if company buyback the process by which a company buys back the stake held by a financial investor such as a private equity firm this is one exit route for private equity funds corporate venturing this is the process by which large companies invest in smaller companies they usually do this for strategic reasons for example a large corporate such as nokia may invest in smaller technology companies that are developing new products that can be assimilated into the nokia product range a large pharmaceutical company might invest in rd centres on the basis that they get first refusal of research findings d  debt financing this is raising money for working capital or capital expenditure through some form of loan this could be by arranging a bank loan or by selling bonds bills or notes forms of debt to individuals or institutional investors in return for lending the money the individuals or institutions become creditors and receive a promise to repay principal plus interest on the debt distressed debt otherwise known as vulture capital this is a form of finance used to purchase the corporate bonds of companies that have either filed for bankruptcy or appear likely to do so private equity firms and other corporate financiers who buy distressed debt dont assetstrip and liquidate the companies they purchase instead they can make good returns by restoring them to health and then prosperity these buyers first become a major creditor of the target company this gives them leverage to play a prominent role in the reorganization or liquidation stage distribution see capital distribution distribution in speciedistribution in kind this can happen if an investment has resulted in an ipo a limited partner may receive its return in the form of stock or securities instead of cash this can be controversial the stock may not be liquid and limited partners can be left with shares that are worth a fraction of the amount they would have received in cash there can also be restrictions in the us about how soon a limited partner can sell the stock rule  this means that sometimes the share value has decreased by the time the limited partner is legally allowed to sell dividend cover a dividend is the amount of a companys profits paid to shareholders each year dividend cover is the calculation used to show how much of a companys aftertax profit is being used to finance the dividend the formula is dividend cover  earnings per sharedividend per share drawdown when a venture capital firm has decided where it would like to invest it will approach its own investors in order to draw down the money the money will already have been pledged to the fund but this is the actual act of transferring the money so that it reaches the investment target dry close dry closing a dry close is when a private equity firm raises money for a fund early on in the cycle but then agrees to not levy any management fees on the money raised from its limited partners until it actually begins investing the fund most private equity firms will start raising a new fund when their current fund is around 0 invested venture firms tend to raise new funds earlier than buyout firms because they usually need to invest in followon rounds for their portfolio firms due diligence investing successfully in private equity at a fund or company level involves thorough investigation as a longterm investment it is essential to review and analyse all aspects of the deal before signing capabilities of the management team performance record deal flow investment strategy and legals are examples of areas that are fully examined during the due diligence process e  earlystage finance this is the realm of the venture capital  as opposed to the private equity  firm a venture capitalist will normally invest in a company when it is in an early stage of development this means that the company has only recently been established or is still in the process of being established  it needs capital to develop and to become profitable earlystage finance is risky because its often unclear how the market will respond to a new companys concept however if the venture is successful the venture capitalists return is correspondingly high equity financing companies seeking to raise finance may use equity financing instead of or in addition to debt financing to raise equity finance a company creates new ordinary shares and sells them for cash the new share owners become partowners of the company and share in the risks and rewards of the companys business evergreen fund a fund in which the returns generated by its investments are automatically channeled back into the fund rather than being distributed back to investors the aim is to keep a continuous supply of capital available for further investments exit private equity professionals have their eye on the exit from the moment they first see a business plan an exit is the means by which a fund is able to realise its investment in a company  by an initial public offering a trade sale selling to another private equity firm or a company buyback if a fund manager cant see an obvious exit route in a potential investment then it wont touch it funds have the power to force an investee company to sell up so they can exit the investment and make their profit but venture capitalists claim this is rare  the exit is usually agreed with the companys management team f  first time fund this is the first fund a private equity firm ever raises  whether the firm is made up of managers who have never raised a fund before or as in many cases the firm is a spinoff where managers from different established funds have joined forces to create their own new firm in the first instance the managers do not have a track record so investing with them can be very risky in the second instance the managers will have track records from their previous firms but the investment is still risky because the individuals are unlikely to have worked together as a team before followon funding companies often require several rounds of funding if a private equity firm has invested in a particular company in the past and then provides additional funding at a later stage this is known as followon funding fund of funds a fund set up to distribute investments among a selection of private equity fund managers who in turn invest the capital directly fund of funds are specialist private equity investors and have existing relationships with firms they may be able to provide investors with a route to investing in particular funds that would otherwise be closed to them investing in fund of funds can also help spread the risk of investing in private equity because they invest the capital in a variety of funds fund raising the process by which a private equity firm solicits financial commitments from limited partners for a fund firms typically set a target when they begin raising the fund and ultimately announce that the fund has closed at suchandsuch amount this may mean that no additional capital will be accepted but sometimes the firms will have multiple interim closings each time they have hit particular targets first closings second closings etc and final closings the term cap is the maximum amount of capital a firm will accept in its fund g  gatekeeper specialist advisers who assist institutional investors in their private equity allocation decisions institutional investors with little experience of the asset class or those with limited resources often use them to help manage their private equity allocation gatekeepers usually offer tailored services according

return on behalf the investors  limited partners the gp usually invests the partnerships funds within three to five years and for the funds remaining life the gp attempts to achieve the highest possible return for each of the investments by exiting occasionally the limited partnership will have investments that run beyond the funds life in this case partnerships can be extended to ensure
