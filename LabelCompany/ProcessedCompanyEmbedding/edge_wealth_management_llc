grow our client assets by investing and allocating capital efficiently over full market cycles our principals at edge as a rule invest in the same strategies and themes as those of our clients price discovery is one of the central functions of ﬁnancial markets markets are not always efficient in assessing the fundamental value of a security’s future cash flows our team’s robust research process

market valuation if we can consistently spot these market errors we can establish an investing edge and our portfolios will generate superior total returns while our investment philosophy remains consistent its execution is flexible as the investment landscape changes thus we strategically allocate capital across asset classes and industries based on prevailing opportunities changes in asset
