cosmetics and skin revlon       home  stories  brands  timelines  booklets revlon continued to revlon post from its beginnings in  selling nail polish revlon would go on to become one of the largest cosmetics companies in the united states much of the credit for this success has been attributed to one of the company’s founders charles haskel revson charles haskel revson a lot has been written about charles revson much of it uncomplimentary whatever else he was—nasty crude lonely virile brilliant inarticulate insecure generous honest ruthless complicated—charles revson was a man of singleminded persistence and drive entirely dedicated to his business and a perfectionist tobias  p  complex shy private crude smart one could go on and on with adjectives describing revson all would fit at one time or another he was such a strange mix of persons and personalities that no generalization would have properly profiled abrams  p  tobias and others provide us with a potted history of revson’s early life they note that he was born in somerville massachusetts in  the son of jeanette weiss and samuel morris revson but grew up in manchester new hampshire as the middle child between two brothers the older joseph and the younger martin after graduating from manchester central high school in  he went to work in the garment district of new york as a salesman for the pickwick dress company where he worked his way up to becoming a piecegoods buyer in  he ran away to chicago with ida thompson to get married but soon returned to new york got divorced moved back in with his parents and started selling nail polish for the elka company newark new jersey in  or  after working at elka for a short time he resigned and established what would become revlon in march  with his older brother joseph revson and a business acquaintance charles lachman revlon nail enamel corporation the new company was going to be named revlac – an amalgamation of revson and lachman – but it did not sound right tobias  p  so an ‘l’ replaced the ‘s’ in revson and revlon started up at  west st street new york the company incorporated the following year as the revlon nail enamel corporation with charles revson as president joseph revson its treasurer and general manager and charles lachman its vicepresident and technical adviser the youngest revson brother martin revson would join the firm in  and become its marketing manager above  charles revson president charles lachman vicepresident martin revson vicepresident and joseph revson treasurer and general manager it is sometimes said that charles revson took a big risk leaving a paid job at elka in the middle of the depression to start out on his own but the risk may not have been as large as it first appeared from all reports elka was a very small firm and revson was probably getting most of his income from commissions so going out on his own and selling for himself was potentially a move up as it cut out the middleman the biggest risk revson faced in his new venture was a guaranteed supply of nail polish this explains why charles lachman was so important to the business and why was he given a halfshare of it lachman’s wife’s family owned the dresden chemical company they made nail polish – possibly even for elka – and lachman’s involvement was on the condition that dresden would supply revlon with nail polish on credit also nail polish may not have been having the same slump in sales that was being experienced by other products during the depression years of the s in a piece of selfpromotion the j walter thompson company – the advertising agent for cutex – noted that manicure sales had actually risen during the years  in the three depression years since  total dollar sales volume for cutex manicure products has been  greater than in the three preceding years — following a steady sales growth since  j walter thompson company advertisement  as a salesman revson’s main problem was how to outdo the competition the largest nail polish company of the time was northam warren who held the cutex brand but there were a myriad of others including blue bird peggy sage glazo la cross and chen yu revlon not only survived it prospered in its first ten months of business it did us in sales and this jumped to us in  reaching us million by  tedlow  this is not to say that the early years were easy and joseph revson can take much of the credit for guiding the early company financially through this time cream polish one reason often given for revlon’s success is that its nail polish was superior to other brands according to this story charles revson had realised the potential of the elka’s opaque nail polish and made it better by producing it in a wider range of shades elka’s product however was revolutionary it was opaque all the other nail polishes on the market were transparent charles saw the potential in this difference the others were made with dyes and were limited to three shades of red—light medium and dark revson felt that polish—“cream enamel” as it came to be called—made with pigment so that it would really cover the nails and made in a wide variety of shades could capture the market tobias  p  although overstated there is some truth to this story most nail polishes at that time in the united states were formulated to be transparent and used dyes rather than pigments as colourants in the early s the fashion trend was to only colour the nail across the centre of the nail plate leaving the moon and the free edge clear when applied with skill this look went well with transparent nail polishes cutex was still promoting this nail fashion as late as  even though it had introduced a cream polish in  by contrast opaque or cream nail polish – containing pigments including titanium dioxide – was applied over the whole nail it covered flaws in the nail plate and required less skill to apply what is not true is that transparent polish only came in a limited range of colours – peggy sage for example had  shades of nail polish in  that could be harmonised with clothing however the number of shades was not as important as the colours in the range the exuberant s had ended with nail polish being produced in a wide variety of colours – including blues and greens as well as metallic colours like gold silver and bronze – many of which were used to match brightly coloured clothing particularly eveningwear the depression years of the s would see nail fashions move to more subdued reds and smokeyreds and this was the colour range revlon was promoting back in  cream nail enamel was received by beauty salon and consumer alike with great enthusiasm for it gave the nails a covering that hid flaws as no product had ever done before and it gave revlon the “hook” by which they could enter the style business with a commodity with cream nail enamel a range of reds could be developed that would not only flatter the hands but would also harmonize with the clothes a woman wore crazy colors were soon dismissed as being unwearable and in bad taste colors such as chromeyellows weird blues and greens fantastic shades that were the first obvious ones to think of aside from reds however subtle smokey tones in the spectrum or red ranging from light to dark beautified a woman’s nails and hands and at the same time could be made to harmonize with her wardrobe rise of revlon  p  above  revlon nail enamel corporation showrooms at  west th street new york the colours that revlon sold were mostly the work of charles revson whatever else that might be said of him revson did have a good eye for colour at least as it applied to makeup and clothing furnishings and fixtures were another matter more importantly revson treated nail enamel colours like fashion items and like clothing fashions was soon bringing out new shades in spring and autumn all of revlon’s marketing efforts would then be put into promoting the new shades while older ones although still available were softpedalled revson’s commitment to this idea was such that in  he opened a style department at revlon – run by miss cherie shackleton – specifically to promote style and fashion in manicure items above assorted revlon nail polishes as well as colour revlon nail enamels may have been superior in other ways as the story below – repeated in books about diane vreeland – suggests mrs vreeland – later fashion editor of harper’s bazaar and subsequent editor of vogue – became close to a friend of flame’s ‘flame’ d’erlanger simply called perrera who dabble in investments but whose greatest love was giving manicures … perrera’s polish was made to a special formula which he alone knew drying almost instantly to a rockhard finish from time to time he would give some to friends and when mrs vreeland returned to new york in the late s she took two bottles with her the polish so impressed mrs vreeland’s manicurist that she offered to have a boyfriend take a look at it ‘i think i can get him to copy it’ said the manicurist ‘really’ replied la vreeland ‘who’s the boyfriend’ ‘charles revson’ came the reply the revlon range by this time had a great colour palette and a reputation for not chipping but as mrs vreeland recollected ‘it took hours to dry and had no staying power’ she remained convinced that ‘revson studied perrera’s formula and evolved a product that dried faster than anything anyone had ever used in america’ woodhead  pp  quality there are other reports that revlon had a quality product a c bailey of the bailey beauty supply company in chicago – who admittedly became a revlon distributer in  and may therefore be a little biased – is quoted as saying “i went with him” bailey says “because i had checked with some of the finest beauty shops in the east like michael of the waldorf and found the polish was incredible it was chipproof and had more stayon power had more gloss and lustre the colors were beautiful and the formula was just terrific we were carrying at the time about five brands of nail polish blue bird chenyu glazo and a couple of other we threw everything else out and carried only revlon” tobias  p  revlon products therefore appear to have been as good as if not better than its competitors in part this was due to revson’s obsession with quality quality concerns may have been the reason for revson switching his nail polish supplier from dresden to maas  walstein around  although a cynic might interpret this move as an example of revson’s aversion to being beholden to anyone andor part of the move that saw lachman’s share of the revlon business cut from onehalf to onethird tobias  p  sales force even if we accept that revlon’s nail enamel was good and its colours fashionable i do not think this completely explains the rise in the company’s fortunes in the s for that we need to look first at revlon’s sales force charles revson was a very successful salesman he was enthusiastic quite good looking when younger would endear himself to female buyers by arriving with his nails painted in the latest revlon shades and was apparently prepared to exchange sex for a revlon sale or extra revlon counter space when martin revson joined revlon in  as its sales manager he proved to be an even better salesman – presumably emulating his brother’s sales practices – and also put together an aggressive sales force for revlon revlon salesmen were expected to win if a chenyu nail enamel color chart somehow walked out of a store in a salesman’s briefcase … well it could always be replaced by a revlon color chart if the bottle caps on some chenyu nail enamel were loosened a bit and the enamel hardened … well the store or the customer would know not to buy an inferior brand again if in an attempt to secure counter space a salesman should spread his arms out accidentally sweeping the competitive product off either end of the counter onto the floor … well the salesmen were authorized to buy up the damaged merchandise at the retailer’s cost and replace it with revlon product tobias  p  in his endeavours to ‘bury the opposition’ revlon continued to use dubious sales practices leaving aside charges of wiretapping in the s – strongly suggested but unproven – the most important of these was coercion revlon was not above using a bit of ‘muscle’ in  for example a trade magazine reported that the los angeles company sealcote co had accused revlon of violating its tradename and pressuring dealers sealcote made the charge that not only was revlon’s sealfast an imitation of their product sealcote but that since revlon had introduced their product in  the company had been “coercing dealers jobbers and beauty parlours not to carry sealcote“ apeor  resulting in the cancellation of numerous sealcote orders this was not an isolated case and eventually the us federal trade commission ftc issued revlon with a series of cease and desist orders in  and  but by then it was too late after  demand for revlon products was such that that coercion was largely unnecessary revlon’s attempts to shut out competitors date back more than  years and it took the trade commission some time to get this giant specialist on women’s beauty to agree that it would quit using unfair trade practices on those beauty shops which dared sell a rival product here is some of the sworn testimony showing how revlon tried to dominate the lipstick market the royal supply co a houston texas beauty jobber wrote thomas products of buffalo a nail cream manufacturer l “please do not ship your order of  since we handle revlon they do not want us to handle competitive items” here is another letter from revlon to o l becker of the bg supply co albuquerque “it is understood that in consideration for granting you the distributorship for albuquerque you will of course carry revlon preparations only and accordingly promptly dispose of any stock you may have on hand of other preparations” again mortimer a fogel manager of quality cosmetics of new york testified  that the duchess beauty and barber supply of knoxville tenn had returned to him an entire year’s supply of “monique” beauty products excluding  gallons of shampoo after signing with revlon the chillicothe constitutiontribune missouri  feb  p  as it became a larger cosmetic company with a stronger department store presence revlon improved sales by placing demonstrators in select stores and made payments of ‘push money’ elsewhere by  the company had over  demonstrators employed in department stores throughout the country as well as promoting revlon products the demonstrators could give immediate feedback by telephone on how lines were moving television magazine  feedback that was added to field reports from regional managers salon and department store representatives revlon’s sales in the s were also boosted by the fact that its early business was salonoriented the popularity of the new permanent waves attracted a lot of customers to american beauty salons in the s and many women would also get a manicure when they came in to have their hair set it was a lot easier for a revlon salesman to get an order from a salon than to get an opening in a department store and a salon manicure allowed customers to try and then buy a revlon nail enamel salons that tried the product and liked it would reorder and their customers would spread the word and start asking for it from their local department store so the permanent wave boom was perfectly timed to help revlon to establish itself a major piece of luck for the new company salons revson was very aware of the importance of salons to his business although the company began selling to department stores after  they had a number of products that were clearly aimed at making salon manicures a total revlon experience by  as well as selling twentyone shades of cream nail enamel revlon had also developed a range of other nail cosmetics including adheron a base and top coat prolon  for weak brittle nails oily polish remover in liquid or pads cuticle lotion and nail cream along with other manicure equipment like emery boards and orange sticks then in  they added a range of hand lotions to enable manicurists to better personalise their revlon treatments special personalized manicures have been developed by revlon and outlined in a booklet “how to give … how to sell revlon manicures” just as the hair requires individual treatment in permanent waving so to do different hands revlon maintains and suggests four techniques a style manicure a lactol manicure for dry brittle hands a hand sculpture manicure with massage a hand sculpture manicure with arm massage each incorporates one or more of four new revlon products they are hand massage cream for lubrication a hand finishing lotion a hand cream of the pink pearly type and an emulsified pearl hand lotion these items in addition to some new steel implements and nail enamels are offered in a handsome chrome manicure tray apeor  above  revlon manicure tray containing massage cream hand creams nail enamels remover and manicure implements northam warren a major factor in the rise of revlon was the action of its biggest competitor northam warren the owners of cutex glazo and peggy sage that collectively controlled most of the nail polish business in the united states by the s however northam warren’s strength may have worked against it as revlon entered the retail market a number of forces were operating to make a new competitor and a change in status very welcome to a major part of the retail trade certain deep antagonisms existed in the mind of the retail trade and certain basic dissatisfactions with the policy of a predominant supplier throughout the retail trade there was an eager expectation for someone vigorous with a new idea that could be picked up accepted and promoted as a foil to this other company revlon stepped into this fortunate retail situation at the precise psychological moment with a new product and a new sales idea the result is history in this industry nail enamel  p  even if this ‘industry antagonism’ was not as severe as this author makes out it is clear that northam warren failed to fully capitalise on their introduction of cream nail polish and the harmonising of nail polish with lipstick see also nail polish and northam warren lipstick the idea of matching nail enamels with lipsticks was an old one dating from the late s cutex revlon’s biggest nail polish rival had already introduced a line of lipsticks to match its crème nail polish range which was first sold in  debuting in  cutex lipsticks came in automatic containers in four shades natural coral cardinal and ruby with advertisements that used headlines such as “fashion says—lips and fingertips now must match” five years later in  revlon introduced its own lipsticks in nine shades with colours that matched revlon nail enamels revlon salesgirls were supplied with charts which they could use to advise customers on which shade went with which and revlon supported sales with an advertising campaign that used coloured advertisements – a first for revlon – a number of which used the slogan ‘matching fingertips and lips’ a reversal of the tag used by cutex as it was no longer just in nails revlon changed its name to the revlon products corporation and followed up the introduction of lipstick with cheek stick  a cream rouge in stick form – it came with a small packet of tissues to help spread the rouge without staining the fingers – and a lipstick brush  copying what cutex did by matching lipstick with nail polish would not be the last time revson capitalised on an idea developed by others charles revson was not a creative product genius and a lot of what revlon produced was copied from competing cosmetic companies when others came up with a good product revson would have it analysed improve the formulation where possible and conduct an extensive advertising campaign to help sell it as mike sager a revlon salesman noted “copy everything and you can’t go wrong” he remembers charles telling him that way—and it was basically charles’s formula for fortythree years—you let the competitors do the groundwork and make the mistakes and when they hit with something good you make it better package it better advertise it better and bury them tobias  p  although this is an oversimplification – copying was endemic to the cosmetics industry as a whole – it contains more than a grain of truth there are more examples of revlon copying its rivals than the other way around he revson gave many hours of his time each week to the laboratory as he often told me “that’s where it starts” adding “if it’s wrong there kiddie forget it” he was not a chemist but learned quickly what the technological side of chemistry could do for his business he filled his laboratory with every conceivable electronic device capable of producing and measuring products he once said to me during a competitive discussion “anything they make we can break down in twenty four hours and copy” he did too abrams  pp  above charles revson in the revlon laboratory tuesday was lab day for many years tobias  wartime when the united states entered into the second world war in  revlon contributed to the war effort assembling firstaid kits making dye markers for the navy and manufacturing handgrenades for the army charles also lost martin revson for the duration of the war when his brother joined the navy the war also generated supply shortages in glass metal and assorted cosmetic ingredients and may have been the reason revlon rationalised its lines in  dropping seven shades of nail enamel along with matching lipsticks and suspending three shades of cheek stick however this still left seventeen shades of nail enamel remaining and the war shortages did not stop revlon from introducing new colours probably the most famous of these was mrs miniver rose packaged in a plastic case as metal was in short supply revlon produced the shade – without consulting mgm the makers of the wartime propaganda film ‘mrs miniver’ – released in june  starring greer garson and walter pidgeon revson must have been gratified to see print fabrics real and artificial roses and other fashion accessories on display in stores all over america soon after revlon released the shade despite the war shortages revlon also managed to introduce some new products including a brief foray into leg makeup with leg silk and more importantly the addition of face powder into its range with revlon windmilled face powder  in snow pink vanilla frost misty coral peach icing country cream mrs miniver rose rosy future and sun mocha shades  revlon windmilled face power nail polish and lipstick in matching russian sable shade my guess would be that the name was selected to mimic coty’s air spun face powder first put on the market in  revson admired coty it had class revson was particularly enamored of their advertising the coty girl wore huge widebrimmed hats which became a trademark of the firm revson then just commencing his own advertising program must have looked in awe at the size and splendor of his competitor for by then coty had widened its line into lipstick nail polish and other makeup lines abrams  p  revlon also made the winning bid of us for the german firm graef  schmidt inc new york which had been seized by the us government in  because of its german business ties revlon then exercised its option to buy graef  schmidt’s factory buildings and the company came out of the war able to make its own manicure and pedicure instruments removing the need to order them from an outside source postwar although revlon’s sales grew and its distribution network was extended scarce supplies meant that revlon’s growth was restricted during the war even so by  they had become the largest vendor of nail enamel and lipstick in the world apeor  as the postwar production ramped up revlon continued on much as before except that beginning in  they began to use fullcolor photographic advertisements to publicise their products in major magazines like ‘vogue’ and ‘harper’s bazaar’ with spreads running occasionally over two pages the postwar shade promotions included fatal apple  ultraviolet and bachelor’s carnation  cinderella’s pumpkin  orchids to you  plumb beautiful  sunny side up stormy pink where’s the fire and love that red  and certainly red  but by far the most successful was fire and ice the fire and ice shade promotion was launched in the autumn of  it was developed by kay daley – from the advertising agency norman craig  kummel – and bea castle – revlon’s inhouse marketing executive – and featured the model dorian leigh in a silver sequinned dress with red cape photographed by richard avedon ‘vogue’ magazine planned its november issue around the shade and the usual blanket of magazine ads window displays counter cards and radio endorsements helped by a good deal of free publicity pushed total revlon sales to almost us million  revlon fire and ice window display revlon also added some new products in the immediate postwar period including fashion plate  a pressed cream powder that promised a ‘porelessasporcelain’ finish but could be applied without water aquamarine lotion  a complexion lotion for the hands and body lipfashion lipstick  a long slim stick which had a double angled tip with a narrow side for outlining the lips and a broad side for filling them in touch  glow  a matt liquid makeup in seven shades and dreamy eye makeup  consisting of mascara eyeliner and eyeshadow above  revlon manicurist using a nail template to enamel her own nails when aquamarine lotion proved to be successful revlon built it into a complete line which included aquamarine soap aquamarine bath powder aquamarine cream deodorant and aquamarine spray deodorant  aquamarine cream deodorant and aquamarine lotion deodorant  aquamarine shaving balm aquamarine lotion for hands and legs and aquamarine lotion shampoo for dry normal oily and bleached hair  aquamarine talc and aquamarine spray deodorant  aquamarine splurge afterbath mist  and aquamarine after bath freshener and aquamarine milk bath  this practice of adding ‘flankers’ or ‘line extensions’ was repeated by revlon to build a number of products into extended lines including ultima moon drops natural wonder clear and clear and sun bath by  revlon was a large cosmetics company with manufacturing plants in most of north and south america in  countries in the near and middle east and subsidiary organisations in  european countries as well as britain iceland and malta apeor  overseas sales were handled by revlon international corporation in the united states the company’s products were distributed directly to  department stores  better drug stores and numerous high class beauty salons apeor  and revlon could be said to be on par with its competitors however apart from nail polishenamel revlon did not dominate any particular line of cosmetics and although it was a market leader in lipsticks this lead would be challenged in the s the lipstick wars in  hazel bishop began an extensive newspaper radio and television campaign promoting hazel bishop lasting lipstick beginning what has been referred to as the ‘lipstick wars’ by  hazel bishop had captured  of the american lipstick market and had also introduced a rouge and nail enamel into its cosmetics range see also hazel bishop and lipstick wars most of hazel bishops’s success was the result of its extensive use of television advertising a medium revson did not understand and disparaged mainly because it was broadcast in blackandwhite not colour just as color plays a major role in revlon products so it does in advertising each new color is promoted to the hilt magazine ads counter cards packages window displays and direct mail proclaim the new colors as they come along color is one reason that revlon has never gone heavily into radio or blackandwhite television but when color television is perfected you can bet your bottom dollar revlon will be in it apeor  p  the situation was made worse for revlon when coty added coty “” indelible lipstick to its range in  using the theme ‘wake up beautiful with “alive” color glowing on your lips’ it proved to be a big seller and affected revlon’s sales even further between hazel bishop and coty revlon’s share of the american lipstick market hit an all time low abrams  p  in  to combat hazel bishop revlon added indeliblecreme lipstick to its regular lipstick but was forced to abandoned it in  when the us federal trade commission ftc got agreement from advertisers that lipsticks can only claim to be ‘indelible’ ‘smearproof’ or ‘nonsmear’ if the word ‘type’ was used with such descriptions its replacement was lanolite lipstick a greasy lanolin enriched lipstick in nonsmear and regular formulations but sales were disappointing in  in response to coty “” revlon introduced living lipstick the twentyfour hour type with the line ‘put living color on your lips’ an obvious copy of coty’s ‘alive’ rather than face a protracted legal battle with revlon for copying coty simply informed international playtex – who had a trademark on ‘living’ for living bras that included toiletries – and revlon was forced to also cease production of this line under threat of a court action revlon’s lustrous lipstick – the fourth lipstick revlon had marketed since  – went on sale in  one year after revlon released the futurama refillable lipstick cases designed by the jewellers van cleef  arpels when futurama was first put on the market women could chose to insert either living lanolite or regular lipsticks  and then later lanolite lustrous or living lipsticks  this was too much the choice confused women and revlon got trade complaints about the need to stock three different types of lipstick in a wide range of colours and refills living lipstick was dropped because of the playtex legal suit and revlon dumped over  lanolite lipsticks off its inventory abrams  p  leaving only lustrous lipstick remaining above  revlon living lustrous and lanolite lipsticks fortunately for revlon it was now in a position to bear the cost of this by  it was the sole advertiser of the hottest television show in the america ‘the  question’ with it revlon won the lipstick wars and coty and hazel bishop were no longer considered a major threat ‘the  question’ revlon had previously sponsored a number of television shows including ‘revlon mirror theater’ ‘mr and mrs north’ ‘what’s going on’ and ‘whom do you trust’ none of which had proved to be successful in its battle with hazel bishop and their television program ‘this is your life’ revson had little choice but to try again and much against his better judgement he agreed to be come the sole sponsor of yet another television program ‘the  question’ the show first went to air on th june  and after a slow start proved to be a phenomenon almost anything revlon advertised on it got a massive sales boost the company’s sales jumped from us to us in  – even though the program had only been televised for six months – and had more than doubled to us by  the year the show went off the air abrams  p  see also revlon and ‘the  question’ by  revlon was the number one seller of lipstick hairspray nail products and makeup tobias  p  and way out in front of all of its competitors even outselling avon revlon had also gone public on december   six months after the debut of ‘the  question’ the shares began at us but hit us within a few weeks and were split twoforone in  helena rubinstein may have been a rival but even she had revlon shares however charles revson was soon on his own joseph revson left the firm in  and martin followed in  in both cases the departures were acrimonious other lines while engaged in the lipstick wars revlon was expanding its product range in a number of directions the company added to its makeup range with second nature  a liquid makeup base lovepat  a pressed powdercream and touch  glow face powder  it also developed a skincare range beginning with white sable liquid cleansing cream  followed by moon drops  a moisturising balm clean and clear  a foaming cleanser containing hexachlorophene build up  a firming facial waking beauty  a night cream containing vitamins a d and e liquid asset  a skin normaliser and ultima  a face cream above  some of revlon’s products produced in the year it became a public company and listed on the stock exchange included are lipsticks futurama lipstick cases nail enamels hair sprays touch and glow liquid makeup and face powder lovepat and fashion plate compacts aquamarine products buildup firming facial moon drops moisture balm waking beauty enriched night creme white sable cleansing creme and second nature estrogenic liquid makeup eyeshadow eyebrow pencil and mascara silicare clean and clear deep cleansing liquid cheekstick liquid and cake rouge manicuring equipment and assorted fragrances revson also began to show a greater interest in perfumes if he had not been previously convinced about the importance of fragrance the success of estée lauder’s youth dew bath oil  must have certainly attracted his attention in  making one of his infrequent public appearances as a speech maker he told the national association of chain store druggists “get a fragrance going and you’ve got everything soaps powders afterbath colognes bath beads — you name it” revson saw the line extension possibilities of fragrances as a money machine which could keep turning out product after product once the public accepted the basic essence he also believed fragrances were one of the few untouchable areas free of government fda and ftc regulation “y’know what they’d have to put on a fragrance label” he told me once “hopes and dreams — not ingredients kiddie — hopes and dreams” abrams  p  revson had already followed this idea by releasing the aquamarine line scent being made available as a spray mist in  the same year that he released fire and ice parfum in  revlon introduced intimate a perfume that imitated dior’s miss dior first sold back in  with some reluctance revson agreed to it being advertised on television – the first fragrance to be promoted this way – and within a year it was one of the six largest selling fragrances in the world again helped along by ‘the  question’ other products produced by revlon in the s included silicare  a hand protectant silicare medicated hand and body lotion  sun bath  a beauty tanning lotion top brass  a men’s hair dressing hi and dri  a roll on deodorant the antibiotic neomycin added in  living curl  a hair spray and thin down  tablets for weight reduction containing an appetite depressant and vitamins some of these came from revlon’s increasing interest in pharmaceuticals the company had been acquiring pharmaceutical firms and adding them to its pharmaceutical division instituted in  some of its pharmaceutical products were related to skincare but others like femicin a medication for period pain were drugs pure and simple prestige cosmetics by  – thanks largely to the success of ‘the  question’ – revlon had become one of the biggest cosmetic firms in the united states only avon had larger overall sales rather than being happy about this charles revson was worried revson knew that there was a difference between a commodity and a fashion item a commodity is used until it is finished and competitors usually compete on price a fashion item can be discarded long before the product is used up and competitors differentiate themselves through creativity and marketing skill with a product that is priced accordingly as they were primarily about colour revson could market nail enamels and lipsticks as fashion items with new colours appearing each spring and autumn they were advertised extensively and marketed through packaging displays and promotional tieins with fashion magazines and department stores which allowed revlon to set a premium price the publishers information bureau indicated that revlon spent us on magazine advertising in  a single advertisement in the new yorker us in  us in  after lipstick was added to the inventory and us in  apeor  revlon advertised heavily in relation to its sales – and in its early days borrowed heavily to fund it – which gave people the impression that the company was a lot bigger than it really was tobias  p  it also helped establish revlon as a producer of prestigious products in the minds of its customers a key to this strategy was maintaining a degree of exclusivity to preserve its prestigious image as a high fashion high margin brand revlon had to control distribution and keep its products out of stores that would cheapen the brand and lead to price competition for the most part revlon had managed to do this restricting its products to ‘selected’ stores and salons revlon entered the s as a relatively luxurious nail polish and lipstick brand but it ended the decade largely as a mass marketer this was mainly due to the success of its television advertising but it was also partly the result of the inclusion of new products that were more difficult to promote as fashion items revson was very aware of this problem and battled to try and maintain revlon or at least parts of the company as a highend brand the tv campaign had tripled revlon sales but it had also made it more mass than class just the opposite of what charles revson had planned he urged me to retain at least the combination of mass and class and we had been able to do that through a combination of restricted distribution luxury packaging and higher than average pricing still there was no denying that the one thing revlon was losing in the process of growth was “class” abrams  p  abrams suggests that there was more to revson’s obsession with class than simple economics revson argued that the quality image of his top lines would enhance the image of basic revlon but pride not profit was his fundamental motivation in taking the course he did abrams  p  revson’s concern about prestige was the main reason behind a number of developments including the princess marcella borghese line  – the first time revlon had used a ‘celebrity’ endorsement – the opening of ‘the house of revlon’ beauty salon in new york  and the introduction of the ultima ii line  princess marcella borghese after negotiations with princess marcella borghese  in italy princess marcella borghese inc was registered as an american corporation in  after which the princess travelled to the united states to help develop the line things did not go smoothly expected personal formulas for cosmetics proved to be nonexistent abrams  p  and after the line was released in  fabergé took revlon to court charging that the borghese packaging and promotion copied their julliette marglen line these problems may have turned revson against it and be part of the reason why princess marcella

salonsthe company grew even during the depression because of mr revsons decision to concentrate his sales efforts on beauty salons which were then in the midst of the permanentwave boom even after revlon began to sell through department and drug stores in  the salon business remained its major preoccupation for some years by  revlon had a near monopoly in the estimated total of  beauty salons throughout the country selling in bulk to the professional operators and to the women who bought their cosmetics at the salons the dominance built up during that period exists to this daymr revson was generally recognized as the moving force of the company and the visionary both in new‐product development in his younger days he often walked‐around with nails dabbed with polish and hands striped with lipstick and in the advertising that pushed revlon to national prominencerevlon introduced the concept of “matching lips and fingertips” in —earlier colors of lipstick and nail polish had not been thus coordinated and there were only a few shades generally light medium and dark in each this was followed by magazine advertising that promoted revlons varied glamorous colors and romantic names it was consistently brilliant and considered the best in the industry in  the “fire and ice” advertisement was introduced it is still considered one of the classics of the beauty businessdespite the extraordinary magazine impact most of it sparked by mr revsons demand for nothing less than perfection revlons television efforts were until  mediocre in that year revlon began sponsorship of “the  question” with a clause unusual at the time that gave it the right to abandon the program after  weeks should it prove a dud after its first showing mr revson was unconvinced about its drawing power“its a turkey” he told colleagues who gathered after the showswamped with demandnevertheless from the day the program went on the air the company was swamped with dealer demand sales rose  per cent earnings went up almost  per cent and even the resultant quiz‐show scandals could not diminish the impact revlon shares which had just been offered to the public at  a share rose to  in three monthsin the ensuing years new products and use of advertising continued their parallel courses in pushing revlon to the top of the industry cosmetics skin care products shampoos and hair sprays fragrances and mens products in a wide range prices spewed forth from the fertile minds of company and advertising executives from revlons product‐development laboratory and from acquisitions the trade names marketed by revlon included ultima ii princess marcella borghese moon drops intimate fianima replique miss balmain etherea bill blass braggi and royal pub the advertising budget ‐million

on charges of fraud misrepresentation and breach of agreement in a stock deal the suit was settled out of court but the brothers remained estranged until after josephs death in  martin revson is now head of dell laboratories manufacturer of inexpensive cosmetics advertisement continue reading the main story decision to diversifyone of charles revsons most orilliant business moves was his decision in  to diversify his cosmetics empire by nibbling off a tiny piece of the hugely profitable pharmaceutical industry against the advice of most of his associates he paid ‐million for the united states vitamin and pharmaceutical corporation a sleepy drug company with modest sales of ‐million a yearas he had with revlon mr revson soon began adding products to the usv line cross‐licensing agreements with foreign companies brought with them the right to market new drugs in this country and elsewhere and a  exchange lagreement with the ciba‐geigy corporbtion gave usv certain marketing rights patents and trademarks for four widely used drugs and marketing rights to  additional drugs revlon expanded into  new and different therapeutic categories and in return ciba‐geigy received ‐million in cash and the rights to market an oral diabetic drugless than a decade after he had entered the pharmaceutical industry  per cent of the sales of revlon inc and  per cent of its profits derived from sales of health products in the united states and  other countriesby  the revlon product range had grown to more than  individual items sold in  countries the companys sales totaled ‐million and net earnings were ‐millionmr revsons business judgment was not however infallible involvements with businesses as diverse as plastic flowers and loungewear made in hong kong and sportswear made in the united states were terminated in a comparatively short time the companys fouryear ownership of evan‐picone the sportswear house resulted in a loss of ‐million when it was sold in interest in clothesalthough his professional ventures into the fashion industry were peripheral and shortlived mr revsons personal interest in the clothes worn by his third wife the former lyn fisher sheresky their ‐year marriage ended in divorce in  resulted in one of his most astute business tie‐upsat one time the late designer norman norell would send his collection to the revlon office where mr revson selected styles for his wife liter mr revson began to accompany his wife to fashionable showroom openingshe thought so highly of the designers talents that he made a business arrangement with him under which the norell name went on revlons most prestigious perfume it was fortuitous timing the venture came just as a fragrance boom was beginning and the new scent norell became what many considered the first great american perfume mr revson aware of the fragrance trend soon followed norell with charlie a less expensive scent aimed at a younger market advertisement continue reading the main story although revlon was built on its sales to women mr revson employed few of them in key positions“i dont think he trusted womens thinking to any degree” commented one who knew him well and who remembered his comment that “a man gets his strength from a woman and then he goes on from there”opposite ends of roomhowever because of the nature of the cosmetics business women were the objects of his principal business vendettas he was loath to mention the name of his competitors and it was known as the height of folly to invite the revlon founder and estee lauder a chief rival in the field to the same party when the two did find themselves in the same room they pretended they werent and proceeded with entourages to opposite endsmr revson had the last word in earlier business feuds although he did not retaliate publicly while they were going on the late elizabeth arden called him “that man” and he so named one of his mens fragrances the late helena rubinstein referred to him as “the nail man” after her death he bought her park avenue triplex he also made certain that he surmounted other cosmetics companies in the general motors building home of revlons corporate headquarters estée lauders offices are on the th floor and helena rubinsteins until a recent move were the d revlon is at the topthe prestige built up by estée lauder and the fact that mr revson and mrs lauder both moved with international society perhaps accounted for mr revsons increasing preoccupation with building up his own name in his later years“charles revson” began to be used in advertising copy and news releases went out on paper emblazoned with inch‐high gold letters outlining the name and although he was known as charles to his friends he was not averse to the marketing of the name charliekept eye on detailsdespite his interest in the social whirl and the amount of time he spent aboard the ultima h the ‐foot ‐ton yacht he bought from daniel k ludwig multimillionaire shipbuilder mr revson never lost contact with his office he was aware of the smallest details within the organization and was never hesitant in voicing opinion or criticism“he chewed up executives the way some people chew vitamins” said one chewed‐up executive who noted that even the hefty financial rewards offered by the company were nut sufficient to prevent a considerable turnover in upper‐echelon personnel and in advertising agencies at one time the corporate headquarters was dubbed “one big revolving door”at meetings mr revson had a reputation for lowering the heavy lids over his sharp blue eyes and assuming a sleepy look the knowledgeable were aware that the pose did not affect his vision he pounced when it was least expected and conferences would go on long after everyone else was weary advertisement continue reading the main story his employes were rarely told that they did a good job an omission many found frustrating others were irked at the atmosphere engendered by his personal likes and dislikes office romances were frowned on women in pants were merely tolerated and beards and brown shoes on male employes were restricted “not by dictum but by tone”enjoyed his successmr revson fully enjoyed the accouterments of success—the yacht the triplex a country estate in westchester a chauffeur‐driven rolls‐royce and the tailors and barbers who came to him he enjoyed too helping friends in distressas a man who never went to college he took a particular satisfaction in seeing his name on medical centers and fellowships the charles revson diagnostic center at the albert einstein college of medicine the charles revson institute of ophthalmology at new york medical center graduate fellowships at brandeis university revson plaza at columbia university he also contributed important sums of money to the salk institute and various charitiesalthough there had been some speculation about mr revsons unwillingness to groom a successor the guessing was brought to
