operating officer – chief executive officer – chairman address state farm insurance companies state farm plaza bloomington illinois  httpwwwstatefarmcom ■ like his grandfather and father before him edward b rust jr became the chairman and chief executive officer of state farm insurance companies having been associated with the company his entire life rust was well steeped in the mutual insurers corporate culture which placed a great deal of emphasis on serving policyholders who were the legal owners of the company and avoiding spending money unnecessarily however despite a lifelong association with state farm rust maintained that growing up in the midwest and learning rural values provided a moral foundation that would become more important to his achieving success as a chief executive one of those values was respect for education rust who held advanced degrees in business administration and law became devoted to the advancement of education in america and instrumental in state farms contributions in this area in terms of both money and the time of its employees rust served as a trustee of his alma mater illinois wesleyan university and was a member of the business advisory council of the university of illinois college of commerce and business administration as well as a member of the advisory council of the stanford university graduate school of business in addition he was the cochairman of the business coalition for excellence in education and was a member of president george w bushs transition advisory team on education deep family ties to state farm when rust was born in  in chicago his family was already deeply involved in the affairs of state farm the company was founded in  by george j mecherle of bloomington illinois his idea was to form a mutual insurance company for rural and smalltown drivers who paid higher premiums than urban drivers despite having fewer accidents by linking insurance rates to risk levels mecherle was able to offer much lower premiums than his competitors he also signed agreements with the state farm bureaus which received a fee for each of their members who purchased policies—hence the state farm name state farm soon covered city drivers as well and in  added life insurance by  state farm was the largest auto insurer in the country rusts grandfather adlai h rust was a young lawyer when he helped mecherle found state farm and became his righthand man mecherles son raymond took over the presidency of the company in  and when raymond died in  adlai rust took over as chief executive officer his son edward b rust sr joined state farm in  succeeded him as ceo in  and was named chairman in  according to edward rust jr his goal while growing up was not one day to work for state farm rather he focused on his education which was a point of emphasis in his family his father graduated cum laude from stanford university majoring in economics and was elected to phi beta kappa his mother harriett fuller rust graduated with honors from the university of southern california rust received his undergraduate degree in  from illinois wesleyan university in bloomington where he was a twoyear starting guard in football and became an accomplished wrestler he then went on to southern methodist university in dallas texas earning a master of business administration and a law degree rust told bests review in a december  article that going to work at state farm was not on his mind while completing his education it was not until i got out of law school and frankly had a couple good offers from law firms that i decided to give state farm a try rust stayed in dallas and in  became a state farm management trainee at the local office after gaining an overview of how regional operations were handled he returned home to bloomington to become an attorney in the state farm corporate law department he next became involved in marketing and sales before finally moving into general management in  he made vice president and in  was appointed executive vice president and chief operating officer and named a director rust maintained that being the bosss son was no guaranteed ticket to success  bests review  december  in fact being the subject of expectations from older generations was often a difficult burden to bear he was also quick to note that he owed a debt to a number of mentors beyond his father and grandfather rust sr dies in office in august  rusts father died at the age of  and his namesake only  years old was promptly appointed the new chief executive officer according to a fortune profile of state farm insiders at the company almost took the younger rusts promotion for granted however outside directors mostly academics and economists gave some thought to conducting a national search to bring in someone with a prestigious background these directors knew ed sr as very private disciplined and brilliant they knew the son as more outgoing but unproved as a businessman april   the idea of looking elsewhere was quickly dismissed however and rust was named to the post he soon proved that despite his age he was up to the job and two years later in  was named chairman of the board after nearly a decade heading state farm rust outlined to fortune what made a top executive observations that were a reflection of his own management style and core values he said you have to live and breathe the business always exploring new horizons and learning to understand the ever changing world around us april   at the same time rust emphasized the need to surround oneself with capable people and to have the confidence to delegate authority to them he also expressed the importance of striking a balance between a personal and work life as for his role at state farm rust narrowed it down to two areas the first is the development of people and the second is an untiring effort to better understand the marketplace how customer demands are changing  bests review  december  with rusts family fortunes so intertwined with state farms history it was difficult clearly to distinguish the corporate culture from the ceos personal worldview the insurer remained conservative in its approach to business essentially content to continue selling reasonably priced auto and home insurance in the words of one industry analyst quoted in a  businessweek article they dont throw the long bomb they just move the ball ahead slowly and steadily father knew best—and so did grandfather november   the company was so committed to controlling costs in the name of its policyholders that its corporate culture appeared to take on the zeal of religion and to many it went too far in  state farm was accused in a policyholder lawsuit of being too conservative in maintaining reserves with the effect of trimming dividend payments to policyholders legal problems trouble state farm during the s rust would face a number of legal problems that critics said were an outgrowth of state farms inbred culture and obsession with cost controls a  earthquake in the los angeles area led to lawsuits by homeowners who charged that the company had secretly reduced their earthquake coverage the matter was settled in  when state farm agreed to make  million in payments in  state farm was rocked by a string of blistering punitive damage decisions as reported by businessweek state farm whats happening to the good neighbor november   as the article noted in utah the company was fined  million in punitive damages in part for the systematic destruction of documents and systematic manipulation of individual claim files to conceal claim mishandling an idaho appeals court then fined the company  million in punitive damages for making use of a completely bogus outside billreview company that helped lower the cost of medical claims in october  an illinois jury rendered a  million judgment against state farm that amount was then stiffened by an additional  million in punitive and other damages awarded by the judge for the insurers breach of contract with auto policyholders by relying on generic replacement parts although the case revealed a number of damning internal documents rust was adamant in his insistence that state farm had not committed fraud a trained lawyer rust made his opinion of the current state of the court system a matter of public record in  he spoke before the appellate lawyers association outlining his belief that the civil justice system had undergone a fundamental shift in the years following world war ii it has gone from a faultbased to a pseudocompensationbased system  vital speeches of the day  september   in his opinion this change was in many ways a reflection of peoples decreased willingness to accept responsibility for their actions moreover lawsuits were becoming viewed a bit like a lottery with a large number of people looking to turn misfortune into a jackpot at a lower level people were more willing than ever to pad insurance claims but even this activity he said was fraud it was not the insurance company that would foot the bill of course the policyholder would pay because in the end it was the policyholders money that was at stake in the corporate culture of state farm with which rust so identified protecting the interests of the policyholder was sacrosanct a commitment to education while conservative business practices and a devotion to keeping a tight rein on policyholders money were core values that rust had essentially inherited from his forebears at state farm his devotion to advancing education was very much his contribution to the companys culture starting in  state farm offered its more than  employees one paid day off each year to offer help at a school whether that help involve accompanying a class on a field trip or providing expert advice to school administrators in  state farm became involved with the national board for professional teaching standards a teacherfounded organization that sought to improve the quality of teaching and to provide certification moreover state farm provided funds for new buildings fellowships and other programs at colleges and universities across the country as well as support for the beyond the books educational foundation which provided grants to elementary and secondary teachers for special projects that could not be funded at the local level rusts personal commitment to education was also evident in his willingness to serve as a trustee and adviser to illinois wesleyan university the university of illinois and stanford university as well as serving as the cochairman of the business coalition for excellence in education and on president bushs transition team covering educational issues with the start of the st century rust faced a number of challenges in leading state farm into the future the insurance industry was adversely impacted by a string of events asbestos claims the sudden drop in the stock market enron and other corporate scandals and the uncertainty that resulted from the terrorist attacks of september   while some were shortterm problems others carried longterm implications for the insurance industry how rust would be able to guide state farm through this period of great uncertainty remained to be seen sources for further information france mike father knew best—and so did

facebook   ？ facebook ？sams letter to ed rust jr ceo of state farm insurance re state farm counsel roland spies participation on alec i sent the following letter off to ed rust jr ceo of state farm today cced to roland spies and emailed to the state farm wisconsin media contact ann avery  its selfexplanatory april   mr edward b rust jr ceostate farm insurance state farm plazabloomington il  dear mr rust  i along with my family am a longtime state farm customer  my parents lowell and mabelhokin were state farm customers from before i was born in  and ive been a state farmcustomer since i bought my first car a used  volkswagen in   i always recommend statefarm to friends  i like the mutual insurance business model and i like the agents  ive always feltthat more than any other insurance company state farm is primarily concerned with its customersrather than corporate profits  after all we customers are shareholders and we benefit in part fromthose profits as well however something has recently come to my attention that has drawn my patronage of state farminto question  namely the rightwing legislative group american legislative exchange councilalec which consists of state legislators and privatesector executives has on its privateenterprise board a state farm executive mr roland spies who works as counsel in thebloomington office  in fact if you google roland spies state farm you will find a plethora ofsearch results pointing to pages in which mr spies participation on the alec private enterpriseboard is noted as im sure you know many wisconsin citizens like me are fighting a political battle against theantiworker and antifamily agenda of governor scott walker and his republican senate andassembly cohorts  recently a university of wisconsin historian prof william cronon publishedresearch revealing that several of the legislative bills introduced by wisonsin republican legislatorswere actually drafted by alec  in response the wisconsin republican party launched an attack onprof cronon using open records law to attempt to retreive all of his uw emails  needless to saythis has greatly raised public awareness of alec its association with wisconsin republicans andstate farms association with alec through mr spies membership on the alec privateenterprise board as the founder of the facebook page boycott scott walker contributors which is over strong as of today i am now being asked regularly whether a national boycott of state farm shouldbe advocated due to mr spies participation on alec and its implied association of state farmwith rightwing legislation  up to now ive said i need to see what the state farm ceo ed rusthas to say about this  so that is the purpose of this letter  there are  people in wisconsinplus other states waiting to hear from me on this issue  ive promised to contact you and ivepromised to make a state farm boycott recommendation based on your response as a longtime state farm member not as the founder of the facebook page i demand that statefarm ask mr spies to either resign from alec or clearly disassociate himself from state farm inhis alec activities  i demand that state farm no longer appear on alecs private enterpriseboard page  alec is an antilabor antifamily antiteacher and frankly antidemocraticorganization that is bent on destroying the way of life that state farm members and i think statefarm executive leadership hold dear  mr spies is of course free to join any rightwing group thathe likes but he should do so strictly as a private citizen and not as a representative of state farmif he remains on the alec private enterprise board he must insist that they remove his associationwith state farm from the listing and rather list him simply as a private citizen i look forward to hearing an official public announcement from you on this  many many otherstate farm members here in wisconsin await it  i hope to hear from you within two weeks  byapril   you may choose to not make a public statement and simply reply to me and i will makeyour reply public just as i am making this letter to you public by publishing it on my facebookpage absent a clear dissociation of state farm from alec we will be forced to take our businesselsewhere in a wellpublicized boycott and we will urge all state farm members throughout thecountry to take their business elsewhere as well  we will not support a company that evenindirectly lends legitimacy to an abhorrent organization like alec  alec is waging war on everyideal that state farm members hold dear and there simply cannot be any connection between statefarm and alec thank you very much for considering this carefully and considering the positive impact of taking astand against mr spies participation on the alec private enterprise board of directors in his roleas a state farm executive  state farm members will applaud you for standing up for their interestsrather than the interests of corporations and their owners sincerely samuel hokinmadison wi founder facebook page boycott scott walker contributors cc mr roland spies state farm counselcc ms ann avery state farm wisconsin media contact via emailboycott
