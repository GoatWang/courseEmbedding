directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not

published by booz  company global perspective linda rottenberg’s highimpact endeavor this social entrepreneur pioneered a new model for mentoring startups in emerging markets now she’s replicating it around the worldby paula margulies             pdf     growing up in one of rio de janeiro’s impoverished favelas heloísa helena assis realized that there was enormous demand for an affordable product that would tame brazilian women’s unruly curls in  assis and her partners — a former nanny a cabdriver and a mcdonald’s employee — started a business called beleza natural “natural beauty” in the basement of a modest house in the suburbs of rio de janeiro the company was an immediate success beleza natural was soon scrambling to keep up with demand unsure of how to pursue strategic growth with limited funding linda rottenberg in new york  photograph by peter gregoire in  assis turned to endeavor global inc a nonprofit organization headquartered in new york that promotes “highimpact entrepreneurship” in emerging markets endeavor accepted assis into its entrepreneurs program providing her with what endeavor founder and ceo linda rottenberg describes as “venture capital without the capital” — training mentoring and support from a network of business leaders finance and organizational experts and successful entrepreneurs with endeavor’s help beleza natural’s revenues have grown by  percent and its employment has increased by  percent since it joined the entrepreneur program in  today the company boasts  salons across brazil a full line of haircare products and a cosmetics research lab with us million in yearly revenue and  employees the company is a ragstoriches brazilian success story and it is the sort of story that endeavor has been helping to replicate in emerging markets across the globe over the past  years in  alone the organization’s entrepreneurs — who have created  jobs in  countries — generated  billion in revenue and  million in equity capital and whereas less than half of new firms in the us survive their first four years of operations  percent of endeavor’s emergingmarket companies still operate after eight years indeed pulitzer prize–winning author thomas friedman has called endeavor “the best antipoverty program of all” an oliveskinned brunette with a wide smile a pilatestoned physique and an intense gaze rottenberg  has a personality as vibrant as the colorful indian pillows in her office at endeavor’s global headquarters in downtown new york city on a busy day in march  she leans back in her chair and stretches her legs out on her desk the scuffed heels of her black boots visible to anyone walking by rottenberg is one of the world’s leading figures in social entrepreneurship — a field that she helped create her unswerving belief in the power of this field to effect profound change is the driving force behind endeavor whose unique social entrepreneurship model falls somewhere between capitalism and philanthropy the organization’s mission she says is to “meritocracize wealth” in emerging markets where entrepreneurs face daunting obstacles that include a lack of capital a dearth of role models and cultures that discourage risk by providing entrepreneurs in these countries with access to the networks and support necessary to scale their businesses she argues endeavor enables them to produce a highimpact ripple effect that can generate sustainable wealth and innovation “endeavor doesn’t create entrepreneurship” she says “it already exists in every country we just catalyze the conditions under which it can thrive” in the years since endeavor’s founding rottenberg has seen the idea of social entrepreneurship enter the mainstream she believes that by bridging the gaps between the private public and nonprofit sectors social entrepreneurship models like endeavor’s are uniquely poised to tackle society’s most pressing challenges the success of these models in aligning stakeholders’ values she says even in the face of difficult barriers offers valuable lessons for both government and the private sector pioneering social entrepreneurship rottenberg grew up in the leafy boston suburb of newton mass the daughter of a lawyer and a homemaker her family was supportive and stable — she credits them with giving her “the confidence to be curious” — but rottenberg realized early on that she itched for a lessconventional kind of life she also developed a passion for social activism “i was one of those crazy people who felt entrepreneurial but with a social bent” she says “i never started the proverbial lemonade stand but i started causerelated organizations” at  she headed a few miles down the charles river to harvard where she surrounded herself with expatriates and declared a concentration in social studies a field she says taught her “to care about the world and think holistically about problems” it was there that she discovered the work of joseph schumpeter the austrian economist who argued that a nation’s “fiery spirits” or entrepreneurs are its most powerful economic change agents responsible for the “creative destruction” that generates longterm sustainable growth rottenberg was riveted she began to believe that she could be part of a “generation of innovation” finding creative solutions to problems on both a local and a global scale as the head of the illfated harvard students for dukakisbentsen organization she carried campaign signs and hosted debatewatching parties she also became harvard’s first campus recruiter for the nonprofit teach for america which trains college students to teach in lowincome communities across the united states teach for america founder and ceo wendy kopp remembers rottenberg — whom she today hails as a “role model in international social entrepreneurship” — as “a leader who inspired top students to channel their energy in this direction before anyone had ever heard of teach for america” as graduation approached rottenberg wondered how she could leverage her desire for creative destruction into a career viewing nonprofits as maddeningly inefficient and slow she decided to go to law school where she could study the legal framework for policy “in retrospect today i probably would have gone to business school” she says “at the time though there wasn’t much on entrepreneurship — it was the late s and it was wall street or bust” instead she headed to yale law school which had a reputation as an incubator of policy thinkers and leaders yet once she was there rottenberg who had always thought of herself as someone who was “excited by everything” felt uninspired she concluded that she didn’t belong in law or in corporate america like many people in their s she was searching for direction and meaning eventually she found that direction in one of her childhood passions from an early age rottenberg had been captivated by latin america “my earliest pen pal was uruguayan” she recalls with a smile “and everyone always thought i was latina then i spent time in chile argentina and brazil and i just fell in love” so after graduating from yale law in  rottenberg accepted a job managing the yale–usaid interdisciplinary law program at argentina’s universidad de palermo although the work was interesting she yearned for something more entrepreneurial rottenberg found an outlet for her ideas in  when she discovered ashoka a nonprofit organization that was pioneering a microfinance model in brazil and mexico by leveraging the power of entrepreneurship to create a shift in the status quo ashoka pioneered the kind of approach that rottenberg would eventually adopt with endeavor the organization made grants of  or  to poor people who could use the money to buy a sewing machine or a calf and begin selling dresses or cheese the proceeds from those sales may not have been huge but they provided such basics as food clothing shelter and medicine for the sellers — and slowly helped to lift communities out of poverty liking what she saw rottenberg began working to expand ashoka’s reach in latin america bill drayton ashoka’s founder and ceo remembers her as “one of the world’s truly original people — passionate and practical focused on the globe and individuals engaged in business and society” rottenberg realized that she’d found her niche “i loved the fact that this field was raw territory at the time no one knew what this was so there was something about feeling part of a new movement that was very exciting for me” she recalls indeed although social entrepreneurship was first used in the academic literature on social change in the s and s the term was not yet in widespread use by the s that had begun to change as an increasingly interconnected world facilitated the spread of ideas organizations like ashoka were better able to gain a foothold share best practices and demonstrate the benefits of their models — and they did so at an opportune time the gulf between the world’s rich and poor was rapidly expanding there was a growing sense that neither government nor the private sector could solve all of the world’s problems “many services and sectors lay beyond companies’ visible selfinterest harnessing markets to serve the world’s poor or even to help grow a global middle class simply did not factor into the bottom line” rottenberg told harvard’s  social enterprise conference “social entrepreneurs rose up and attempted to bridge these gaps…we calibrated and navigated a new balance between government and the private sector” and although they often operated as nonprofits social entrepreneurs saw themselves as distinct from traditional nonprofits “social entrepreneurs are problem solvers not idealists we’re driven by innovation not by charity and we don’t believe in handouts we use entrepreneurial strategies to achieve social change” rottenberg has said gamechanging wealth creation eager to gain insight into latin america’s economic and social complexities rottenberg struck up conversations everywhere she went one day a taxi driver in buenos aires told her he had a phd in engineering “what are you doing driving a cab” she asked he looked at her blankly in the rearview mirror there were no jobs he said no opportunity his phd was as useful as a flat tire “so why don’t you become an entrepreneur” rottenberg asked “what’s an entrepreneur” he responded rottenberg was dismayed to learn that the words for entrepreneur and entrepreneurship were literally missing from the spanish and portuguese lexicon “there was no sense of the possible” she recalls “there was all this talent but there were no role models no venture capital no networks” what’s more the business culture stigmatized risk and failure linda rottenberg at the  london international selection panel photograph by dan massie courtesy of endeavor rottenberg also came to realize that there was a yawning gap between the privatesector equity that bankers were funneling to a small group of the country’s elite and the kind of financing she was promoting at ashoka for the poorest of the poor “microfinance and microcredit were doing great work in terms of poverty mitigation but they weren’t really producing the kind of gamechanging wealth creation that was necessary to build a middle class” she says someone she believed needed to meritocracize wealth and make it possible for people with profitable scalable business ideas to develop those ideas — even if they hadn’t been born into their country’s elite the model for filling this gap in wealth creation took shape in early  when ashoka sent rottenberg to harvard on an mba recruiting mission while there she ran into yale classmate peter kellner an investor in eastern europe’s emerging markets over coffee in harvard’s sleek shad hall rottenberg and kellner discussed their shared belief that emerging markets were untapped sources of innovation and that entrepreneurship was a powerful catalyst for wealth creation as they talked rottenberg grabbed a napkin and began scribbling notes essentially rottenberg and kellner saw themselves as venture capitalists they intended to scour latin america for earlystage highpotential entrepreneurs who could generate impressive returns and create jobs they agreed that the key to unleashing latin america’s entrepreneurial strength was to create silicon valleys of sorts on local soil yet they were well aware that the financial and cultural structures that had been in place in the original silicon valley were largely nonexistent in latin america years of corruption in latin america’s emerging markets had led to rampant bribery falsified financial statements and other dirty dealings resulting in a general mistrust of business surmounting these barriers would require both guaranteeing local ownership and fostering trust entrepreneurs needed to tap into local networks experience and wealth — which would be virtually impossible without the imprimatur of their country’s business leaders yet these leaders had little reason to trust a group of young upstarts with creative destruction in mind endeavor could succeed rottenberg believed only as a neutral third party — a nonprofit “we believed that neutrality would give us a competitive edge since there was so little trust on the ground” she says “if we were investors we’d lose that neutrality and jeopardize that trust” rottenberg coined the phrase highimpact entrepreneurship to signal the type of growthoriented scalable enterprises she hoped endeavor would enable “one of my pet peeves is that the nonprofit world does not do very good marketing” she says “look at the word nonprofit itself — it’s very negative highimpact entrepreneurship sounded big bold and aspirational” semantics aside rottenberg resolved that endeavor would be a new kind of nonprofit using the energy and tools of the private sector it would not just produce results but also rigorously measure their impact by the time their coffee grew cold rottenberg and kellner had sketched out the broad outlines of the endeavor model “it started with latin america but from the beginning we said this model could really apply to emerging markets around the world” she recalls a new type of benefactor in the next few months rottenberg left her job at ashoka and focused her energy on launching endeavor kellner agreed to assume an advisory role and to provide seed money contingent on rottenberg’s ability to find matching funds she approached foundations even though she knew that endeavor’s chances were slim at the time — the late s — less than  percent of us philanthropy went to international causes indeed every foundation she approached turned her down or suggested that she change her focus resolving to stay the course on her own terms rottenberg approached the private sector but her timing couldn’t have been worse the asian financial crisis of  had raised fears of a global economic meltdown and capital for new ventures in the developing world was scarce “everyone thought we were out of our minds” rottenberg says today she tells entrepreneurs that if people don’t think they’re crazy in the beginning they may not be thinking big enough in mid she persuaded stephan schmidheiny a swiss industrialist and philanthropist with a keen interest in latin america to match kellner’s investment by the end of the year endeavor had a board of directors and enough capital to begin operations based on what rottenberg termed the country benefactor model under the model endeavor whose global headquarters were rottenberg’s new york living room would recruit prominent business leaders within a country tasking them with forming a board and raising funds before the organization would agree to set up a local office once established these offices would be informed by local values and would be expected to achieve selfsufficiency within a few years endeavor’s board agreed that potential countries for their program should have a base level of highpotential entrepreneurs a cadre of successful business leaders who would support endeavor’s mission a strong academic system and political stability “we look at countries transitioning from international aid to international investment” rottenberg says “it’s about spotlighting the countries as well as the entrepreneurs our model actually isn’t right for countries at the most basic level of development” the selection of entrepreneurs would be based on six essential characteristics entrepreneurial initiative potential for changing or improving their industry ability to generate substantial revenue wages and jobs integrity role model potential and “fit” with endeavor once selected these entrepreneurs would gain access to a targeted set of support services strategic consulting a customized month assessment plan access to mentors onsite fellows from top business schools entrée to venture capital road shows and personalized introductions to investors entrepreneurs would ultimately be required to donate both time and money — in the form of either a percentage of equity or incremental profits — to those following in their footsteps it was this virtuous circle rottenberg believed that would create the ripple effects needed for ongoing innovation models of empreendedorismo in january  endeavor opened its first country office in chile that august an argentine office followed the chilean office proved to be a false start — a lack of local buyin forced it to close its doors until it could garner the necessary support to successfully relaunch which it did in  — but endeavor argentina flourished its first batch of entrepreneurs included andy freire and santiago bilinkis the then yearold founders of officenet a company aimed at revolutionizing latin america’s fragmented and inefficient office supply industry neither freire nor bilinkis had access to capital and the sole investor willing to give them money had demanded  percent ownership of the company whereas entrepreneurs in a more developed market would have turned down the faustian bargain freire and bilinkis felt resigned to accept it in a country without a culture of venture capital or local role models they saw no other option they forged ahead and built up the company but they knew they lacked the resources that would be necessary to expand — in addition to lacking even the smallest stake in their own company endeavor’s involvement quickly changed that the organization’s network of venture capitalists helped freire and bilinkis renegotiate their ownership terms to  percent equity participation in addition endeavor’s roster of mentors helped the two strengthen their finance growth and leadership models and connected them with a brazilian private equity firm officenet expanded into brazil and soon became the largest and fastestgrowing office supply business in latin america — also becoming an example of what is possible for other entrepreneurs in developing nations it is exactly this “role model effect” that rottenberg argues has been critically absent in emerging markets “access to capital is important but it’s not the ultimate barrier” she says “entrepreneurs in these countries lack that sense of ‘hey if he did it i can do it too’” endeavor’s network of entrepreneurs provides that sense of possibility she believes in fact rottenberg says around  percent of endeavor’s entrepreneurs are chosen precisely because they are considered “surefire successes… we want to signify that we are resultsoriented” she says “we expect our entrepreneurs to generate hundreds if not thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in revenue and our top  percent to be the next  million companies we make no bones about that you’ve got to have real success stories if you want to inspire others” another  percent of the organization’s sponsored entrepreneurs are “fast learners” — intelligent businesspeople who have interesting ideas but lack management experience and require intensive mentoring some  percent of endeavor’s entrepreneurs are “local stars” who have developed a regional brand but find themselves at an inflection point where they need support to expand their brand nationally or regionally “it’s actually not the startup that’s the trouble — people find crazy ways to launch new ideas” says rottenberg “it’s at the point where they hit  million or  million in sales that’s where they need to professionalize their management fire their motherinlaw or think beyond their borders and recalibrate their public franchising strategies” the rest of the organization’s entrepreneurs she says are “diamonds in the rough” — young talented individuals whose ideas might never get off the ground without external support wenceslao casares a yearold argentine entrepreneur selected in  is an example the son of a patagonian sheep rancher casares founded patagoncom argentina’s first online trading portal like many other young entrepreneurs in latin america he had made attempts to procure capital but was unsuccessful endeavor’s mentors provided him with strategic guidance and helped him negotiate a  million funding agreement with us venture capital firm flatiron partners less than two years later in a move that earned him almost mythic status among his peers casares sold a majority stake of patagon to banco santander for  million endeavor’s entrepreneurs have shown that they can overcome other obstacles in  the argentine economy crashed investor confidence plummeted unemployment soared to  percent argentines began withdrawing large sums of money from banks exchanging pesos for dollars protesters took to the streets of buenos aires and a state of emergency was declared yet in the midst of this chaos endeavor argentina’s entrepreneurs achieved substantial growth in revenues and employment “it’s always at a time of crisis that the best entrepreneurial ideas crop up” rottenberg says citing argentina’s experience as a perfect example of how a culture of entrepreneurship can take root in challenging conditions “entrepreneurs can capture a larger market share hire better talent and tackle problems more swiftly than large firms” a decade after the crash the new york times opined that endeavor had been “a catalyst” for argentina’s “evolving startup culture…which is now entirely locally run” similarly alan farcas endeavor chile’s managing director believes that since its successful relaunch in  the organization has changed his country’s business culture “ten years ago nobody in chile spoke about entrepreneurship it may sound strange but in emerging markets people don’t connect entrepreneurship with job creation and with making their country a better place to live the way they do in the united states ten years ago businesspeople were viewed as little more than thieves we’ve helped change that perception — people now view entrepreneurship as a force of good for both the economy and the country at large” what’s more farcas says highimpact entrepreneurship is now part of the lexicon according to endeavor’s metrics  percent of new ventures in developing and emerging economies have two employees endeavor’s entrepreneurs on the other hand employ an average of  in addition  percent of endeavor’s companies provide more benefits than those required by law and  percent of endeavor’s entrepreneurs have created companies that are the first in their industry in the entrepreneur’s country rottenberg believes that the secret to endeavor’s success is its builtin ripple effect “we have told the entrepreneurs all along that they have to pay it forward” she says “we make it clear that now that they’re successful they have to make sure that the environment is conducive to the next generation starting and scaling businesses our entrepreneurs understand that the top people in their country and on our global board did not put in money to make another few guys rich” in addition endeavor has focused on creating partnerships with governments universities the media and multilateral institutions since  more than  people have attended endeavor argentina’s annual entrepreneurship conference endeavor brazil — launched in  — hosts weekly online seminars they drew more than  million viewers in  alone rottenberg says that her proudest moment was when the editor of a leading brazilian dictionary told endeavor brazil that thanks to its efforts the dictionary was incorporating the word empreendedorismo or “entrepreneurship” in its next edition from “charming” to “important” by  endeavor had reached an inflection point of its own its four country affiliate offices had helped create  jobs at  companies across latin america with annual revenues totaling  million mass media coverage began to increase a harvard business school case study followed intrigued warner music group chairman and ceo edgar bronfman jr joined endeavor’s board “when i witness the power of endeavor’s model to pioneer entrepreneurship and to create opportunity inspiration and economic growth i am convinced that endeavor is instrumental in catapulting emerging markets out of international aid and firmly into international investment” he says yet bronfman was not without reservations “i believe in the model” he told rottenberg “but i think it’s charming if i am going to commit to this organization and get other people involved it needs to become important” rottenberg got the message to become “important” she believed endeavor would have to increase its rate of global expansion together with the board she established a target of operating in  countries by  — an exponential increase in the breadth of the organization if the plan succeeded it would put endeavor on the map both literally and figuratively in june  endeavor opened an office in south africa nearly a decade had passed since the end of apartheid but its aftereffects could still be felt extreme differences existed between the incomes of whites and blacks and only  percent of startups were created by black entrepreneurs unemployment was at  percent despite these challenges rottenberg believed that south africa had the creativity drive and talent necessary to emerge as a global innovation hub malik fal endeavor south africa’s managing director shared his goals in  with a national newspaper “we need to think about making entrepreneurship ‘cool’ and encourage young people not just to look for a job in the government or in a company where they will take a salary and that’s it” he said “it’s about creating a nobility of real entrepreneurship not cronyism it’s about finding a product seeing an opportunity building a business employing people and creating wealth in the true sense of the word — free of prejudice” over the next few years endeavor’s south african entrepreneurs created  jobs in a broad range of industries their companies which grew at an average annual rate of  percent were responsible for innovations that include a biometric security system designed to prevent fraud in african banks endeavor’s global expansion plans continued by  the organization had established offices in colombia and turkey egypt and jordan followed an indian affiliate was established in  but it failed to garner sufficient support and closed its doors a year later “when it’s not getting pulled in locally we know that it won’t work we would rather pull out and be pulled back in if and when it’s right than push the model on the region” rottenberg says looking ahead rottenberg views endeavor’s expansion as part of a larger trend in which social entrepreneurship moves into the mainstream in recent years she argues several highprofile individuals have helped create a tipping point of sorts for the concept in  u front man bono morphed from musician to social entrepreneur with the launch of product red a global campaign to fight aids in africa “in an instant social entrepreneurship became cool” rottenberg says later that year muhammad yunus’s nobel peace prize for his work in the field of microcredit gave the movement a recognizable leader in  bill gates launched his vision for creative capitalism “where business and nonprofits work together to create a market system that eases the world’s inequities” “gates really showed that whether entrepreneur or social entrepreneur it’s the same type of person the same mindset the same drive to solve problems” says rottenberg “after all the best entrepreneurs aren’t worried about money or exit strategies they’re solving problems and i think that some of the world’s greatest problems to be solved aren’t the next microprocessing chip but rather what we do about economic development healthcare education and the environment” rottenberg says that social entrepreneurs need to ask themselves three basic questions what’s currently being overlooked by both the government and the private sector where’s the need the gap the pain point where’s the opportunity to bridge a gap she believes that a major shift is occurring lines are becoming increasingly blurred between the sectors and she envisions a growing number of sectorambiguous boundarypushing entities that aim to combine the best of each sector and pursue the social good while discarding unwanted characteristics such as inefficiency corruption and a lack of accountability “there’s a merger now between the real forprofit companies that are trying to integrate social purpose into their core especially in areas like the environment and clean tech and nonprofits that realize that they need to have revenue streams and sustainability built in from the getgo” she says citing what she calls psychic equity — the benefits of being invested in and fulfilled by an undertaking — rottenberg says that organizations in the private sector should consider whether they are motivating their employees beyond bonuses aligning stakeholders’ values and interests and measuring impact beyond the next fiscal quarter in addition she argues “the private sector has to bring in multiple stakeholders and listen to constituents it doesn’t work to just have a commandandcontrol relationship you have to be much more partnershiporiented when you’re dealing with other countries” rottenberg also believes that social entrepreneurs “can help government deploy its resources more efficiently and effectively and track the impact of its social investments” rottenberg says that endeavor is on track to meet — and possibly even surpass — its goal of “ by ” a lebanese office opened in early  scoping missions are on the ground in the united arab emirates saudi arabia kenya indonesia the philippines and vietnam but will all this activity have enough impact in the end to propel a social entrepreneur like rottenberg from “charming” to “important” rottenberg quotes recent remarks made by former world bank president james wolfensohn “endeavor has played an instrumental role in promoting entrepreneurship as a tool for development it is a model that should be replicated around the world” that is exactly what she hopes to achieve if social entrepreneurship succeeds on a global scale it will be due in no small part to the efforts of rottenberg her colleagues and other likeminded people but in a larger sense it will represent an affirmation of the conviction underlying those efforts the conviction that the spirit of entrepreneurialism has always existed in all parts of the world — and that underdeveloped countries have only lacked the
