telecommunications by ward michael r read preview academic journal article economic inquiry product substitutability and competition in longdistance telecommunications by ward michael r read preview article excerpt i introduction the growing availability of detailed firmlevel data and advances in econometric techniques have led to the estimation of industry structural parameters in order to evaluate proposed policy changes hausman leonard and zona  in particular estimates of own and crosselasticities of demand are used to draw inferences about competition under various assumptions about producer behavior eg hausman  and stern  generating estimates of structural parameters requires not only price and demand data but often requires firmlevel factor price data to be used as instrumental variables even when firmlevel factor price data are available they may not fulfill the independence requirements of residual demand estimators because the competitors purchase from the same input market because the data requirements for the estimation of marshallian demand elasticities are less severe they may yield unbiased estimates residual demand elasticities can then be constructed under various assumptions about the extent of pricing coordination among producers this article carries out this process for the us longdistance telecommunications industry a unique and detailed data set that includes firmlevel output price and factor price information is employed the analysis focuses on the socalled basket  services which are ordinary interstate and international message toll service operator assistance and callingcard service these services are generally regarded as the ones in which att is likely to possess the most market power despite the detailed nature of the available data some of the factor prices are shown to lead to biased estimates when used as instrumental variables results from specifications that omit these instruments indicate that att faces a marshallian demand elasticity of about  residual demand elasticities are estimated for various assumptions regarding the degree of pricing coordination in the industry for plausible assumptions regarding the degree of price coordination among firms atts residual demand elasticity is likely below implying an industry deadweight loss of less than  revenues since the courts and the federal communications commission fcc opened us longdistance telecommunications to competitive entry the number and size of entrants has grown to the point that att once the legal monopolist now supplies less than half of the total market the fccs incremental approach to deregulating att decreased regulatory oversight in specific product markets as competition became more vigorous and culminated in its  decision to declare att nondominant essentially deregulating att the results of this analysis tend to support this decision nevertheless debate over the extent of competition continues primarily to evaluate the claim that allowing the bell operating companies bocs into these markets will yield consumer benefits from still more vigorous competition this analysis suggests that these benefits are likely to be small hence as brennan  points out the case for permitting boc entry into longdistance should focus on whether they are likely to provide the service at lower cost or whether they have scope for discriminatory actions rather than on whether they will make the longdistance market substantially more competitive ii previous studies the extent of competition in the us longdistance industry and the effects of price regulation have been the subject of policy interest and the focus of a few empirical studies macavoys  analyses lead him to conclude that the industry is increasingly collusive his event study finds that a portfolio of mci and sprint stock realizes positive abnormal returns when an att price increase is reported while this indicates that the industry is imperfectly competitive it could result from either unilateral or coordinated pricing behavior … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this article and over  million more from academic journals magazines and
