taking the guesswork out of nightlife by nate c hindman nightlife has always been one big guessing game show up at a bar wait in line and finally make it past the bouncer while wondering the whole time what lies behind the front door will it be too mobbed or too empty will the crowd be too young or too old too many men or too many women its a big problem says ben silbert the only way someone knows how crowded a bar is or the split of genders or ages is they actually have to go in or know somebody who is inside but silbert the founder of bar  club stats bcs a new nightlife startup is on a mission to take the guesswork out of going out his solution a system that gives users realtime demographic data at bars and nightclubs the soontolaunch site and app will allow prospective patrons to see the number of people who have entered a venue the ratio of men to women there the age of patrons and even patrons hometowns all without ever setting foot inside the place want a bar where at least  percent of the patrons are women from your hometown and no more than  percent are men from your least favorite city silberts tool tells you where to go so how does it collect the data get ready for the why didnt i think of that feeling id scanners you know those big clunky contraptions bouncers use to check whether your drivers license is real or fake silbert partnered with a technology company to offer bars a scanner that clips onto a bouncers iphone or ipod and extracts four pieces of data from a patrons id gender age zip code and time of entry the scanners extract the information anonymously meaning a patrons name or address is never transmitted to a third party the anonymous data then gets pushed in realtime to bcss site where users can view it to determine whether or not a venues current crowd is appealing nearly  bars and nightclubs in new york and new jersey have started using the scanners since silbert launched in november theyre using the scanners silbert says in part because the data extracted from ids offer businesses valuable insight into who their customers are silbert expects to launch the consumer app in june which means this summer you may be sending out far fewer how is it texts how did you come up with the idea one day i went to go meet my friend at a bar to watch a football game as i was walking over he shot me a text saying the bar is so packed it sucks but i went in anyway had a beer or two and we just sat there thinking this is terrible we dont want to fight people for a view of the game eventually we left and just wandered around for a while in search of a bar that was empty enough for us to watch the game it all made me think that theres got to be a better way what was the aha moment well we knew of a couple startups that had a similar idea to help people see what bars were like without actually going there they were installing cameras in bars and using digital imaging to generate demographic data on the people there or stream the images to a site where users can see the current patrons a bar in my area actually started using one but they got rid of it because their bar was too dark and it was a huge pain in the ass for the staff to change the film every night then it hit me what about the scanners that bouncers use to check ids at the front door ive seen how big bulky and ridiculous they are so we came up with the idea for an id scanner thats much better than the models on the market now and one that could work through an ipod or iphone we started talking to engineers and found this hardware that just came out in july which is mainly used for scanning inventory for walmart or retailers with millions of palettes of product i thought you know what lets try to use this thing for idscanning and here we are what is your vision for the consumer product we dont want to be the next yelp but we want our site and smartphone app to be thought of in the same breath when people go on their computers or phones on friday at  pm to see whats happening theyll go to yelp to find a bar they like and then theyll come to us to see what that bar was like last friday night or two friday nights ago theyll see that during the past few friday nights the bar got crowded around midnight with the right demographic and theyll say lets get there at  so we can beat the rush and post up at the bar were also working on a push notification type of thing so if you know you may want to go to a particular bar that night you can set up a notification for when that bar has more than say 0 entries and  percent of those entries are women and if and when that happens youll receive a notification on your phone whats your pitch to bar and club owners why would they want to equip their bouncers with your scanners for one it will save them money the generic model that most bars own go for about  our scanners we either rent out for  a month or sell outright for  also generic scanners dont have any communication ability if youre a bar owner and want to find out everybody who was at your bar youd have to plug the scanner into a usb port in your computer and then upload the info through excel our scanners extract four pieces of anonymous information  time of entry age gender and zip code  and will push the data to our site where owners can view it in just a few clicks theyll be able to go to our site and plug in the time they want demographic data for for example if they think that they were incredibly profitable towards the end of thursday night they can take a peek at  pm to  am they may see that  percent of the people in the bar were somethings from long island now they know to focus their marketing efforts on getting those people in the bar again but why would bars and nightclubs want you to share their venues demographic data with the world i believe theres a certain demographic that appeals to somebody out there if youve got an empty bar on your hands that could appeal to somebody if your bar is filled with men in their s that might appeal to somebody in addition by sharing their information for our users to consume theyre having a direct interaction with potential customers  and thats valuable for instance they can leverage that interaction to target consumers with incentives such as deals on drinks at a certain hour what about when a patron leaves the bar can you track that no we cannot is that something that might hurt the viability of the app it remains to be seen weve kicked around the idea of creating some sort of formula that factors in the time of entry and historical data to predict how long a patron will stick around but listen no technology is perfect were just going to be open with users and tell them that this isnt a perfect measure of whos there but its a lot better than whats out there now which is mostly just guesswork have you filed a patent on these scanners weve filed a provisional patent but not on the scanners our patent application is for the method of producing patron data based on identification card scans and what about the apps name are you sticking with bar  club stats the name for the consumer app is definitely going to be different
