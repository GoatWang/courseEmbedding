in this annual report on form k for the year ended march   our future results could be impacted by many developments in march  john morrell  co a subsidiary of smithfield foods inc became nathans exclusive licensee to manufacture and sell hot dogs sausage and corned beef at retail our future operating results are substantially depended on our agreement with john morrell  co there are also certain risks associated with engaging john morrell  co as exclusive licensee including whether i we can maintain or improve the quality and consistency of our products that is expected by our customers and ii john morrell  co will have a sufficient supply of products available for our customers on a timely basis as well as the risks described under risk factors   our licensing revenue is substantially depended on our agreement with john morrell  co and the loss or a significant reduction of this revenue would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our future operating results could be impacted by supply constraints on beef prices andor increases in beef prices on march   we consummated a  million offering of notes and subsequently paid a dividend of  per share or approximately  million in the aggregate as we consummated the notes offering on march   we were only required to accrue interest expense for  days during fiscal  in contrast the full year impact of interest expense on net income has been reflected in our year end results for the periods ended march   and march   our future results could also be impacted by our interest obligations under the notes as a result of the issuance of the notes nathans expects to incur interest expense of  million per annum and annual amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately  the indenture governing the notes imposes operating and other restrictions on us during the fiscal year ending march   we paid interest of  on each september   and march   critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we believe the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts revenue recognition sales by companyowned restaurants which are typically paid in cash by the customer are recognized at the point of sale sales are presented net of sales tax in connection with its franchising operations nathans receives initial franchise fees area development fees royalties and in certain cases revenue from subleasing restaurant properties to franchisees franchise and area development fees which are typically received prior to completion of the revenue recognition process are recorded as deferred revenue initial franchise fees which are nonrefundable are recognized as income when substantially all services to be performed by nathans and conditions relating to the sale of the franchise have been performed or satisfied which generally occurs when the franchised restaurant commences operations the following services are typically provided by nathans prior to the opening of a franchised restaurant  approval of all site selections to be developed development fees are nonrefundable and the related agreements require the franchisee to open a specified number of restaurants in the development area within a specified time period or the agreements may be canceled by the company revenue from development agreements is deferred and shall be recognized with an appropriate provision for estimated uncollectible amounts when all material services or conditions to the sale have been substantially performed by the franchisor if substantial obligations under the development agreement are not dependent on the number of individual franchise locations to be opened substantial performance shall be determined using the same criteria applicable to an individual franchise which is generally the opening of the first location pursuant to the development agreement if substantial performance is dependent on the number of locations then the development fee is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement as restaurants in the development area commence operations on a pro rata basis to the minimum number of restaurants required to be open or at the time the development agreement is effectively canceled nathans recognizes franchise royalties on a monthly basis which are generally based upon a percentage of sales made by nathans franchisees when they are earned and deemed collectible franchise fees and royalties that are not deemed to be collectible are not recognized as revenue until paid by the franchisee or until collectability is deemed to be reasonably assured nathans recognizes revenue from its branded menu program either upon its sale of hot dogs or royalty income when it has been determined that other qualifying products have been sold by the manufacturer to nathans branded menu program franchisees nathans recognizes revenue from the branded product program upon delivery to nathans customers via third party common carrier to nathans customers rebates to customers are recorded as a reduction to sales revenue from subleasing properties is recognized as income as the revenue is earned and becomes receivable and deemed collectible sublease rental income is presented net of associated lease costs in the consolidated statements of earnings nathans recognizes revenue from royalties on the licensing of the use of its intellectual property in connection with certain products produced and sold by outside vendors the use of the nathans intellectual property must be approved by nathans prior to each specific application to ensure proper quality and project a consistent image revenue from license royalties is recognized on a monthly basis when it is earned and deemed collectible in the normal course of business we extend credit to franchisees and licensees for the payment of ongoing royalties and to trade customers of our branded product program accounts and other receivables net as shown on our consolidated balance sheets are net of allowances for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements assessment of collectability based upon historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions in the event that the collectability of a receivable at the date of the transaction is doubtful the associated revenue is not recorded until the facts and circumstances change in accordance with the applicable accounting standards the company writes off accounts receivable when they are deemed uncollectible impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets are deemed to have indefinite lives and accordingly are not amortized but are evaluated annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for impairment the most significant assumptions which are used in this test are estimates of future cash flows we typically use the same assumptions for this test as we use in the development of our business plans if these assumptions differ significantly from actual results impairment charges may be required in the future we conducted our annual impairment tests and no goodwill or other intangible assets were determined to be impaired during the fiscal years ended march   march   and march   impairment of longlived assets longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the longlived assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the assets and their ultimate disposition in instances where impairment is determined to exist the company writes down the asset to its fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets on a restaurantbyrestaurant basis whenever impairment factors are determined to be present the company considers a history of restaurant operating losses to be its primary indicator of potential impairment for individual restaurant locations no impairment charges on longlived assets were recorded during the fiscal years ended march   march   and march   impairment of longterm investment we make judgments regarding the future realizability of this investment based upon the financial information provided to us by the investments management we typically rely on managements assumptions of future revenues and cash flows based upon the annual business plans presented if these assumptions differ significantly from actual results we consider whether indicators of impairment exist if an impairment indicator exists management evaluates the fair value of its investment to determine if an other than temporary impairment in value has occurred we have annually performed our evaluation of whether indicators of impairment existed and determined that an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred and recorded impairment charges of  and  on this investment during the fiftytwo week periods ended march   and march   respectively we have not recognized any further impairment on our longterm investments during the fiftytwo week period ended march   stockbased compensation as discussed in note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements we have one active sharebased compensation plan that provides stock options and restricted stock awards for certain employees and nonemployee directors to acquire shares of our common stock we consider the following factors in determining the value of stockbased compensation a expected option term based upon expected termination behavior income taxes the companys current provision for income taxes is based upon its estimated taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates after considering the impact on taxable income of temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and any operating loss or tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible should management determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets would be established in the period such determination was made uncertain tax positions financial accounting standards establish guidance for the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement financial accounting standards also provide guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements see note j of the notes to consolidated financial statements adoption of new accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued new guidance which addresses how companies account for certain aspects of its sharebased payments to employees the update simplifies the accounting for the tax consequences it also amends how excess tax benefits and a companys payments to cover the tax bills for the shares recipients should be classified on the statement of cash flows related to sharebased payments to employees the amendments allow companies to estimate the number of stock awards they expect to vest and the amendments revised the withholding requirements for classifying stock awards as equity previously tax withholding was permitted only at the minimum statutory tax rates which is being amended to permit higher income tax withholding as long as it does not exceed the maximum statutory tax rate for an employee in the applicable jurisdictions this new standard is effective for public companies with fiscal years beginning after december   which will be nathans first quarter ending june  of our fiscal year ending on march   however early adoption is permitted the company elected to early adopt this standard in the quarter ended june   the impact of the early adoption resulted in the company recording a tax benefit of  within income tax expense for the fiftytwo weeks ended march   related to the excess tax benefit on stock incentive awards that settled during these periods the company did not record any tax benefit during the fourth fiscal quarter ended march   prior to adoption of this guidance these amounts would have increased additional paidin capital these items shall not be factored into the projected annual income tax rate but will be treated as discrete items when they occur accordingly this new treatment will add additional volatility in the companys effective tax rate the excess tax benefits for the years ended march   and march   were  and  respectively which increased additional paidincapital the company accounts for forfeitures as they occur under the new guidance excess tax benefits related to employee sharebased payments of  are classified as operating activities in the statement of cash flows for the fiftytwo weeks ended march   the company applied the effect of the guidance to the presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows prospectively and no prior periods have been adjusted the company did not record any cumulativeeffect adjustment to accumulated deficit or net assets as a result of adopting this new accounting standard the company also modified its diluted earnings per share calculation by excluding the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of our diluted earnings per share for the thirteen and fiftytwo weeks ended march   in august  the fasb issued new guidance that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events considered in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued if such conditions exist management is required to include disclosures enabling users to understand those conditions and managements plans to alleviate or mitigate those conditions this new standard is effective for annual periods ending after december   and interim periods within annual periods beginning after december   this guidance was effective for the company beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and did not have a material impact on the companys results of operations or financial position new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in may  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that attempts to establish a uniform basis for recording income to virtually all industries financial statements under us gaap as further amended during  the fasb issued certain updates to the standard including clarifying reporting revenue between principle versus agent and clarification in determining performance obligations and licenses guidance the revenue standards core principle is built on the contract between a vendor and a customer for the provision of goods and services it attempts to depict the exchange of rights and obligations between the parties in the pattern of revenue recognition based on the consideration to which the vendor is entitled in order to accomplish this objective companies must evaluate the following five basic steps i identify the contract with the customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation there are two basic transition methods that are available  full retrospective or modified retrospective transition methods early adoption is prohibited public companies were originally expected to apply the new standard for annual periods beginning after december   including interim periods therein which for nathans would have been its first quarter of fiscal  beginning on march   on july   the fasb agreed to delay the standards effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after december   which will now be our first quarter june  of our fiscal year ending march   the company does not believe that the standard will impact its recognition of revenue for its branded product program companyoperated restaurants or its recognition of royalties from its franchised restaurants or retail licenses which are based on a percentage of sales currently franchise and international development fees are recognized when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the agreements which is generally when the franchisee begins operations under the new guidance these fees may be recognized over the term of the agreements the company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of asu  on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet selected a transition method the company anticipates assigning internal resources to assist with the evaluation and implementation of the new standard and will continue to provide updates during fiscal year  in july  the fasb updated us accounting guidance to simplify the ways businesses measure inventory companies that use the firstin firstout fifo method or the average cost method will measure inventory at the lower of its cost or net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business minus the cost of completion disposal and transportation companies will no longer consider replacement cost or net realizable value less a normal profit margin when measuring inventory this new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   which will be our first quarter june  of our fiscal year ending march   nathans does not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position in february  the fasb issued a new accounting standard on leases the new standard among other changes will require lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases the lease liability will be measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term the rightofuse asset will be measured at the lease liability amount adjusted for lease prepayments lease incentives received and the lessees initial direct costs eg commissions the new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods this standard is required to take effect in nathans first quarter ending june  of our fiscal year ending march   the adoption will require a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest period presented the company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial position and results of operations in january  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that narrows the definition of a business the concept is fundamental in determining whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses the asu revised the definition of a business to consist of the following key concepts  a business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends lower costs or other economic benefits directly to investors or other owners members or participants the amendments are effective prospectively for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after december   this standard is required to take effect in nathans first quarter ending june  of our fiscal year ending march   the company does not expect this new accounting standard will have a material effect on the companys results of operations cash flows or financial position early adoption is permitted when certain criteria are met the company does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards when adopted will have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements results of operations fiscal year
