from the room walls following these guidelines will give you a chandelier that will appear to fill the space without overcrowding itin a living room or entryway for every foot of ceiling height allow  inches in chandelier height for example a foot ceiling would require a inch high design to determine the width needed add the length and width of your room and convert the total to inches for example a room thats feet x feet would require a design thats around inches wide  plus  gives you the width of how to hang a chandelierfinding the correct chandelier height can be problematic unless you know the dimensions of the room use the following guidelines to help you through the processwhen hanging over a dining room table for an foot standard ceiling the bottom of the chandelier should hang thirty to thirtyfour inches over the tableadd three inches more for each additional foot of ceiling heightif you are hanging a large chandelier or one that is very heavy we suggest using a joist brace
