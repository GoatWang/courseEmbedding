peptide advantages over antibody drugs oral administration localized delivery with higher drug concentrations at site of active disease reduced risk of infections due to injections or infusions greater convenience leads to increased compliance in patients improved safety and tolerability oral and girestricted delivery minimizes systemic exposure in the blood peptides can be cleared more quickly from systemic circulation likelihood of lower immunogenicity and reduces the risk of loss of response costeffectiveness lower cost of production storage and shipment less complex manufacturing processes required pipeline we are a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary technology platform focused on discovering and developing peptidebased new chemical entities nces to address significant unmet medical needs our primary focus is on developing firstinclass oral peptide drugs that specifically target biological pathways also targeted by currently marketed injectable antibody drugs compared to injectable antibody drugs our oral peptides offer targeted delivery to the gastrointestinal gi tissue compartment potential for improved safety due to minimal exposure in the blood improved convenience and compliance due to oral delivery and the opportunity for earlier introduction of targeted therapy for inflammatory bowel disease ibd our initial lead product candidates ptg and ptg are based on this approach and we believe they have the potential to transform the existing treatment paradigm for ibd a gi disease consisting primarily of ulcerative colitis uc and crohn’s disease cd ibd is a chronic inflammatory disease with significant unmet medical need which has created a large and growing market with an estimated  million patients in the united states in  as of  annual direct treatment costs for patients with ibd in the united states were estimated to exceed  billion with indirect costs estimated to be an additional  billion in  global data estimated that the uc and cd markets reached approximately  billion and  billion respectively across ten major markets and global data estimates that these markets are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately  to  through  the current tumor necrosis factoralpha tnfα antibody drugs approved for moderatetosevere ibd humira® and remicade® are both injectable according to global data the  sales for humira® and remicade® for ibd were  billion in the united states approximately one third of ibd patients are nonresponders to tnfα antibody drugs and approximately another  to  become refractory within the first year of treatment additionally tnfα antibody drugs may predispose patients to an increased risk of serious infection and the development of antidrug antibodies adas which over time can cause loss of drug response thus while available treatments exist for moderatetosevere ibd there continues to be a significant medical need for efficacious safer and convenient treatments rd pipeline oral peptides based targeted therapy for gi diseases and disorders protagonist leverages its proprietary peptide technology platform to discover and develop novel product candidates to treat diseases with significant unmet medical needs program dosing form indication preclinical phase  phase  anticipated milestones ptg oral αβ antagonist initiate phase b

potential firstinclass oral alphabeta αβ integrinspecific antagonist peptide product candidate which has now completed a phase  clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers nhvs and is being developed initially for potential treatment of moderatetosevere ulcerative colitis uc αβ integrin is considered to be one of the most gispecific biological targets for ibd due to its binding to madcam an extracellular protein that resides mostly in the gi vasculature ptg a potential firstinclass oral ilr antagonist for the treatment of moderatetosevere ibd ptg is a potential firstinclass oral interleukin receptor ilr antagonist being developed initially for moderatetosevere cd ptg is currently in investigational new drug ind enabling studies and we plan to initiate a phase  clinical trial in  we believe ptg and ptg have the potential to transform the existing ibd treatment paradigm because they offer significant advantages over injectable antibody drugs these complementary assets target different biological pathways and potentially offer improved convenience patient compliance and safety and tolerability compared to currently approved injectable antibody drugs we believe these potential advantages could allow our products to replace and expand the ibd market beyond the moderatetosevere ibd patient population currently treated by injectable antibody drugs ptg an injectable hepcidin mimetic being developed to treat iron overload disorders our novel peptides have potential applicability in a wide range of therapeutic areas in addition to gi diseases our first product candidate beyond ibd is ptg an injectable hepcidin mimetic which is currently in preclinical development ptg has potential utility for the treatment of iron overload disorders such as transfusiondependent βthalassemia hereditary hemochromatosis hh and sickle cell disease scd each of which may qualify for orphan designation back to top corporate headquarters protagonist therapeutics
