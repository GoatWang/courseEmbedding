goal line making these two biotech stocks far better picks cory renauer tmfangapples feb   at am investors are right to focus on potential alzheimers disease drugs because of the huge market but anavex life sciences corp nasdaqavxl is an awfully long way from from the finish line with its lead candidate clinicalstage biotech stocks are inherently risky but id like to walk you through some figures that show why geron corporation nasdaqgern and its cancer drugs might make a better addition to your portfolio if youd like to stay within the alzheimers disease space acadia pharmaceuticals nasdaqacad also has a compelling opportunity to expand its lead drug into this underserved space and beyond image source getty images both geron and acadia present risks but both stocks have a better chance of providing marketbeating gains over the long term than anavex heres why geron pharmaceuticals advancing a contender anavex and geron dont have a product to sell yet but it looks like the latter has a much better chance of bringing its first clinicalstage drug into the commercial arena gerons lead candidate imetelstat appears to have an important advantage over the leading treatment jakafi for a rare form of blood cancer known as myelofibrosis a disorder marked by overactive blood cell production in bone marrow in  jakafi from incyte earned approval to treat myelofibrosis based on observed spleen size reductions enlarged spleens are a key myelofibrosis symptom but the therapys lackluster improvement in year survival rates to  over  observed in a group receiving a placebo suggests a strong contender could quickly earn a significant share of the available patient population in a trial that enrolled  myelofibrosis patients gerons imetelstat generated a clinical response defined in part by an observed improvement on bone marrow damage among about  of patients furthermore  experienced a complete remission defined by complete reversal of damage by contrast anavexs lead candidates ability to slow progression of cognitive decline among alzheimers patients is questionable at best so far the only clinicalefficacy data for the drug consists of a lessthanimpressive change in cognitive ability test scores from baseline without a control group for comparison observations to data are hardly worth getting excited about observed responses in patients treated with gerons imetelstat though is the sort of data worth getting excited about another advantage geron has over anavex is a deeppocketed partner ready to fund a trial large enough to support an application anavex wrapped up a midstage study with its lead candidate but hasnt begun a larger more expensive latestage trial yet the company is open to collaboration to continue its development but hasnt announced one yet  geron on the other hand is far less likely to delay development due to a lack of resources its partner johnson  johnson is awaiting more data this year from imetelstat if midstage trial results fall in line with previous observations jj will fund a latestage study and possibly commercialization activities cutting geron checks for milestones and royalties along the way as gerons market cap is just  million at recent prices success for imetelstat could lead to marketcrushing gains over the long run acadia pharmaceuticals an important expansion if youre looking for a biotech with potential upside and a commercialstage product youll want to consider the purveyor of the first drug specifically approved to treat parkinsons disease psychosis an estimated  of an estimated  million us parkinsons disease patients suffer delusions and hallucinations and treating these symptoms is a huge burden on families and healthcare budgets acadias nuplazid generated  million in sales during its first full quarter on pharmacy shelves and is expected to climb much higher with it having the parkinsons disease indication essentially to itself acadias recent market cap of around  billion suggests a great deal of success for the drug is already priced in but a possible expansion to the much larger alzheimers disease ad indication could send the stock higher still so how is acadia faring in its quest for expanding nuplazids label well acadias shares slid recently after topline data barely squeaked by with a statistically significant reduction in psychosis test scores among ad patients at six weeks while the slim success is concerning its also important to note nuplazid wasnt associated with impairedcognition side effects sadly antipsychotics currently available for alzheimers patients often exacerbate the diseases main symptom cognitive decline which cold give nuplazid an advantage if trials for ad psychosis dont clear a path for expansion to this enormous population an ongoing midstage trial for ad agitation could do the job ad agitation affects perhaps half of americas  million ad patients and often leads to costly nursinghome placement given the lack of available treatment options for ad psychosis or agitation nuplazids lack of adverse cognitive side effects could make it popular enough to generate more than  billion in annual sales with an expansion to such a large population image source getty images beyond parkinsons and alzheimers acadia also has a chance to expand nuplazid to the large schizophrenia indication schizophrenia affects about  of the the adult population in the us and perhaps  suffer an inadequate response to existing antipsychotics the company is running a latestage trial that could support an application for the medicine to become the first treatment for this group as well further out a midstage trial will shed more light on nuplazids potential as an additional treatment for a majority of americas  million adults with major depressive disorder inadequately managed by their existing therapies of course if nuplazid remains locked into parkinsons disease without a chance of expanding to any of these additional indications investors would probably suffer losses unlike anavex though acadia has already proved it can advance a drug from clinical to commercial stage labelexpansion approvals are far from certain but several trials that could lead to key expansions under way give the stock a much better chance of beating the broad market in the long run cory renauer owns shares of johnson and johnson which the motley fool

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples
