the varying rated current definitions constant current definition see faktor fi the following applies in fuse ioperating max x fi x ft tvalue currenttimeintegralin case of pulse loading and for semiconductor protection a suitable current rating can also be ascertained with the help of the i the above mentioned two points will help you to ascertain the most suitable current rating of a fuse link and its prearcing time limits if necessary verify experimentally the necessary breaking capacity of the fuse link is determined by the max possible fault current which can occur in addition to the abovementioned points the method of installation is also important for correct fuse link selection taking into consideration possible approvals with regard to specific conditions of any particular

mount rfi shielded etc application testing and verification prior to production littelfuse fuse packaging and part numbering systems definitions and terms ambient temperature refers to the temperature of the air immediately surrounding the fuse and is not to be confused with “room temperature” the fuse ambient temperature is appreciably higher in many cases because it is enclosed as in a panel mount fuseholder or mounted near other heat producing components such as resistors transformers etc breaking capacity also known as interrupting rating or short circuit rating this is the maximum approved current which the fuse can safely break at rated voltage please refer to the interrupting rating definition of this section for additional information current rating the nominal amperage value of the fuse it is established by the manufacturer as a value of current which the fuse can carry based on a controlled set of test conditions see rerating catalog fuse part numbers include series identification and amperage ratings refer to the fuse selection guide section for guidance on making the proper choice rerating for ºc ambient temperatures it is recommended that fuses be operated at no more than  of the nominal current rating established using the controlled test conditions these test conditions are part of ulcsaance mexico  “fuses for supplementary overcurrent protection” whose primary objective is to specify common test standards necessary for the continued control of manufactured items intended for protection against fire etc some common variations of these standards include fully enclosed fuseholders high contact resistances air movement transient spikes and changes in connecting cablesize diameter and length fuses are essentially temperaturesensitive devices even small variations from the controlled test conditions can greatly affect the predicted life of a fuse when it is loaded to its nominal value usually expressed as  of rating the circuit design engineer should clearly understand that the purpose of these controlled test conditions is to enable fuse manufacturers to maintain unified performance standards for their products and he must account for the variable conditions of his application to compensate for these variables the circuit design engineer who is designing for troublefree longlife fuse protection in his equipment generally loads his fuse not more than  of the nominal rating listed by the manufacturerkeeping in mind that overload and short circuit protection must be adequately provided for the fuses under discussion are temperaturesensitive devices whose ratings have been established in a ºc ambient the fuse temperature generated by the current passing through the fuse increases or decreases with ambient temperature change the ambient temperature chart in the fuse selection guide section illustrates the effect that ambient temperature has on the nominal current rating of a fuse most traditional sloblo® fuse designs use lower melting temperature materials and are therefore more sensitive to ambient temperature changes dimensions unless otherwise specified dimensions are in inches the fuses in this catalog range in size from the approx  chip size ”l x ”w x ”h up to the  ag also commonly known as a”midget” fuse ” dia x ” length as new products were developed throughout the years fuse sizes evolved to fill the various electrical circuit protection needs the first fuses were simple openwire devices followed in the ’s by edison’s enclosure of thin wire in a lamp base to make the first plug fuse by  underwriters laboratories had established size and rating specifications to meet safety standards the renewable type fuses and automotive fuses appeared in  and in  littelfuse started making very low amperage fuses for the budding electronics industry the fuse sizes in following chart began with the early “automobile glass” fuses thus the term “ag” the numbers were applied chronologically as different manufacturers started making a new size “ag” for example was the third size placed on the market other nonglass fuse sizes and constructions were determined by functional requirements but they still retained the length or diameter dimensions of the glass fuses their designation was modified to ab in place of ag indicating that the outer tube was constructed from bakelite fibre ceramic or a similar material other than glass the largest size fuse shown in the chart is the ag or “midget” a name adopted from its use by the electrical industry and the national electrical code range which normally recognizes fuses of ” x ” as the smallest standard fuse in use industrial fuses and how they work view the littelfuse powrgard catalog for complete fuse selection information an important part of developing quality overcurrent protection is an understanding of system needs and overcurrent protective device fundamentals this section discusses these topics with special attention to the application of fuses if you have additional questions call our technical support and engineering services group at tecfuse  why overcurrent protection all electrical systems eventually experience overcurrents unless removed in time even moderate overcurrents quickly overheat system components damaging insulation conductors and equipment large overcurrents may melt conductors and vaporize insulation very high currents produce magnetic forces that bend and twist bus bars these high currents can pull cables from their terminals and crack insulators and spacers too frequently fires explosions poisonous fumes and panic accompany uncontrolled overcurrents this not only damages electrical systems and equipment but may cause injury or death to personnel nearby to reduce these hazards the national electrical code® nec® osha regulations and other applicable design and installation standards require overcurrent protection that will disconnect overloaded or faulted equipment industry and governmental organizations have developed performance standards for overcurrent devices and testing procedures that show compliance with the standards and with the nec these organizations include the american national standards institute ansi national electrical manufacturers association nema and the national fire protection association nfpa all of which work in conjunction with nationally recognized testing laboratories nrtl such as underwriters laboratories ul electrical systems must meet applicable code requirements including those for overcurrent protection before electric utilities are allowed to provide electric power to a facility what is quality overcurrent protection a system with quality overcurrent protection has the following characteristics meets all legal requirements such as nec osha local codes etc provides maximum safety for personnel exceeding minimum code requirements as necessary minimizes overcurrent damage to property equipment and electrical systems provides coordinated protection only the protective device immediately on the line side of an overcurrent opens to protect the system and minimize unnecessary downtime is cost effective while providing reserve interrupting capacity for future growth consists of equipment and components not subject to obsolescence and requiring only minimum maintenance that can be performed by regular maintenance personnel using readily available tools and equipment overcurrent types and effects an overcurrent is any current that exceeds the ampere rating of conductors equipment or devices under conditions of use the term overcurrent includes both overloads and shortcircuits overloads an overload is an overcurrent confined to normal current paths in which there is no insulation breakdown sustained overloads are commonly caused by installing excessive equipment such as additional lighting fixtures or too many motors sustained overloads are also caused by overloading mechanical equipment and by equipment breakdown such as failed bearings if not disconnected within established time limits sustained overloads eventually overheat circuit components causing thermal damage to insulation and other system components overcurrent protective devices must disconnect circuits and equipment experiencing continuous or sustained overloads before overheating occurs even moderate insulation overheating can seriously reduce the life of the components andor equipment involved for example motors overloaded by just  may experience less than  of normal insulation life temporary overloads occur frequently common causes include temporary equipment overloads such as a machine tool taking too deep of a cut or simply the starting of an inductive load such as a motor since temporary overloads are by definition harmless overcurrent protective devices should not open or clear the circuit it is important to realize that fuses selected must have sufficient timedelay to allow motors to start and temporary overloads to subside however should the overcurrent continue fuses must then open before system components are damaged littelfuse powrpro® and powrgard® timedelay fuses are designed to meet these types of protective needs in general timedelay fuses hold  of the rated current for a minimum of ten seconds yet will still open quickly on higher values of current even though governmentmandated highefficiency motors and nema design e motors have much higher locked rotor currents powrpro® timedelay fuses such as the flsrid llsrkid or idsr series have sufficient timedelay to permit motors to start when the fuses are properly selected in accordance with the nec® shortcircuits a shortcircuit is an overcurrent flowing outside of its normal path types of shortcircuits are generally divided into three categories bolted faults arcing faults and ground faults each type of shortcircuit is defined in the terms and definitions section a shortcircuit is caused by an insulation breakdown or faulty connection during a circuits normal operation the connected load determines current when a shortcircuit occurs the current bypasses the normal load and takes a shorter path hence the term ‘shortcircuit since there is no load impedance the only factor limiting current flow is the total distribution systems impedance from the utilitys generators to the point of fault a typical electrical system might have a normal load impedance of  ohms but in a singlephase situation the same system might have a load impedance of  ohms or less in order to compare the two scenarios it is best to apply ohms law i  er for ac systems a  volt singlephase circuit with the  ohm load impedance would draw  amperes    if the same circuit has a  ohm system impedance when the load is shorted the available fault current would increase significantly to  amperes    as stated shortcircuits are currents that flow outside of their normal path regardless of the magnitude of overcurrent the excessive current must be removed quickly if not removed promptly the large currents associated with shortcircuits may have three profound effects on an electrical system heating magnetic stress and arcing heating occurs in every part of an electrical system when current passes through the system when overcurrents are large enough heating is practically instantaneous the energy in such overcurrents is measured in amperesquared seconds it an overcurrent of  amperes that lasts for  seconds has an it of  as if the current could be reduced from  amperes to  amperes for the same period of time the corresponding it would be reduced to  as or just one percent of the original value if the current in a conductor increases  times the it increases  times a current of only  amperes can melt a  awg copper wire in  second within eight milliseconds  seconds or onehalf cycle a current of  amperes can raise the temperature of  awg thhn thermoplastic insulated copper wire from its operating temperature of °c to its maximum shortcircuit temperature of °c any currents larger than this may immediately vaporize organic insulations arcs at the point of fault or from mechanical switching such as automatic transfer switches or circuit breakers may ignite the vapors causing violent explosions and electrical flash magnetic stress or force is a function of the peak current squared fault currents of  amperes can exert forces of more than  lb per foot of bus bar stresses of this magnitude may damage insulation pull conductors from terminals and stress equipment terminals sufficiently such that significant damage occurs arcing at the point of fault melts and vaporizes all of the conductors and components involved in the fault the arcs often burn through raceways and equipment enclosures showering the area with molten metal that quickly starts fires andor injures any personnel in the area additional shortcircuits are often created when vaporized material is deposited on insulators and other surfaces sustained arcingfaults vaporize organic insulation and the vapors may explode or burn whether the effects are heating magnetic stress andor arcing the potential damage to electrical systems can be significant as a result of shortcircuits occurring ii selection considerations selection considerations for fuses  volts and below since overcurrent protection is crucial to reliable electrical system operation and safety overcurrent device selection and application should be carefully considered when selecting fuses the following parameters or considerations need to be evaluated current rating voltage rating interrupting rating type of protection and fuse characteristics current limitation physical size indication general industrial fusing recommendations based on the above selection considerations the following is recommended fuses with ampere ratings from  through  amperes when available fault currents are less than  amperes and when equipment does not require the more currentlimiting characteristics of ul class rk fuses flnr and flsrid series class rk currentlimiting fuses provide superior timedelay and cycling characteristics at a lower cost than rk fuses if available fault currents exceed  amperes equipment may need the additional currentlimitation capabilities

applications requiring spacesaving iec type  protection class cc and class cd series fuses are used in control circuits and control panels where space is at a premium the littelfuse powrpro ccmr series fuses are best used for protection of small motors while the littelfuse kldr series fuses provide optimal protection for control power transformers and similar devices for questions about product applications call our technical support group at tecfuse fuses with ampere ratings from  through  amperes for superior protection of most generalpurpose and motor circuits it is recommended to use the powrpro® klpc series class l fuses the class l fuses are the only timedelay fuse series available in these higher ampere ratings information on all the littelfuse fuse series referenced above can be found on the ulcsa fuse classes and applications charts found in the technical application guide at the end of the powrgard products catalog industrial circuit protection checklist to select the proper overcurrent protective device for an electrical system circuit and system designers should ask themselves the following questions before a system is designed what is the normal or average current expected what is the maximum continuous three hours or more current expected what inrush or temporary surge currents can be expected are the overcurrent protective devices able to distinguish between expected inrush and surge currents and open under sustained overloads and fault conditions what kind of environmental extremes are possible dust humidity temperature extremes and other factors need to be considered what is the maximum available fault current the protective device may have to interrupt is the overcurrent protective device rated for the system voltage will the overcurrent protective device provide the safest and most reliable protection for the specific equipment under shortcircuit conditions will the overcurrent protective device minimize the possibility of a fire or explosion does the overcurrent protective device meet all the applicable safety standards and installation requirements answers to these questions and other criteria will help to determine the type overcurrent protection device to use for optimum safety reliability and performance search by parameter product category ag xmm fuses xmm fuses abag xmm xmm fuses xmm fuses aecq compliant fuses
