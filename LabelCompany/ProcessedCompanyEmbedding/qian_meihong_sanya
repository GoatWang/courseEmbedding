presented herein have been included in the financial statements all such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature interim results are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for the full year   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities these estimates and judgments are based on historical information information that is currently available to the company and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and shortterm investments with original maturities of less than  days cash equivalents are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and are primarily in money market funds the carrying value of those investments approximates fair value   earnings loss per share basic

liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of income and comprehensive income in the period that includes the enactment date                  index the company adopted section  of the fasb accounting standards codification “section ” with regards to uncertainty income taxes  section  addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements  under section  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position  the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement section  also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and requires
