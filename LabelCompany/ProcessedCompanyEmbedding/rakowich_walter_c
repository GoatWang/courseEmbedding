story mr rakowich  is the chief executive of prologis a real estate investment trust that operates warehouses and distribution centers around the world most of its domestic facilities are concentrated in six hubs one is the new jersey region which includes about  prologis buildings and roughly  million square feet of space q it’s been a year since your appointment as ceo what are your biggest accomplishments a i’d say there are three thingsfirst we wanted to deleverage the company second we wanted to derisk the operations and we’ve made substantial strides in leasing up our development pipeline it was  percent leased going into the year and is now  percent and third we wanted to rightsize the overhead of the company so we cut the g  a — general and administrative expenses — by about  percent our focus was to stabilize the company financially and i think we’ve accomplished a lotq one of the biggest issues facing prologis was its high debt load where does it stand today a our debt picture at the end of last year was about  billion and we’ve reduced that to  billion in a year so over  billion or almost  percent of our debt has been taken out of the pictureq how did you manage that a we sold about  billion of assets used the proceeds to pay down debt we did an equity offering that generated  billion and then we were able to buy back some bonds cheaply advertisement continue reading the main story q is there any more work to do in that regard a over time we’ll see asset values increase so you naturally deleverage when asset values rise asset values last year went down  percent and moving forward we think values have bottomed we’ve also taken care of most of our debt maturities through  continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story q let’s shift to the new jersey distribution hub has new jersey fared better than other states a no actually in the last three years it’s been worse in general there were customers that were moving out of new jersey and distributing more broadly from pennsylvania and i think that hurt occupancies but today i think it’s about the same as we see throughout the united states photo walter c rakowich credit katie orlinsky for the new york times q where are occupancy levels a that region is probably in the neighborhood of about  to  percent occupied our overall portfolio is about  percent leased but that includes europe asia and the like it’s down  to  percent from a year agoq where does new jersey rank in terms of traffica the port of los angeleslong beach is actually the busiest because of

in the us where we may see some opportunity in the next year to  months is on the acquisition front because property values have fallen but eventually the new development market will be back and when it is we’ll be building at exit a in new jersey down by princeton where we have a lot of landq are you developing anywhere in the world a in  we did somewhere in the neighborhood of  million of new development — almost all outside the united states we’re building several buildings in europe now and we’re building two buildings in japanq prologis has had an interest in sustainable development tell me about some green features a the buildings that we build save on water usage and have skylights that allow for more natural lightingwe’re also putting solar panels on our roofs we own throughout the world about  football fields of space — that’s  million square feet — and that’s a lot of roof area we’re trying to turn that roof area into an asset that is not only good for shareholders — ie generates rent — but also is good for the environment solar generates energy that we then sell into the grid and the utility will lease the roof space from usq you’ve been in denver
