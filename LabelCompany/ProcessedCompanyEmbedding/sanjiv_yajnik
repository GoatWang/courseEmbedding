november appointed him chairman of the texas economic development corp the corporation supports programs and activities of the governor’s division of economic development and tourism including texasone which markets texas to businesses outside the state enlarge sanjiv yajnik president of financial services and head of the plano campus for capital… more jake dean he also is chairman of the board of collin county business alliance which he helped create in  with the goal of making the county a better place to live and work i got to spend a morning with yajnik on the sprawling capital one campus when i profiled him for the power players feature in this week’s print edition which is devoted to coverage of economic development and corporate relocation and expansion heres some bonus coverage from that interview why is a separate business alliance for collin county necessary if you just think about collin county we have so many cities each city is trying to maximize itself but there isn’t a business interest that spans all across it and even though we for example are in plano our employees live all across the county so we are interested in what happens across the county what’s the annual budget of ccba it varies it depends on what it is that we do because we are a private group that’s not something that we release how do you fulfill the mission of the texas economic development council a variety of ways we will enable international trade visits we’ve had trade visits to mexico to cuba and we’re doing one to israel we will support our governor being able to meet up with the heads of state in those countries that will happen internationally we also have visits within the country so the governor may go to new york or california etc and meet up with groups of ceos or people who are thinking about expanding their businesses or relocating their businesses and we ensure that he’s got a great forum to do that we also go to trade shows where economic development professionals get together trying to find places for their clients to locate their companies we’re also involved in marketing to spread our story then finally we play an important role in getting businesses across texas who really want to help on this mission to get engaged in a powerful way were you a member of the texas economic development corp before being appointed chairman no it is not a position that i was seeking i have my hands full it was kind of a reluctant acceptance but i was humbled by the governor asking me to do it and frankly the reason that i’m doing that is because i love texas and i want to give back does the board vote on state incentives no we keep an arms length from that the incentive packages are put together on the state level by an office that the governor has for economic development and tourism that’s separate they handle it at the state level and then there are local incentives that are done by the local economic development corporations do you think north texas has the right balance of cooperation and competition in the way that regional organizations and individual cities try to recruit corporations considering relocating here competition is always good it helps us get better in the business world the market really helps us get better and get stronger so we are not resting on our successes of yesterday however a certain degree of coordination is awesome because at the end of the day coordination prevents waste too much coordination or too much centralization snuffs out the human spirit in trying to find that balance one of our roles in tedc is to bring parties together so that they can see the full picture of what’s going on but then allow people to do what is right for their local region what do you see as the single biggest threat to the jobs machine the economic development that’s drawing so many companies to north texas longterm economic prosperity starts with the premise that past success does not equal future success we have to be really careful about that the other thing i would say is the world is changing fast sometimes we don’t even realize how fast it is changing i believe that the greatest threat to texas and therefore the greatest opportunity for texas is to be the place that talent wants to come that is going to determine the next level of development of things that we do incredibly well at what concerns keep you awake at night related to economic development we need to be going to where the puck is going to be and not where it was this is a whole arena of where technologies meets industries and we want texas to be the place where everyone wants to be because of that i know that is happening but are we doing enough to make sure we are staying ahead of the curve on the capital one side what keeps you awake what keeps me awake on the capital one side is excitement we are the leading edge of technology and the success that we are enjoying here on the campus is because of many moves that we made over the years to stay ahead of the curve related content related content he reminds businesses you dont miss with texas state economic leaders weigh in on state of
