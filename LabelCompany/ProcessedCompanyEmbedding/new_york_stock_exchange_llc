the exchanges web site at wwwnysecom at the principal office of the exchange and at the commissions public reference room ii selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the selfregulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant parts of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the exchange proposes to amend the colocation  services offered by the exchange to a provide users  with access to two additional third party systems connectivity to six additional third party data feeds and connectivity to two additional third party testing feeds and b remove a duplicative third party data feed in addition the exchange proposes to make the corresponding changes to the exchanges price list related to these colocation services as set forth in the price list the exchange charges fees for connectivity to the execution systems of third party markets and other content service providers “third party systems” data feeds from third party markets and other content service providers “third party data feeds” and third party testing feeds the lists of third party systems and third party data feeds are set forth in the price list the exchange now proposes to make the following changes add two content service providers to the list of third party systems euronext optiq cash and derivatives unicast eua and euronext optiq cash and derivatives unicast production together the “additional third party systems” or “atps” add six feeds to the list of third party data feeds ○ euronext optiq compressed cash euronext optiq compressed derivatives euronext optiq shaped cash and euronext optiq shaped derivatives together the “additional euronext third party data feeds” and ○ cme group “cme” and international securities exchange “ise” together with the additional euronext third party data feeds the “additional third party data feeds” or “atpd” and add two new testing feeds euronext optiq cash eua and the euronext optiq derivatives eua and remove the euronext third party data feed the “current euronext feed” from the list of third party data feeds because the current euronext start printed page feed is similar to the euronext optiq compressed derivatives feed that the exchange now proposes to add as a third party data feed the proposed additional third party systems additional euronext third party data feeds and new testing feeds are new services and products from the third party content service provider euronext nv collectively the “euronext products” euronext nv “euronext” is expected to make the euronext products available no later than september   the exchange would provide access to the additional third party systems “access” and connectivity to the additional third party data feeds and new testing feeds “connectivity” as conveniences to users use of access or connectivity would be completely voluntary the exchange is not aware of any impediment to third parties offering access or connectivity because the euronext products are not yet available the exchange does not know whether third parties will offer users access and connectivity options to connect to the euronext products similarly the exchange does not have visibility into whether third parties currently offer or intend to offer users connectivity to the cme and ise additional third party data feeds as such third parties are not required to make that information public however if one or more third parties opt to offer or in the case of the cme and ise additional third party data feeds presently offer such access and connectivity to users a user may opt to access or connect to such services and products through a connection to an exchange access center outside the data center through another user a third party access center or a third party vendor in such a case depending on the service offered by the third party the user would be able to make such connection through the exchanges secure financial transaction infrastructure “sfti” network through a third party telecommunication provider third party wireless network or a combination thereof the proposed rule change relating to the cme and ise additional third party data feeds would become operative upon the effectiveness of the present rule filing the proposed rule change relating to each euronext product would become operative when such euronext product became available from euronext which is expected to be no later than september   but may not be at the same time for each euronext product the exchange will announce the dates that each euronext product will be available through customer notices disseminated to all users simultaneously connectivity to additional third party systems the exchange proposes to revise the price list to provide that users may obtain connectivity to the two additional third party systems for a fee as with the current third party systems users would connect to the additional third party systems over the internet protocol “ip” network a local area network available in the data center as with the current third party systems in order to obtain access to an additional third party system the user would enter into an agreement with the relevant third party content service provider pursuant to which the third party content service provider would charge the user for access to the additional third party system the exchange would then establish a unicast connection between the user and the relevant third party content service provider over the ip network the exchange would charge the user for the connectivity to the additional third party system a user would only receive and only be charged for access to additional third party systems for which it enters into agreements with the third party content service provider the exchange has no ownership interest in the additional third party systems establishing a users access to an additional third party system would not give the exchange any right to use the additional third party systems connectivity to an additional third party system would not provide access or order entry to the exchanges execution system and a users connection to an additional third party system would not be through the exchanges execution system the exchange proposes to charge a monthly recurring fee for connectivity to an additional third party system specifically when a user requests access to an additional third party system it would identify the applicable content service provider and what bandwidth connection it required the exchange proposes to modify its price list to add the additional third party systems to its existing list of third party systems the revised table would be as follows third party systemsamericas

productioninternational securities exchange isenasdaqnyfix marketplace the exchange does not propose to change the monthly recurring fee the exchange charges users for unicast connectivity to each third party system including the additional third party systems connectivity to additional third party data feeds the exchange proposes to revise the price list to provide that users may obtain connectivity to each of the six additional third party data feeds for a fee the exchange would receive the additional third party data feeds from the content service provider at its data center it would then provide connectivity to that data to users for a fee users would connect to the additional third party data feeds over the ip network with respect to the additional euronext third party data feeds the exchange proposes to offer connectivity to both “compressed” and “shaped” data feeds the exchange expects that euronexts shaped feeds will include more data than the compressed feeds in order to connect to an additional third party data feed a user would enter into a contract with the content service provider pursuant to which the content service provider would charge the user for the third party data feed the exchange would receive the third party data feed over its fiber optic network and after the content service start printed page provider and user entered into the contract and the exchange received authorization from the content service provider the exchange would retransmit the data to the user over the users port the exchange would charge the user for the connectivity to the additional third party data feed a user would only receive and would only be charged for connectivity to the additional third party data feeds for which it entered into contracts the exchange has no affiliation with the sellers of the additional third party data feeds it would have no right to use the additional third party data feeds other than as a redistributor of the data the additional third party data feeds would not provide access or order entry to the exchanges execution system the additional third party data feeds would not provide access or order entry to the execution systems of the third parties generating the feed the exchange would receive the additional third party data feeds via armslength agreements and it would have no inherent advantage over any other distributor of such data as it does with the existing third party data feeds the exchange proposes to charge a monthly recurring fee for connectivity to each additional third party data feed the monthly recurring fee would be per additional third party data feed depending on its needs and bandwidth a user may opt to receive all or some of the feeds or services included in an additional third party data feed the exchange proposes to add the connectivity fees for the additional third party data to its existing list in the price list the additional items would be as follows third party data

derivativesinternational securities exchange ise in addition the exchange proposes to remove the current euronext feed from the list of third party data feeds when the proposed euronext optiq compressed derivatives third party data feed is available the exchange understands that the proposed euronext optiq compressed derivatives third party data feed is a similar platform to the current euronext feed the proposed euronext optiq compressed derivatives data feed will be offered at the same price as the current euronext feed a user of the current euronext feed that wishes to continue to receive such data would enter into a contract with the content service provider to purchase the proposed euronext optiq compressed derivatives data feed when available the exchange will not cease to offer connectivity to the current euronext feed until the euronext optiq compressed derivatives data feed is available connectivity to third party testing and certification feeds the exchange offers users connectivity to third party certification and testing feeds certification feeds are used to certify that a user conforms to any of the relevant content service providers requirements for accessing third party systems or receiving third party data while testing feeds provide users an environment in which to conduct tests with nonlive data such feeds which are solely used for certification and testing and do not carry live production data are available over the ip network the exchange charges a connectivity fee of  per month per third party certification and testing feed the exchange proposes to offer users connectivity to the euronext optiq cash eua and the euronext optiq derivatives eua testing data feeds for the same connectivity fee of  per month per feed general as is the case with all exchange colocation arrangements i neither a user nor any of the users customers would be permitted to submit orders directly to the exchange unless such user or customer is a member organization a sponsored participant or an agent thereof eg a service bureau providing order entry services ii use of the colocation services proposed herein would be completely voluntary and available to all users on a nondiscriminatory basis  and iii a user would only incur one charge for the particular colocation service described herein regardless of whether the user connects only to the exchange or to the exchange and one or both the affiliate sros the proposed change is not otherwise intended to address any other issues relating to colocation services andor related fees and the exchange is not aware of any problems that users would have in complying with the proposed change  statutory basis the exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section b of the act in general and furthers the objectives of sections b of the act in particular because it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices to promote just and equitable principles of trade to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating clearing settling processing information with respect to and facilitating transactions in securities to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest and because it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers issuers brokers or dealers the exchange believes that the proposed changes would remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and in general protect investors and the public interest because by offering additional services the exchange would give each user additional options for addressing its access and connectivity needs responding to user demand for access and connectivity options providing additional services would help each user tailor its data center operations to the requirements of its business operations by allowing it to select the form and latency of access and connectivity that best suits its needs the exchange would provide access and connectivity as conveniences to users use of access or connectivity would be completely voluntary the exchange is not aware of any impediment to third parties offering access or connectivity because the start printed page euronext products are not yet available the exchange does not know whether third parties will offer users access and connectivity options to connect to the euronext products similarly the exchange does not have visibility into whether third parties currently offer or intend to offer users connectivity to the cme and ise additional third party data feeds however if one or more third parties opt to offer or in the case of the cme and ise additional third party data feeds presently offer such access and connectivity to users a user may opt to access or connect to such services and products through a connection to an exchange access center outside the data center through another user a third party access center or a third party vendor in such a case the user potentially would be able to make such connection through the exchanges sfti network through a third party telecommunication provider third party wireless network or a combination thereof the exchange believes that the proposed changes would remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and in general protect investors and the public interest because by offering connectivity to each of the euronext products as they come into production by euronext and offering connectivity to the cme and ise data feeds to users upon the effective date of this filing the exchange would give users additional options for connectivity and access to new services as soon as they are available responding to user demand for access and connectivity options the exchange believes that the proposed changes would remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and in general protect investors and the public interest because the exchange proposes not to remove the current euronext feed from the list of third party data feeds until the proposed euronext optiq compressed derivatives third party data feed is available the proposed euronext optiq compressed derivatives data feed will be offered to users at the same price at the current euronext feed and the exchange understands that the proposed euronext optiq compressed derivatives data feed is a similar platform to the current euronext feed all users whether or not they currently subscribe to the current euronext feed will have the opportunity to enter into a contract with euronext to purchase the proposed euronext optiq compressed derivatives data feed when available the exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section b of the act in particular because it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues fees and other charges among its members issuers and other persons using its facilities and does not unfairly discriminate between customers issuers brokers or dealers the exchange believes that the proposed fee changes are consistent with section b of the act for multiple reasons the exchange operates in a highly competitive market in which exchanges offer colocation services as a means to facilitate the trading and other market activities of those market participants who believe that colocation enhances the efficiency of their operations accordingly fees charged for colocation services are constrained by the active competition for the order flow of and other business from such market participants if a particular exchange charges excessive fees for colocation services affected market participants will opt to terminate their colocation arrangements with that exchange and adopt a possible range of alternative strategies including placing their servers in a physically proximate location outside the exchanges data center which could be a competing exchange or pursuing strategies less dependent upon the lower exchangetoparticipant latency associated with colocation accordingly the exchange charging excessive fees would stand to lose not only colocation revenues but also the liquidity of the formerly colocated trading firms which could have additional followon effects on the market share and revenue of the affected exchange the exchange believes that the additional services and fees proposed herein would be equitably allocated and not unfairly discriminatory because in addition to the services being completely voluntary they would be available to all users on an equal basis ie the same products and services would be available to all users all users that voluntarily selected to receive access or connectivity would be charged the same amount for the same services users that opted to use access or connectivity would not receive access or connectivity that is not available to all users as all market participants that contracted with the relevant market or content provider would receive access or connectivity the exchange believes that the proposed charges would be reasonable equitably allocated and not unfairly discriminatory because the exchange would offer the access and connectivity as conveniences to users but in order to do so must provide maintain and operate the data center facility hardware and technology infrastructure the exchange must handle the installation administration monitoring support and maintenance of such services including by responding to any production issues since the inception of colocation the exchange has made numerous improvements to the network hardware and technology infrastructure and has established additional administrative controls the exchange has expanded the network infrastructure to keep pace with the increased number of services available to users including resilient and redundant feeds in addition in order to provide access and connectivity the exchange would maintain multiple connections to each atpd and atps allowing the exchange to provide resilient and redundant connections adapt to any changes made by the relevant third party and cover any applicable fees charged by the relevant third party such as port fees in addition users would not be required to use any of their bandwidth for access and connectivity unless they wish to do so the exchange believes the proposed fees for connectivity to the atpd would be reasonable because they would allow the exchange to defray or cover the costs associated with offering users connectivity to atpd while providing users the convenience of receiving such atpd within colocation helping them tailor their data center operations to the requirements of their business operations in regards to the additional euronext third party data feeds the exchange expects that the shaped feeds will include more data than the compressed feeds the exchange accordingly believes that the proposed fees for the compressed and shaped data feeds for both the new euronext cash and new euronext derivatives services are reasonable because they would allow the exchange to defray or cover the costs associated with offering such connectivity including the maintenance and operating costs associated with the transatlantic euronext data feeds while providing users the benefit of receiving such additional euronext third party data feeds within colocation helping them tailor their data center operations to the requirements of their business operations by allowing them to select the form and latency of connectivity that best suits their needs including by selecting between shaped and compressed formatsstart printed page  the exchange believes that the addition of the two new euronext testing feeds for the same price as the monthly connectivity fees currently charged for other third party testing and certification feeds offered by the exchange would be reasonable equitably allocated and not unfairly discriminatory because it would provide users with the benefit of having an environment in which to conduct tests with nonlive data including testing for upcoming releases and product enhancements or the users own software development for the reasons above the proposed changes would not unfairly discriminate between or among market participants that are otherwise capable of satisfying any applicable colocation fees requirements terms and conditions established from time to time by the exchange for these reasons the exchange believes that the proposal is consistent with the act b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition in accordance with section b of the act the exchange believes that the proposed rule change will not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act because in addition to the proposed services being completely voluntary they are available to all users on an equal basis ie the same products and services are available to all users the exchange believes that providing users with additional options for connectivity and access to new services when available would not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act because such proposed access and connectivity would satisfy user demand for access and connectivity options the exchange would provide access and connectivity as conveniences equally to all users because the euronext products are not yet available the exchange does not know whether third parties will offer users access and connectivity options to connect to the euronext products similarly the exchange does not have visibility into whether third parties currently offer or intend to offer users connectivity to the cme and ise additional third party data feeds as such third parties are not required to make that information public however if one or more third parties opt to offer or in the case of the cme and ise additional third party data feeds presently offer such access and connectivity to users a user may opt to access or connect to such services and products through a connection to an exchange access center outside the data center through another user a third party access center or a third party vendor in such a case depending on the service offered by the third party the user would be able to make such connection through the sfti network through a third party telecommunication provider third party wireless network or a combination thereof users that opt to use the proposed access or connectivity would not receive access or connectivity that is not available to all users as all market participants that contract with the content provider may receive access or connectivity in this way the proposed changes would enhance competition by helping users tailor their access and connectivity to the needs of their business operations by allowing them to select the form and latency of access and connectivity that best suits their needs in addition the exchange believes that providing users with connectivity to each of the euronext products as they become available would not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act because such proposed access and connectivity would satisfy user demand for additional options for connectivity and access to new services by providing them as soon as euronext makes them available responding to user demand for access and connectivity options the exchange operates in a highly competitive market in which exchanges offer colocation services as a means to facilitate the trading and other market activities of those market participants who believe that colocation enhances the efficiency of their operations accordingly fees charged for colocation services are constrained by the active competition for the order flow of and other business from

adopt a possible range of alternative strategies including placing their servers in a physically proximate location outside the exchanges data center which could be a competing exchange or pursuing

also the liquidity of the formerly colocated trading firms which could have additional followon effects on the market share and revenue of the affected exchange for the reasons described above the exchange believes that the proposed rule change reflects this competitive environment c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others no written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change iii date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change and timing for commission action because the foregoing proposed rule change does not i significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest ii impose any significant burden on competition and iii become operative for  days from the date on which it was filed or such shorter time as the commission may designate it has become effective pursuant to section baiii of the act  and subparagraph f of rule b thereunder a proposed rule change filed under rule bf normally does not become operative prior to  days after the date of filing rule bfiii however permits the commission to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest the exchange has asked the commission to waive the day operative delay so that the proposal may become operative immediately upon filing the exchange states that waiver of the operative delay will permit users to obtain the benefits of the proposed new access and connectivity services and help users tailor their data center operations to the requirements of their business operations without delay the commission believes that waiving the day operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest therefore the commission hereby waives the operative delay and designates the start printed page proposed rule change operative upon filing at any time within  days of the filing of such proposed rule change the commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest for the protection of investors or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the act if the commission takes such action the commission shall institute proceedings under section bb  of the act to

seventeen members—fifteen directors plus the chairman and the ceo of the fifteen directors nine to be designated by deutsche boerse and six by nyse euronext current nyse euronext ceo duncan niederauer would assume the same role with the newly founded company and would lead an executive committee with an equal number of current deutsche boerse and nyse euronext executives on july   nyse euronext shareholders voted in favor of the merger and on july   deutsche boerse shareholders approved the deal as well these decisions move the two sides closer to completing the transaction which must still pass through forty separate regulatory approval processes to be finalized the merger was subject to review in both the united states and with the european union eu for concerns it could create a “de facto monopoly” in october  ceo niederauer said the company had received the eus socalled statement of objections which was more than  pages long and would be responding within two weeks possibly by asking for the opportunity for an oral hearing with the regulators the eu examination of the proposal formally began june  has said its expanded probe has a dec  deadline in march joaquin almunia the eus antitrust commissioner expressed concern that the deal would maybe monopolize the derivatives market due to deutsche boerses “vertical silo” which routes all trade clearing through its own services almunia said then he preferred a “more open business model” for markets on december   deutsche boerse won us antitrust approval to buy nyse euronext on condition that a deutsche boerse subsidiary the international securities exchange divest its  percent interest in direct edge nyse euronext and deutsche boerse ag delayed the deadline for completing their merger until march   so the exchange operators could try to persuade european regulators to approve the deal on february   the european union blocked the planned merger between nyse euronext and deutsche boerse the european commission—the eus executive body—ruled against the merger because they said the combined exchange would control more than  of the trade in european derivatives the european commission report stated the merger between deutsche boerse and nyse euronext would have led to a nearmonopoly in european financial derivatives worldwide these markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole european economy that they remain competitive on february   the nyse euronext and deutsche börse agreed with strong opposition by the eu for the planned merger to scrap the

powerhouse the shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal a successful deal would see the new company becoming the worlds largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalization of listed companies equal to  trillion the proposed group would have dual headquarters in deutsche boerses newly built green tower near frankfurt germany and in new york city at  wall street it would be led by a board with seventeen members—fifteen directors plus the chairman and the ceo of the fifteen directors nine to be designated by deutsche boerse and six by nyse euronext current nyse euronext ceo duncan niederauer would assume the same role with the newly founded company and would lead an executive committee with an equal number of current deutsche boerse and nyse euronext executives on july   nyse euronext shareholders voted in favor of the merger and on july   deutsche boerse shareholders approved the deal as well these decisions move the two sides closer to completing the transaction which must still pass through forty separate regulatory approval processes to be finalized the merger was subject to review in both the united states and with the european union eu for concerns it could create a “de facto monopoly” in october  ceo niederauer said the company had received the eus socalled statement of objections which was more than  pages long and would be responding within two weeks possibly by asking for the opportunity for an oral hearing with the regulators the eu examination of the proposal formally began june  has said its expanded probe has a dec  deadline in march joaquin almunia the eus antitrust commissioner expressed concern that the deal would maybe monopolize the derivatives

börseedit in  bloomberg reported that the german exchange operator deutsche börse was in advanced talks to buy nyse euronext for  billion in a deal that would create the worlds largest trading powerhouse the shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal a successful deal would see the new company becoming the worlds largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalization of listed companies equal to  trillion the proposed group would have dual headquarters in deutsche boerses newly built green tower near frankfurt germany and in new york city at  wall street it would be led by a board with seventeen members—fifteen directors plus the chairman and the ceo of the fifteen directors nine to be designated by deutsche boerse and six by nyse euronext current nyse euronext ceo duncan niederauer would assume the same role with the newly founded company and would lead an executive committee with an equal number of current deutsche boerse and nyse euronext executives on july   nyse euronext shareholders voted in favor of the merger and on july   deutsche boerse shareholders approved the deal as well these decisions move the two sides closer to completing the transaction which must still pass through forty separate regulatory approval processes to be finalized the merger was subject to review in both the united states and with the european union eu for concerns it could create a “de facto monopoly” in october  ceo niederauer said the company had received the eus socalled statement of objections which was more than  pages long and would be responding within two weeks possibly by asking for the opportunity for an oral hearing with the regulators the eu examination of the proposal formally began june  has said its expanded probe has a dec  deadline in march joaquin almunia the eus antitrust commissioner expressed concern that the deal would maybe monopolize the derivatives market due to deutsche boerses “vertical silo” which routes all trade clearing through its own services almunia said then he preferred a “more open business model” for markets on december   deutsche boerse won us antitrust approval to buy nyse euronext on condition that a deutsche boerse subsidiary the international securities exchange divest its  percent interest in direct edge nyse euronext and deutsche boerse ag delayed the deadline for completing their merger until march   so the exchange operators could try to persuade european regulators to approve the deal on february   the european union blocked the planned merger between nyse euronext and deutsche boerse the european commission—the eus executive body—ruled against the merger because they said the combined exchange would control more than  of the trade in european derivatives the european commission report stated the merger between deutsche boerse and nyse euronext would have led to a nearmonopoly in european financial derivatives worldwide these markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole european economy that they remain competitive on february   the nyse euronext and deutsche

börseedit in  bloomberg reported that the german exchange operator deutsche börse was in advanced talks to buy nyse euronext for  billion in a deal that would create the worlds largest trading powerhouse the shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal a successful deal would see the new company becoming the worlds largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalization of listed companies equal to  trillion the proposed group would have dual headquarters in deutsche boerses newly built green tower near frankfurt germany and in new york city at  wall street it would be led by a board with seventeen members—fifteen directors plus the chairman and the ceo of the fifteen directors nine to be designated by deutsche boerse and six by nyse euronext current nyse euronext ceo duncan niederauer would assume the same role with the newly founded company and would lead an executive committee with an equal number of current deutsche boerse and nyse euronext executives on july   nyse euronext shareholders voted in favor of the merger and on july   deutsche boerse shareholders approved the deal as well these decisions move the two sides closer to completing the transaction which must still pass through forty separate regulatory approval processes to be finalized the merger was subject to review in both the united states and with the european union eu for concerns it could create a “de facto monopoly” in october  ceo niederauer said the company had received the eus socalled statement of objections which was more than  pages long and would be responding within two weeks possibly by asking for the opportunity for an oral hearing with the regulators the eu examination of the proposal formally began june  has said its expanded probe has a dec  deadline in march joaquin almunia the eus antitrust commissioner expressed concern that the deal would maybe monopolize the derivatives market due to deutsche boerses “vertical silo” which routes all trade clearing through its own services almunia said then he preferred a “more open business model” for markets on december   deutsche boerse won us antitrust approval to buy nyse euronext on condition that a deutsche boerse subsidiary the international securities exchange divest its  percent interest in direct edge nyse euronext and deutsche boerse ag delayed the deadline for completing their merger until march   so the exchange operators could try to persuade european regulators to approve the deal on february   the european union blocked the planned merger between nyse euronext and deutsche boerse the european commission—the eus executive body—ruled against the merger because they said the combined exchange would control more than  of the trade in european derivatives the european commission report stated the merger between deutsche boerse and nyse euronext would have led to a nearmonopoly in european financial derivatives worldwide these markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole european economy that they remain competitive on february   the nyse euronext and deutsche

börseedit in  bloomberg reported that the german exchange operator deutsche börse was in advanced talks to buy nyse euronext for  billion in a deal that would create the worlds largest trading powerhouse the shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal a successful deal would see the new company becoming the worlds largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalization of listed companies equal to  trillion the proposed group would have dual headquarters in deutsche boerses newly built green tower near frankfurt germany and in new york city at  wall street it would be led by a board with seventeen members—fifteen directors plus the chairman and the ceo of the fifteen directors nine to be designated by deutsche boerse and six by nyse euronext current nyse euronext ceo duncan niederauer would assume the same role with the newly founded company and would lead an executive committee with an equal number of current deutsche boerse and nyse euronext executives on july   nyse euronext shareholders voted in favor of the merger and on july   deutsche boerse shareholders approved the deal as well these decisions move the two sides closer to completing the transaction which must still pass through forty separate regulatory approval processes to be finalized the merger was subject to review in both the united states and with the european union eu for concerns it could create a “de facto monopoly” in october  ceo niederauer said the company had received the eus socalled statement of objections which was more than  pages long and would be responding within two weeks possibly by asking for the opportunity for an oral hearing with the regulators the eu examination of the proposal formally began june  has said its expanded probe has a dec  deadline in march joaquin almunia the eus antitrust commissioner expressed concern that the deal would maybe monopolize the derivatives market due to deutsche boerses “vertical silo” which routes all trade clearing through its own services almunia said then he preferred a “more open business model” for markets on december   deutsche boerse won us antitrust approval to buy nyse euronext on condition that a deutsche boerse subsidiary the international securities exchange divest its  percent interest in direct edge nyse euronext and deutsche boerse ag delayed the deadline for completing their merger until march   so the exchange operators could try to persuade european regulators to approve the deal on february   the european union blocked the planned merger between nyse euronext and deutsche boerse the european commission—the eus executive body—ruled against the merger because they said the combined exchange would control more than  of the trade in european derivatives the european commission report stated the merger between deutsche boerse and nyse euronext would have led to a nearmonopoly in european financial derivatives worldwide these markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole european economy that they remain competitive on february   the nyse euronext and deutsche börse agreed with strong opposition by the eu for the planned merger to scrap the merger intercontinentalexchange acquisition of nyse euronextedit on december   the boards of directors of both
