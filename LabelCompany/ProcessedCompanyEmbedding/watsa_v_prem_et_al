resetaa font size print superior court of connecticut capgrowth partners et al v v prem watsa et al fstcvs     decided october   memorandum of decision re plaintiffs application for a temporary restraining order expedited discovery and temporary injunctionthis court conducted a hearing based on the papers without any witnesses testifying   the plaintiffs seek to restrain and enjoin a negotiated tender offer that is scheduled to close on october     the offer is the culmination of a transaction that was announced on september     the offer price represents approximately a  premium over the preannouncement market price for shares of odyssey re common stock   the offer provides an opportunity for the odyssey re shareholders that plaintiff represents in this class action to receive more than one billion dollars in cash   the plaintiff asked the court for expedited injunctive relief to block the tender offer from proceedingfairfax investments usa corp is a delaware corporation and a whollyowned subsidiary of fairfax financial holdings limited   odyssey re a delaware corporation was formed through the combination of businesses acquired by fairfax in  and    fairfax has maintained majority ownership of odyssey res shares since odyssey res initial public offer in    fairfax and its subsidiaries own approximately  of the outstanding odyssey re common stockduring the week of august   fairfax approached the members of odyssey res board of directors to state its interest in exploring a potential acquisition   discussions and negotiations followed   on september  and   the legal and financial advisors for fairfax and odyssey re engaged in negotiations with the members of the special committee   on september   fairfax agreed to increase its offer to  per share which fairfax stated was its best and final offer   on the morning of september   the special committee unanimously agreed to recommend that odysseys board of directors recommend that shareholders accept fairfaxs offer of  per share   the necessary approvals were obtained   the tender offer was commenced on september     on september   odyssey re filed the recommendation statement with the securities and exchange commission “sec” in connection with the tender offer and merger agreement   the tender offer is scheduled to close on october  the law in connecticut is clear that a party seeking a temporary restraining order has the burden of proving  a likelihood of prevailing on the merits  lack of an adequate legal remedy  substantial probability of irreparable harm and  the balance of the equities favors a temporary restraining orderthis court finds that there are adequate legal remedies available to the plaintiff   a court will not grant injunctive relief if it appears from the complaint and the moving papers to a reasonable certainty that an award of money damages could fully and adequately compensate the plaintiffs for any injury they may suffer   a party seeking injunctive relief has the burden of alleging and proving irreparable harm and a lack of an adequate remedy   these elements are so crucial that a partys failure to allege and prove them is sufficient ground for sustaining the refusal to grant an injunction even where a courts conclusions on the merits are erroneous   the plaintiffs” papers confirm the availability of adequate legal remedies   the complaint affirmatively demands monetary damages not injunction relief   if plaintiff prevailed on its claims after trial an award of money damages would adequately compensate for any injuries it sufferedeven if the tender offer price was found to be inadequate at trial any unfairness is reflected in an unfair price for which there is a remedy of other than the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction   the plaintiffs have a remedy for the claim of inadequate consideration for its odyssey re shares under statutory appraisal rights under delaware law  del c §    in the absence of fraud selfdealing or gross overreaching stockholders cashed out in a merger can rely on the basic remedy of an appraisal under delaware lawthere is no irreparable harm   as with the availability of legal remedies the probability of irreparable harm depends on whether a plaintiff can be made whole by money damages   the plaintiff argues that odyssey re is being acquired on the cheap   the plaintiff has the option of seeking damages in a trial on its breach of duty claims or exercising its statutory appraisal rights or both   either a damages claim or an appraisal proceeding would provide a full and adequate remedy of the harm for which plaintiff seeks relief   the failure to demonstrate the probability of irreparable harm is fatal to the plaintiffs application for injunctive reliefin balancing the equities a court may consider and balance the injury complained of with that which will result with the interference by injunction   there would be significant harm to other minority shareholders   if the tender offer is enjoined by this court those shareholders will be deprived of their free choice to decide whether or not to sell and they will lose out on the approximate  premium and the approximate  billion in cash   thus the balance of the equities fall against the plaintiffthe connecticut law on the standard for granting expedited discovery is limited   delaware courts will grant expedited discovery only if a plaintiff can demonstrate both  a sufficiently colorable claim and  a sufficient possibility of a threatened irreparable harm   if a plaintiff cannot succeed in its request for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction expedited discovery is not justifiedin rendering this decision the court has taken into consideration the extensive briefs filed by both parties along with the cases attached thereto and the case of chalverus v bershad  wl  connsuperct aug   decided by judge aurigemma  conn l rptr for all of the foregoing reasons the plaintiffs request for a temporary restraining order expedited discovery and temporary injunction are deniedso orderededward r karazin jrsenior judgekarazin edward r jtr findlaw career
