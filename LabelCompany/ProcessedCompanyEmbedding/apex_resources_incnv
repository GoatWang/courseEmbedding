statements december     note  organization and basis of presentation   apex resources inc the “company” is a for profit corporation established under the corporation laws of the state of nevada on march     the primary focus of apex resources inc will be providing very high quality stream room products at competitive prices the company is a newly created company and is subject to all risks inherent to the establishment of a startup business enterprise the company’s operations are based in lithuania but use the us dollar as its functional currency   our financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and are expressed in us dollars the company’s fiscal yearend is june    the financial statements and related disclosures as of december   are reviewed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the united states securities and exchange commission “sec” unless the context otherwise requires all references to “apex” “apex resources” “we” “us” “our” or the “company” are to apex resources inc   note  significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements   use of estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period actual results could differ from those estimates   due to the limited level of operations the company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the company is a going concern   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents   fair value of financial instruments   asc  “disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments asc  “fair value measurements” defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of december     the respective carrying values of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximate their fair values these financial instruments include cash accrued liabilities and notes payable fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair value          apex resources inc notes to the condensed financial statements december     development stage entity   the company decided to early adopt asu  which eliminates the definition of a development stage entity eliminates the development stage presentation and disclosure requirements under asc  and amends provisions of existing variable interest entity guidance under asc    basic and diluted loss per share   the company computes earnings loss per share in accordance with asc  “earnings per share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net earnings loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted earnings loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period dilutive earnings loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive the company has no potential dilutive instruments and therefore basic and diluted earnings loss per share are equal   revenue recognition   the company follows the guidelines of asc  for revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all the following conditions have been met     a the customer has prepaid for the product         b the product has been shipped from either apex resources or one of our suppliers and         c the product has been delivered and signed for by the customer as evidenced by the shipping company   the company is the primary obligor in the sales transaction we are able to select suppliers based upon the customer’s needs we do not have a key supplier we have sales agreements with multiple suppliers and we are able to set the price of the product to the customer customers are allowed to return the products within  days for exchange or refund if defects in manufacturing are identified the company does not believe the  day exchange or refund will have a material impact on our revenue recognition as any product which has a defect in manufacturing will be returned to the supplier for replacement or refund for the customer based upon pursuant law and the uniform commercial code   based on the above the company determined that the revenue recognition for the sales is in accordance with the fasb asc    income taxes   we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  “income taxes” under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of i taxes payable or refundable for the current year and ii deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized          apex resources inc notes to the condensed financial statements december     asc topic  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return asc topic  provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition we have no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented   our effective tax rate for fiscal year  is  which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term our tax rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year   income taxes are calculated and accrued for us taxes only the company does not currently accrue any lithuanian taxes under lithuanian corporate rules as we become profitable and have sustained revenue within lithuania we may become subject to lithuanian taxes   recent accounting pronouncements   the financial accounting standards board “fasb” periodically issues new accounting standards in a continuing effort to improve standards of financial accounting and reporting the company has reviewed the recently issued pronouncements during this review the company decided to early adopt asu  which eliminates the definition of a development stage entity eliminates the development stage presentation and disclosure requirements under asc  and amends provisions of existing variable interest entity guidance under asc    on june   the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update no   development stage entities topic   elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including an amendment to variable interest entities guidance in topic  consolidation  which removes all incremental financial reporting requirements from gaap for development stage entities including the removal of topic  from the

entities the revised consolidation standards are effective one year later in annual periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted the company has adopted the amendment as of fiscal year ended june     there are several new accounting pronouncements issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” which are not yet effective each of these pronouncements as applicable has been or will be adopted by the company as of december   none of these pronouncements is expected to have a material effect on the financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company          apex resources inc notes to the condensed financial statements december     unaudited financial statements   the balance sheet as of december   the statements of operations and cash flows for the three month period ended december   have been prepared by the company without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america have been condensed or omitted as allowed by such rules and regulations and the company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading the results of operations for the three months ended december

fairly the financial position results of operations and changes in financial position at december   have been made   it is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the june   audited financial statements and the accompanying notes included in the company’s registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission   note  going concern   the accompanying financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern   for the period from inception march   to december  the company had a net profit loss of  the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company’s ability to generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably or raise additional capital through debt financing andor through sales of common stock   management plans to fund operations of the company through the proceeds from its recent offering pursuant to a registration statement on form s or private placements of restricted securities or the issuance of stock in lieu of cash for payment of services until such a time as profitable operations are achieved there are no written agreements in place for such funding or issuance of securities and there can be no assurance that such will be available in the future management believes that this plan provides an opportunity for the company to continue as a going concern   the failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability or obtain the additional funding would be detrimental to the company   note  concentrations   initial sales

depreciation expense for a net loss of    for the six months ended december   we generated  in revenues and  in cost of goods sold for a gross profit of  we incurred operating expenses of  consisting primarily of general expenses advertising and promotion and provision for income tax for a net loss of    plan of operation for the next  months   our cash balance is  as of december   our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations   even under a limited operations scenario to maintain our corporate existence we believe we will require a minimum of  in additional cash over the next  months to pay for the remainder of our total offering costs and to maintain our regulatory reporting and filings management believes the company will require a minimum of approximately  over the next twelve months to remain in business either from revenues or funding we currently have no arrangement in place to cover this shortfall   if we do not generate revenues these funds will have to be raised through equity financing debt financing or other sources which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares we will also require additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are ultimately not successful in earning revenues we currently do not have any arrangements regarding the offering or following the offering for further financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required obtaining commercial loans assuming those loans would be available will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments   there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations even if additional financing is available it may not be available on terms we find favorable at this time there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in place failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business   our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have generated  in revenues but no significant increase in revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development there is no assurance we will ever reach that stage to meet our need for cash we have raised money from an offering pursuant to a registration statement filed on form s however we were only able to raise half the amount we anticipated if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely          we have commenced development of our planned steam room products distribution business in the next twelve months we plan to engage in the following activities to expand our business operations              shares sold             gross proceeds from this offering        offering expenses       proceeds after offering expenses       legal accounting  filing       website development       marketing  advertising                 totals         during the first stages of our growth our director will provide all of the labor required to execute our business plan at no charge funds will come from cash on hand from revenues or loans from our director   our president will devote approximately  to  hours of his time to our operations once we begin operations and are able to attract more and more customers to buy our product he has agreed to commit more time as required because he will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him as a result operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a cessation of operations   our specific goal is to profitably sell our product our plan of operations is as follows   negotiation with potential customers distributors and brokers   months  we hope to negotiate agreements with national mediumsized wholesale and wholesale steam room distribution companies to date several mediumsized wholesale steam room distribution companies have expressed interest in our products we have contacted buyers from these companies and have engaged in discussion regarding supplying steam room distribution products also we sold to one of the steam room distribution firms we have no written agreements with any of them at the current time but we will be providing samples to several buyers in an attempt to secure contracts with these companies we have purchased samples which will be provided to our main prospects the cost of  was split between our offering proceeds and revenues as soon as we get approval from potential buyers the product will be shipped directly from manufacturer to the buyer or picked up and delivered from the supplier at one of their us representative locations        marketing   months  we plan to advertise through home improvement trade shows and a road show campaign at the stores of our future customers distributors and brokers we intend to develop and maintain a database of potential customers who may want to purchase steam room products from us we will follow up with these clients periodically send them our new catalogues and offer them presentations and special discounts from time to time we plan to print catalogues and flyers and mail them to potential customers we intend to use marketing strategies such as web advertisements direct mailing samples for main prospects and phone calls to acquire potential customers we intend to spend  on marketing efforts during the first year marketing is an ongoing matter that will continue during the life of our operations   development of our website   months  during this period we intend to further develop our website we may hire a web designer to help us with the design and basic development of our website if our director is unable to accomplish it we do not have any written agreements with any web designers at current time the basic website development cost is expected to be  updating and improving our website will continue throughout the lifetime of our operations   it is our plan that when we have enough money we want to start making and selling our own brand of steam room products steam rooms   for the current time our company is focused on getting our second and third customer and selling them more of the steam rooms i hope we can add second and third customer in the next  months   liquidity and capital resources   at december   the company had  in cash and there were outstanding liabilities of  our director has verbally agreed to continue to loan the company funds for operating expenses in a limited scenario but he has no legal obligation to do so   offbalance

policies and recent accounting pronouncements   use of estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period actual results could differ from those estimates   due to the limited level of operations the company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the company is a going concern   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents   fair value of financial instruments   asc  “disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments asc  “fair value measurements” defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands

stage presentation and disclosure requirements under asc  and amends provisions of existing variable interest entity guidance under asc    basic and diluted loss per share   the company computes earnings loss per share in accordance with asc  “earnings per share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net earnings loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted earnings loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period dilutive earnings loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive the company has no potential dilutive instruments and therefore basic and diluted earnings loss per share are equal   revenue recognition   the company follows the guidelines of asc  for revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all the following conditions have been met     a the customer has prepaid for the product   b the product has been shipped from either apex resources or one of our suppliers and   c the product has been delivered and signed for by the customer as evidenced by the shipping company   the company is the primary obligor in the sales transaction we are able to select suppliers based upon the customer’s needs we do not have a key supplier we have sales agreements with multiple suppliers and we are able to set the price of the product to the customer customers are allowed to return the products within  days for exchange or refund if defects in manufacturing are identified the company does not believe the  day exchange or refund will have a material impact on our revenue recognition as any product which has a defect in manufacturing will be returned to the supplier for replacement or refund for the customer based upon pursuant law and the uniform commercial code   based on the above the company determined that the revenue recognition for the sales is in accordance with the fasb asc    income taxes   we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  “income taxes” under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of i taxes payable or refundable for the current year and ii deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted

tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized            apex resources inc notes to the condensed

a continuing effort to improve standards of financial accounting and reporting the company has reviewed the recently issued pronouncements during this review the company decided to early adopt asu  which eliminates the definition of a development stage entity eliminates the development stage presentation and disclosure requirements under asc  and amends provisions of existing variable interest entity guidance under asc    on june   the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update no   development stage entities topic   elimination of certain financial

adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position results of operations and changes in financial position at march   have been made   it is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the june   audited financial statements and the accompanying notes included in the company’s registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission   note  going concern   the accompanying financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern   for the period from inception march   to march   the company had a net profit loss of  the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company’s ability to generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably or raise additional capital through debt financing andor through sales of common stock   management plans to fund operations of the company through the proceeds from its recent offering pursuant to a registration statement on form s or private placements of restricted securities or the issuance of stock in lieu of cash for payment of services until such a time as profitable operations are achieved there are no written agreements in place for such funding or issuance of securities and there can be no assurance that such will be available in the future management believes that this plan provides an opportunity for the company to continue as a going concern   the failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability or obtain the additional funding would be detrimental to the company   note

forwardlooking statements   this report contains forwardlooking statements which relate to future events or our future financial performance in some cases you can identify forwardlooking statements by terminology such as “may” “should” “expects” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “estimates” “predicts” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology these statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors including the risks in the section entitled “risk factors” that may cause our or our industry’s actual results levels of activity performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results levels of activity performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements   while these forwardlooking statements and any assumptions upon which they are based are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business actual results will almost always vary sometimes materially from any estimates predictions projections assumptions or other future performance suggested herein except as required by applicable law including the securities laws of the united states we do not intend to update any of the forwardlooking statements to conform these statements to actual results   results of operations   we have had  in operating revenues and  in cost of goods sold since our inception on march   through march   our activities have been financed from  in gross profits a loan of  from our sole officer and director to open the company bank accounts  from the sale of  shares of common stock to our director and  in proceeds from the sale of  shares at  per share to  independent shareholders pursuant to the company’s registration statement on form s   for the period from inception through march   we incurred operating expenses of  consisting primarily of advertising expenses professional fees and office expenses and recorded a provision for income tax of  for a net loss of    for the three months ended march   we generated  in revenues and  in cost of goods sold for a gross profit of  we incurred operating expenses of  consisting primarily of general expense and depreciation expense for a net loss of    for the three months ended march   we generated  in revenues and  in cost of goods

expenses advertising and promotion and provision for income tax for a net loss of    plan of operation for the next  months   our cash balance is  as of march   our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations   even under a limited operations scenario to maintain our corporate existence we believe we will require a minimum of  in additional cash over the next  months to pay for the remainder of our total offering costs and to maintain our regulatory reporting and filings management believes the company will require a minimum of approximately  over the next twelve months to remain in business either from revenues or funding we currently have no arrangement in place to cover this shortfall   if we do not generate revenues these funds will have to be raised through equity financing debt financing or other sources which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares we will also require additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are ultimately not successful in earning revenues we currently do not have any arrangements regarding the offering or following the offering for further financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required obtaining commercial loans assuming those loans would be available will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments   there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations even if additional financing is available it may not be available on terms we find favorable at this time there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in place failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business   our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have generated  in revenues but no significant increase in revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development there is no assurance we will ever reach that stage to meet our need for cash we have raised money from an offering pursuant to a registration statement filed on form s however we were only able to raise half the amount we anticipated if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely            we have commenced development of our planned steam room products distribution business in the next twelve months we plan to engage in the following activities to expand our business operations              shares sold             gross proceeds from this offering        offering expenses       proceeds after offering expenses       legal accounting  filing       website development       marketing  advertising                 totals         during the first stages of our growth our director will provide all of the labor required to execute our business plan at no charge funds will come from cash on hand from revenues or loans from our director   our president will devote approximately  to  hours of his time to our operations once we begin operations and are able to attract more and more customers to buy our product he has agreed to commit more time as required because he will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him as a result operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a cessation of operations   our specific goal is to profitably sell our product our plan of operations is as follows   negotiation with potential customers distributors and brokers   months  we hope to negotiate agreements with national mediumsized wholesale and wholesale steam room distribution companies to date several mediumsized wholesale steam room distribution companies have expressed interest in our products we have contacted buyers from these companies and have engaged in discussion regarding supplying steam room distribution products also we sold to one of the steam room distribution firms we have no written agreements with any of them at the current time but we will be providing samples to several buyers in an attempt to secure contracts with these companies we have purchased samples which will be provided to our main prospects the cost of  was split between our offering proceeds and revenues as soon as we get approval from potential buyers the product will be shipped directly from manufacturer to the buyer or picked up and delivered from the supplier at one of their us representative locations            marketing   months  we plan to advertise through home improvement trade shows and a road show campaign at the stores of our future customers distributors and brokers we intend to develop and maintain a database of potential customers who may want to purchase steam room products from us we will follow up with these clients periodically send them our new catalogues and offer them presentations and special discounts from time to time we plan to print catalogues and flyers and mail them to potential customers we intend to use marketing strategies such as web advertisements direct mailing samples for main prospects and phone calls to acquire potential customers we intend to spend  on marketing efforts during the first year marketing is an ongoing matter that will continue during the life of our operations   development of our website   months  during this period we intend to further develop our website we may hire a web designer to help us with the design and basic development of our website if our director is unable to accomplish it we do not have any written agreements with any web designers at current time the basic website development cost is expected to be  updating and improving our website will continue throughout the lifetime of our operations   it is our plan that when we have enough money we want to start making and selling our own brand of steam room products steam rooms   for the current time our company is focused on getting our second and third customer and selling them more of the steam rooms i hope we can add second and third customer in the next  months   liquidity and capital resources   at march   the company had  in cash and there were outstanding liabilities of  our director has
