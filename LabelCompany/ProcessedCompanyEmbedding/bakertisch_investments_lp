money in your bank account matters in the unlikely event your bank failswhile your deposits are insured for up to  by the federal deposit insurance corp or fdic that doesnt mean every account at a particular bank is covered for that amount the way you structure your accounts could put you at risk but there also are ways to set up accounts so youre insured for far more than a lot of consumers dont understand what the limits are says thomas healy deputy chief compliance officer at ally bank people think its  periodmastering your money make this the starting point on your money road mapwhat is fdic insurancesince it was established in  the fdic has provided insurance on your money in case your bank goes belly upthe insurance covers checking savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit or cds it also covers other types of accounts such as individual retirement accounts or iras and trust accountsall state and nationally chartered banks must carry the insurance says fdic spokeswoman lajuan williamsyoungwhy the government created the fdicon june   president franklin d roosevelt signed the banking act of  which established the fdic among other things the fdic was created in response to thousands of bank failures during the early years of the great depression that resulted in about  billion in losses to depositorsthe act was designed to raise the confidence of the us public in the banking system by alleviating the disruptions caused by bank failures and bank runs according to the fdicfdic insurance doesnt cover investment products such as mutual funds

healy saysconsumers need to keep in mind that their accounts are still subject to fdic limits even if they have accounts at different branches of the same bank healy says but if they have accounts at two different banks the insurance limits apply at each bank individually they arent lumped togethermore on insurance coveragethe fdic offers multiple ways for depositors to find out how to set up
