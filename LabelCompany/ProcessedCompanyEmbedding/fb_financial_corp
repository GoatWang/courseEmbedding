conduct our core banking operations primarily in tennessee and compete in the commercial banking industry solely through our whollyowned banking subsidiary firstbank the banking industry is highly competitive and we experience competition in our market areas from many other financial institutions we compete with commercial banks credit unions savings institutions mortgage banking firms online mortgage lenders consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market funds and other mutual funds as well as superregional national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our market areas and elsewhere in addition a number of outofstate financial intermediaries have opened production offices or otherwise solicit deposits in our market areas increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans and deposits as well as reduced net interest margin and profitability furthermore the tennessee market has grown increasingly competitive in recent years with a number of banks entering this market with a primary focus on the state’s metropolitan markets we believe this trend will continue as banks look to gain a foothold in this growing market this trend will result in greater competition primarily in our metropolitan markets however we firmly believe that our market position and clientfocused operating
