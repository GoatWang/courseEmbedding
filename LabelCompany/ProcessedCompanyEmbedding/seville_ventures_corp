our time refining our business plan we have identified and contacted several hotels restaurants airlines tour companies and more that we intend to feature in our luxury vacation packages to discuss our proposed business plan and the costs associated with including their products and services in our proposed vacation packages as of the date of this filing we have not entered into any negotiations or contracts with these companies during this early development stage we have secured the domain name for our first website located at wwwmyspanishgetawaycom which we hope will eventually become a reputable name and a valuable resource to our future clients as part of our growth strategy to offer luxury vacation packages throughout europe we have also secured multiple domain names for future websites that we intend to launch including wwwmyeuropeangetawaycom wwwmyitaliangetawaycom wwwmybritishgetawaycom and wwwmygreekgetawaycom eventually we intend to have wwwmyeuropeangetawaycom be our main domain under which all other domains will be linked plan of operations product launch and website development the first step in realizing our business plan is to make our proposed vacations available for purchase through our website wwwmyspanishgetawaycom currently our website is accessible online however our proposed vacations are not yet available for purchase online we intend to contract a website developer to enhance our existing website to allow a potential client to choose a travel package select different travel options or package features compare options interact with the company and design a customized vacation additionally the website developer will integrate an ecommerce platform into our website so that the company is able to securely accept credit card

securely transmit confidential information over the internet further the website developer will build a highly structured backend to our website to allow us to store details about clients and businesses that we intend to work with analyze and organize information and data optimize the performance of our website and more the website developer that we intend to hire will not be retained to diagnose or correct any technical problems delays or disruptions we may encounter with our current or future websites accordingly we would need to consult outside technicians to correct any problems we may experience which would cause the company to incur additional costs to date the company has not yet retained a website developer sales representative initially our sole officer and director will be responsible for arranging the details involved in each vacation package including booking airfare reserving the luxury hotel suites and dinner reservations arranging the tours and other entertainment and preparing detailed itineraries however as the company expands the company intends to hire a sales representative to perform these duties the sales representative will also be responsible for actively establishing relationships with the airlines hotels restaurants and other businesses whose products or services will be included in our vacation packages based on the feedback that we will receive from past clients who purchased our vacation packages if we determine that the features of our vacation packages are not of the highest quality or to the full satisfaction of the clients the sales representative will search for alternative products or services to include in our vacation packages as of the date of this filing we have not yet retained a sales representative we intend to hire a sales representative who is bilingual in both english and spanish to facilitate making travel arrangements in spain assist clients with any language barriers they may encounter in their travels and if and when we expand our business to better market our products and services to more diverse clients marketing we believe that we can build a trusted and recognizable brand through our luxury vacation packages and high quality services after we begin to offer our vacation packages for sale online through our first website we plan to hire a professional marketing firm to initiate and manage each objective of our marketing strategy as set forth herein and to advertise our brand throughout the united states and eventually overseas once we have initiated our marketing plan through a marketing firm we believe that a substantial portion of our clients will be acquired through wordofmouth raising awareness of our brand will be an ongoing process as we try to establish our company expand our services and products increase our clients and grow to new markets as of the date of this filing we have not yet retained a marketing firm to initiate our marketing strategy customer service representative following the initiation of our marketing strategy we intend to hire a customer service representative to assist clients with their travel needs before during and after their vacation getaways the customer service representative will provide services such as assisting clients with obtaining passports travelers insurance policies from an established insurance company or other travel needs mailing guidebooks and itineraries to clients before they depart and providing detailed information regarding the places hotels and restaurants that they will be visiting and more further the customer service representative will be available to our clients during their vacations via a tollfree telephone number or via email to assist clients with any problems that they may encounter to make alternative arrangements if necessary and generally assist the clients with what they may need or desire ongoing website development and maintenance we plan to devote a significant portion of our resources if any to the continued development and maintenance of our current and future websites to ensure high levels of performance and advanced security we further intend to devote a large portion of our resources to the development of advanced interactive features on our current and future websites to improve the experience we offer to potential clients we intend to employ an

clients to be able to search our websites for flights hotels restaurants and more based on their preferences ratings amenities location etc and to easily customize their vacation packages through a userfriendly interface we believe that as we make improvements in and advancements to our websites we will reduce our reliance on sales representatives to provide similar services additionally we intend to further develop our websites to increase the interactivity between clients and the company through live chat customer service and the creation of an online blog where potential and past clients can asks questions to the company or other visitors to our websites learn more about the company submit testimonials on their experiences with the company post reviews of the hotels restaurants and tours that are included in our packages and more further we intend to create a mobile website and a downloadable application for smartphones and tablets to allow potential clients to view and purchase our products and services from their wireless mobile devices expand our service and product portfolio we believe that expanding our product and service offerings will be an important means of acquiring clients as the diversity of our products and services will attract more clients to our current and future websites we intend to expand our products and services as we begin to acquire a steady flow of clients by providing more options to clients regarding the hotels restaurants and activities that are available to them as part of their vacation packages in anticipation of the launch of our future websites we will seek new package features throughout europe to include in our future vacation packages we also plan to offer a variety of themed packages in spain and throughout europe including honeymoon adventure family romantic and other themed packages further we intend to add more features to include in our packages for additional fees such as rental cars golf lessons and spa treatments we believe that giving clients more options will add that personal touch to each vacation package at the same time we will only expand our product and service offerings to include those businesses whose products andor services we believe are of the highest quality expand our targeted clientele initially our target clientele will be american individuals couples and groups of moderate to high net worth who travel for leisure at least once per year and who are seeking the ultimate luxury vacation as the company grows we will focus on expanding our targeted clientele to include travelers worldwide while still maintaining our focus on people of moderate to high net worth seeking a luxury vacation package if and when our clientele begins to expand we will need to increase the number of sales and customer services representatives that we hire to assist additional clients with their travel arrangements expand into new geographic markets we will expand our business to new geographic markets outside of spain including italy great britain greece and throughout europe if the company is able to generate profits from our current website located at wwwmyspanishgetawaycom and the company decides in its sole discretion that its current operations can support such expansion to that end we have secured the domain names for our anticipated future websites located at wwwmyitaliangetawaycom wwwmybritishgetawaycom wwwmygreekgetawaycom and wwwmyeuropeangetawaycom we intend to have wwwmyeuropeangetawaycom be our main domain under which all other domains will be linked the current structure that we have developed for wwwmyspanishgetawaycom would be replicated for the other future websites pursue selective strategic partnerships and acquisitions in addition to growing our business organically we may also pursue strategic acquisitions or partnerships in the united states or abroad with companies similar to us or with airlines hotels restaurants or other businesses whose products and services we include or intend to include in our vacation packages we believe that the benefit of entering into these relationships would be to complement our product and service offerings establish andor strengthen our presence in our targeted overseas markets provide us with localized management abroad and give us access to clients hotels restaurants and other businesses that we may not otherwise reach if we are able to further enhance our website and technological capabilities we believe we will be able to successfully and

of our shares under the offering we will only receive  after offering expenses have been paid we believe that these proceeds will fund our plan of operations for up to three months in this instance we will allocate all  to the development of our first website however we will have to seek out additional capital from alternate sources to execute our business plan if such funds are not available to us

proportionate reduction in funds allocated to each specific item listed and would not differ materially from the use of proceeds chart above if we are unable to generate the maximum amount of funds under this offering to finance our plan of operations for twelve months we will seek additional funding from management the issuance of equity or debt or through obtaining a credit facility we do not currently have any arrangements for obtaining additional financing and there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us we will seek such funds from friends family and business acquaintances however we have not received any firm commitments or indications of interest from our friends family members or business acquaintances regarding potential investments in our company and cannot predict when such funding may be available to us the travel and tourism industry is increasingly and intensely competitive with low barriers to entry we will compete with both established and emerging online and traditional travel companies internet travel sites and established travel agents with respect to each of the services we offer eg flights hotels etc further we will compete directly with airlines hotels restaurants and other businesses that market and sell their products and services through their own websites and may offer products and services on more favorable terms including lower prices fewer fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs such as points and miles which could make their products and services more attractive to consumers than ours due to the online nature of our business we will compete domestically in the united states and internationally particularly in spain and throughout europe further many of our competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources larger client bases and more experience in the tourism industry than we do as a result these competitors may engage in more extensive business development efforts undertake fartherreaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than us these factors may allow our competitors to generate greater revenues with fewer costs respond more quickly to new or emerging trends and changes in client requirements or achieve greater market acceptance of their services and products than we can competition could also result in reduced traffic to our current and future websites and a loss of market share we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in this industry additionally more travelers are booking their own trips using the internet and eliminating the “travel agent” however we believe that travel companies can be competitive in the industry by providing increased value to travelers through exceptional service we believe that travel companies who demonstrate that they can consistently provide extra value for their clients are more likely to receive repeat and referral business to maintain and increase their business revenues we believe that our competitive strengths will be our niche in luxury travel and the exceptionally high level of service that we intend to offer we feel that these factors will be highly valued by our targeted clientele and cannot be discounted reduced or otherwise cheapened company description seville ventures corp the “company” was incorporated in the state of nevada on february   and is currently headquartered in byron
