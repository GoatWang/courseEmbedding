simplebyedmund paleyon february  format paperbackfor anyone working with proteins for the first time this is the book it tells you how to do the basic procedures in a straightforward cookbook way without alot of theoretical background oldschool purists may object to this but just as you dont need to understand fourier optics to use a microscope you really dont need to understand how laemmli gels work in order to be able to use them to resolve proteins this book just tells you how to do what you need to do and for that purpose its really perfect using this book you can singlehandedly do each technique without needing to ask anyone or read anything else it is entirely selfcontained there arent too many methods books that can compare with this one in terms of ease of use i have used
