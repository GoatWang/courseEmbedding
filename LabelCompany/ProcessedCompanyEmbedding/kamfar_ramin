chairman and ceo of bluerock residential growth reit for his remarks ramin kamfar thank you chris and good morning everyone with me today are several key members of our executive team weve got jordan ruddy our president and ryan macdonald our managing director of investments i will open my calls – my remarks with some key financial highlights from the quarter and close with some capital markets commentary after my remarks i am going to ask ryan macdonald to give you additional operational and transactional detail so starting with the financial highlights on the revenue front we achieved significant growth as a result of our investment activity our top line revenue for the fourth quarter was  million which is a  increase from the  million in the prior year quarter which was largely as a result of significant investment activity in  our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ending december  was  million versus a net loss of  million for the prioryear quarter this net loss was caused primarily by noncash items of  million in the fourth quarter versus  million in the prioryear quarter for the quarter our adjusted funds from operations or affo was  million compared to  million in the prioryear quarter on a pershare basis affo came in at  which exceeds our guidance of  to  per share on a pro forma as invested basis which simply assumes that our investable cash was fully invested as of the beginning of the fourth quarter so that investors can get a sense of our fully invested earnings potential our affo per share was  which also exceeds our guidance range of  to  both our affo and for both our affo and pro forma affo were favorably impacted by  from the payment of our management fee in ltip with the remaining out performance coming from operations property noi dollars grew to  million in the quarter which is a  increase from  million in the prioryear quarter with noi margins consistently at  samestore noi grew to strong  for the quarter versus the prioryear quarter ryans going to provide additional detail on this for the seventh consecutive quarter brgs board determined to pay the full amount of the management fee in ltips in lieu of cash with the goal of continuing to signal the confidence of management in executing our business plan and the underlying value of our shares our asset base continues to grow significantly on a quarterly basis im happy to announce that are consolidated real estate assets at cost are up  over  billion at the end of the quarter from yearend  on the acquisition front during the quarter we closed on a record five operating properties with just under  units for  million and two developments totaling around  units for the full year  brg invested capital totaling approximately  million in gross asset value plus  properties representing about  units subsequent to quarter end we closed on two development mezzanine loans totaling  million and we are actively working on closing additional deals with another about  units on a total cost of approximately  million shifting to the capital markets side in october we saw an opportunity to reduce our cost of capital and executed an underwritten overnight offering of a series b a perpetual preferred stock raising  million at a seven and an  rate which is a  basis point savings over our series c offering which was completed just recently in july of  in addition we were able to improve the noneconomic terms of the deal so that the series d as a more attractive security being a perpetual versus a redeemable preferred so from a structural point of view thats what attracted from the prior series a and series c additionally we completed a followon offering of  million shares of class a common stock in january at an offering price of  per share for gross proceeds of bout  million the primary goal for this offering focused on building the underlying common equity base as well as executing on a robust pipeline of accretive transactions that we are continuing to see and in addition getting us closer to a number on a common side that would make us eligible for rmc ph inclusion  inclusion on the index that has been  that is one of our goals for this year and beyond we also have positive news report with a  series b nontraded preferred offering fourth quarter sales increased  on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis to  million top or trajectory is continuing into the first quarter and we expect that working out at quarterly run rate of somewhere between  million to  million in the first quarter off  were pleased to report that were making significant progress in expanding or selling group with the addition of some key brokerdealer selling agreement and our expectation is that well see the benefits from this expansion by an increase in the quarterly capital raise run rate towards the latter half of  weve previously stated that  million is the equity capital base that would be the number where it would make sense for brg and its investors to begin internalizing management the offering that closed in  allowed us to hit that number and hit that target and as i indicated on our last quarters call we started the process in the fourth quarter working in conjunction with a special committee of the board and their counsel and appropriate advisors to internalize management we are working towards a target of mid for brg to become an internally managed reit although at this point we cant guarantee the timing obviously our pro forma affo guidance for the first quarter is  to  per share which is down slightly from the fourth quarter number and thats due to normal seasonality from the winter months q being our weakest quarter in apartment business plus the accrual of the way we accrue projected tax increases for  and the timing of our dispositions which are stabilized assets and our acquisitions which are assets where weve got the value creation coming online over time now i would like to hand the call to ryan macdonald our managing director of investments to give additional commentary on our operational metrics and an overview of our transactions in the quarter ryan macdonald thank you ramin and good morning everyone id like to start off by noting that our operating portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well generally meeting or exceeding our budgets across the board as you all know the winter months typically provide for some seasonal challenges but the asset management team here has been working hard with our partners and the onsite staff to position each asset so that we can continue to capitalize on the value creation business plans set forth at acquisition portfolio wide across all of brgs assets average occupancy for the fourth quarter of  was  occupancy held firm in january as well finishing the month at  samestore noi for the fourth quarter of  increased by  from the same period in the prioryear the improvement in noi was primarily driven by a  increase in samestore property revenues of which the majority came from a  increase in average rental rates versus the prior year period the remainder of the revenue growth was attributable to an  basis point increase in our average occupancy across the portfolio as well as the purchaser  additional units at our fractured condo lansbrook and the lease up of  phase ii units at our parking kingston property located in charlotte samestore expenses rose  with a majority increase coming from payroll additions to a large asset in florida that we dont see going forward on the dispositions front in december we sold our eos development in orlando for  million which generated an internal rate of return of  on brgs equity and a return of  times invested equity in addition to the above we are in various stages of the sales process on three additional asset which we anticipate will close in the coming quarters on the investment front in the fourth quarter we closed on five operational assets and two development transactions totaling  million in gross asset value and  million in brg equity subsequent to the quarter brg invested  million in two mezzanine development opportunities in charlotte north carolina and boca raton florida both of which each are projected yield annualized affo of  the pro forma stabilized cap rate for the five closed operational properties is projected to be approximately  versus market cap rates ranging from  to  two of the assets are located in austin texas with another two in atlanta georgia and the remaining asset is located in port st lucie florida in terms of pending transactions we have four additional investments totaling  units with total projected costs of approximately  million which leaves us with  million of available capital for investment with the most recent january capital raise we anticipate the investable cash being deployed through the middle part of the year with a fully invested run rate towards the back half of  now let me review a few of the pending investments with you one pending investment is a tobebuilt  unit class a luxury garden style apartment community located in garland texas with direct access to the major dallas employment centers of cityline legacy business park and plano the transaction was sourced off market and our partner undertook a comprehensive rezoning to allow for residential use of the site which in our mind creates an attractive basis brgs underwriting projects a return on cost of  to  at stabilization for value creation of  to  basis points versus sales of comparable communities in the greater dallas msa at  to  to date brg has funded approximately  million and the mezzanine investment is projected to grow by an additional  million once vertical construction commences this quarter another pending investment is a  unit  bill core plus acquisition opportunity in emerging downtown charlotte neighborhood called wesley heights the same neighborhood that brgs recently funded development mezzanine loan we believe the neighborhood has similar path of growth characteristics to the berry hill neighborhood at the time of our successful investment in the  at berry hill development in nashville tennessee the relationship purchase offers immediate operational efficiencies through a more localized management approach where as the existing owner was managing the asset from the west coast brgs underwriting projects a stabilized cap rate of  for value creation of  to  basis points versus sales of comparable communities in the charlotte urban core at four and three quarter to five and quarter percent the purchase price of approximately  million and brg is projected to invest  of the equity equating to approximately  million with the remaining funding being capitalized with a fixedrate senior loan from freddie mac in the estimated amount of  million and a rate of approximately  another pending transaction is a relationship purchase of a  interest  unit  built garden style apartment community located in raleigh north carolina msa for a total purchase price of approximately  million the business plan contemplates executing interior renovations yielding a pro forma stabilized cap rate of approximately  which we believe compares favorably to cap rates of four and three quarters to five and quarter percent for assets of similar quality in the market the initial  equity investment is projected to be approximately  million and the acquisition is being capitalized with a floating rate senior loan from freddie mac in the amount of  million and at a rate of just under  moving to the capital markets front we want to highlight the multifamily permitting and starts were moderately down on a yearoveryear basis in the south region through december according taxes ph metrics which is consistent with what we predicted given the significant reduction in credit availability in the construction lending markets for weaker and less wellcapitalized developers due to the hvcre bank regulations and given that the demographics of underlying demand are still in place we believe this type of the file will be a strong catalyst for accelerating the multifamily fundamentals from  and beyond with respect to asset level financings our access to senior financing on the acquisition side remains robust from a variety of lenders including agencies banks and life companies today fixed rate spreads generally range from  to  basis points for all in rates of  to  with term ranging from  to  years and finally our pipeline remains very robust we are currently evaluating north of  million worth of investments totaling in excess of  units the majority of these pipeline transactions are off market and in many cases weve been working on them for extended periods of time we continue to believe there are attractive opportunities in our current footprint of growth markets from the carolinas down through florida and over to texas and with that i will now turn  return the call to ramin to conclude ramin kamfar thank you ryan thats the end of our prepared remarks with that im happy to open it up to qa operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from rob stevenson of janney please go ahead rob stevenson good morning guys ramin there was a couple in the release there was a couple of assets where you were redeemed on in the quarter and there was some conversion there can you talk a little bit about whats going on with those assets like west morehead and apok townhomes ramin kamfar hi rob those are deals where we converted from a equity or a preferred equity were switching from doing mezzanine and start doing preferred equity because as we get – in terms of our investorowned structures and the reason for that is that the preferred equity doesnt really show up on our income statement in terms of revenue so we feel that our revenue gets penalized by it whereas mezzanine is more visible and more trackable and more transparent so were switching to a mezzanine structure and those are  those were situations where were just converting from an equity or preferred equity position into a mezzanine rob stevenson okay helpful thank you and then where do you guys sit today after common and the preferred raises what do you guys look like on a pro forma leverage level at this point sitting here today ramin kamfar well i think thats in our – that’s in our supplements if you look at it on a net basis i think were in the  i think were in the s but i think weve got at you know weve got a detail of that working out in supplement that we just filed i … rob stevenson but youre going to sell three assets i mean you got a pipeline et cetera i mean where you know  what is the – whats the sort of expected proceeds and sort of rough dollar value for those three assets if you wind up selling them and you know i assume that given ryans comments about how robust pipeline is that you basically have an immediate use of proceeds on the acquisition standpoint so i guess i was just trying to figure out with the  or so million dollars of dry powder sort of what you have to sort of execute on before needing additional equity out there again ramin kamfar rob on the proceeds the total gross proceeds coming back to us is in the  million range and that actually includes the sale in the fourth quarter of the year so i think incrementally it’s about a  million of gross proceeds plus our investment basis rob stevenson okay ramin kamfar that gives us enough dry powder i think the idea or the – for the raise that we get in january was to give us an outright  you know weve got these catalyst coming up rob which is internalization being the biggest one were also working on a line of credit and you know were hoping that – and weve got some asset sales you’ve seen eos and the multiple and iors weve got on that weve got a couple more of those with similar type of returns that again help validate  help us harvest capital and we invested assertively and also helps validate our value creation model so we figure that the january race was going to be something along with this asset recycling that gets us through the internalization period where all of this news is out in the market which were hoping is going to be positive and then well reevaluate at that point rob stevenson okay and then just one last one i mean you guys gave guidance for the first quarter you know is it just too many moving parts to give guidance for the full year at this point ramin kamfar at this point it is because youve got  were getting go through it were just  if you look at our growth on a yeartoyear basis and a quartertoquarter basis so much of it depends on our access to capital and so on and so forth so were working on expanding our guidance helps you know beyond that weve been doing it on a quarterbyquarter basis were working on expanding that out but we need to get a  we need to be a little bigger to the able to do that because when youre growing your asset base by whatever it is  or  a year its – each one of these  each one of the raises that we do has a significant if weather they –if they happen or if they dont happen has a huge impact were not a big stabilized reit that can say okay were projecting raising  billion off our atm and selling  million in assets and reinvesting those you know we were like i said in my remarks were up  yearoveryear in terms of assets rob stevenson okay thanks guys i appreciate it operator the next question comes from craig kucera of wunderlich please go ahead craig kucera hey good morning guys i like to circle back on to the transition from preferred equity investment to mezzanine loan is there any change structurally in them are they still  current cash base or is there any accrued components to those ramin kamfar craig good morning its intended to be pretty much identical to the preferred structure except in the mezzanine now these are deals that get negotiated on a dealbydeal basis our target is still  but are there situations where you know where you might see that number below that if we see a deal that makes sense and thats what the economics are that are negotiated yes it may be lower than  in total or it may have an accrual component to it et cetera et cetera so the  is a setting stone it’s a target return that we like but again it depends on if youre doing a truly core asset that number may be lower its all marketdriven craig kucera okay going to some your markets you know weve been hearing from some your competitors about some supply concerns particularly in charlotte i know that rents in a few of your assets were down there sequentially how do you feel about that market now and making additional investment either on a stabilized property basis or new developments today ryan macdonald well good morning craig its ryan certainly obviously it’s an assetbyasset basis we just did – weve actually made recently two investments there i think at the super high end you know i think were a little cautious in charlotte theres a lot of obviously construction downtown including some highrise residential that i think you know rent levels are significantly above where our rent levels are on our two assets and i think we like to play in the path of growth so the characteristics of the two investments that we made fit that value creation thesis that we on all our acquisitions and development opportunities so again yes were constructive on  from a macro perspective on charlotte but i think relative to the two investments we made we think theres a lot of value opportunity ramin kamfar craig its ramin i think thats a good question its funny you should ask about charlotte because we went to investment committee and i asked the same question because we had an investment committee a year ago where were talking about supply in charlotte so let me take a step back cash way and talk globally globally what we see in terms of supply is that youre going to go through a supply issue in  and a soft patch – but if you look at the actual metrics data in november and december starts and permits were down dramatically on a yearoveryear basis which weve been  which is been part of our thesis because of high volatility dre loan regs that went into effect that make construction financing a lot more difficult so youre seeing a development  development pulled back at across almost all of our markets so  and we think that that sets you up for a strong market assuming that the economy continues to grow and you’ve got the job growth et cetera et cetera you know starting in mid and beyond so i think youre setting up for the long term post a soft patch then from there you got to drill down on the marketbymarket basis and its really a sub market by sub market basis and in the product type i think youre seeing of the  rent level i think youre seeing some supply indigestion that may not necessarily be there at the  rent level and in various submarket and on a sub market by sub market basis in fact all of our markets if you break them down outside of lets say houston if you break them down there are submarket that have a lot of supply coming and then there are other submarket that are very healthy in terms of supply demand and thats how we look at it as remember part of our strategy is that were not tied into any market or submarket because weve got an operating base there we have the flexibility with our operating partners to go across  market so we picked them based on their pure attractiveness and supply and demand is one of the things that we look at ryan macdonald and in particular on the one asset in south and craig where i think weve had some rent moderation you know there has been a few lease ups there that i think that presented challenges but they are not going to impact on the two deals that we actually made investments on or pending investments i should say craig kucera got it and kind of in the same vein i know fox hill in austin also saw some safe ph vision and there is also some quite supply concerns i know in the past you mentioned that your new investments in there were in submarkets that you felt were maybe physically protected by supply but can you give us a quick overview of your investment thesis on legacy at southpark and in the brodie again ramin kamfar sure absolutely so legacy at southpark was actually a  ill call it a fractured ownership group that the developer candidly did not perform their duties especially during lease up and so the equity capital had to come in and take over operationally once the asset was delivered and we think theres just a lot of low hanging fruit not only from an operational perspective but also some touchup items on the amenities and exterior of the property that we think generally will reposition it into an asset that will make it a class a asset that we thought we bought it ill call it class b plus type pricing so with respect to the brodie that one is more of a – ill call it repositioning play where the rent levels in that submarket are – ill call it  and our rent levels are  so our partner who is actually located in austin locally and has a significant presence and focuses on that specific business plan is on board and were coming up with the valueadd scheme and implementing that today so really its just  it’s an improvement play and brings rents to market so… craig kucera got it i appreciate it the western i think youve owned i think you purchased that may be in late  and correct me if im wrong but at what point does that convert from a preferred equity investment into an operating property on the balance sheet ramin kamfar sure it should convert into an operating property over the coming quarters durham is one of those in particular markets that i think from a micro perspective has had challenges with supply and so the stabilization on that property has taken longer than i think we originally projected that being said again the value proposition from our basis when we made the investment feels very very good especially based on recent sales but i think thats a market that will get through the indigestion that it’s seen over the past – ill call it year year and a half and wed expect it to stabilize and get to a normalized operating state over the coming quarters craig kucera okay go ahead i am sorry ramin kamfar yes craig kucera okay one more for me i just wanted to follow up on the guidance for this first quarter just your comments on dispositions for me was that  is the guidance assuming any additional dispositions in the first quarter or is that just the impact of the dispositions you made in the fourth quarter and loosen that income ramin kamfar it’s the disposition – well weve got a couple of deals that are  that we expect may close this quarter that are stabilized assets so weve said that we like to be into assets that are  or plus type of cap rate now you cant buy all type of assets in all type of markets at a  and thats why were buying you know attractive institutional quality assets and attractive submarkets with value creation and i were growing them whatever it is a  to  basis points to get to  so when you sell an asset and weve got a couple of that are under contract and you are generating a significant multiple an irs in high s or s that’s reflective of the value creation so you are north is of that  when youre buying an asset to replace that that assets come again at lower than a  and its going to be post takeover and its going to take a couple of quarters depending on whether its better operations or as we as take over operations and push rents or if its interior upgrades are amenity upgrades et cetera et cetera may be over longer periods than a couple of quarters that that cap rate starts to – that return on costs starts to move up so you  as you do this  as we get bigger there will be less of an issue but when youre small  again our size and youre selling you know three significant assets its going to you know youll it moves your numbers around a little bit does that make sense craig craig kucera yes that’s what i was thinking and then sorry i have one last one this is really accounting follow up you reported a gain on revaluation of equity of a business combination can you give us some color on what that is and it is it… ramin kamfar that was… craig kucera gain on sale ramin kamfar that was a gain on sale on eos but my understanding is that we  because we wanted to do a  so that not to  not to get taxable gain on it what we have to do some structuring to  before the sale to do that and the gain comes into play at the time of the strike the way the accounting works the gain gets realized at the time of the restructure as opposed to the time of the sale so effectively from your point of view and my point of view it’s a gain on sale chris feel free to correct me if im incorrect craig kucera no you hit on the head ramin okay thanks guys ramin kamfar they accounted for differently craig kucera thank you very much operator operator instructions the next question comes from steve shaw of compass point please go ahead steve shaw hey guys could you talk about where you are in the internalization process and how my ga or the ga run rate look after the internalization process is done ramin kamfar hi steve where we are on the internalization process is that we have met where and responded to documents and diligence request from the special committee and its advisors the special committee has retained counsel and they retained financial advisor and i will tell you they are very intelligent – they are being very diligently in terms of exercising their duties of care and other duties as independent board members to make sure that they do a  they do a thorough job here and so they provided us with information and data and diligence requested and we provided that theres a compensation consultant in addition to the advisors thats been hired they advised them in terms of compensation program design and structure and amounts and so on and so forth and thats been provided to them so we are still – in terms of your two questions with respect to where we are in the process were in the middle of it our target is still to be internalized id like to say at the end of the second quarter the lawyers tell me thats not correct it would technically be the beginning of the third quarter so thats our target thats what were pushing for but i have to tell that for us the soon is better but to a certain extent its out of our hands theres  the structuring involved theres a fairness opinion involved and theres a proxy and vote involved and its getting driven by  the timing gets driven by the special committee and advisors im so hopeful that our target timeframe is achievable in terms of the management the ga figure from a ga point of view i think that the number were looking at a cash ga number as based on what weve seen the compensation consultant proposed versus our comps and versus our current management fee thats going to roll down by a  by a healthy amount so  but again all those numbers are preliminary and subject to gone through the process here does that answer your question steve shaw yes thank you operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to ramin kamfar for any closing remarks ramin kamfar thank you
