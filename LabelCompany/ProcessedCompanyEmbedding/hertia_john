reminder this conference call is being recorded id now like to turn the conference over to ron hutton you may begin ronald w hutton  treasurer  vice president thank you karan before we begin the call i would like to caution everyone that we will be making forwardlooking statements about managements goals plans and expectations our future financial performance and other matters because our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations you should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements and i encourage you to review our filings with the sec where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business the company does not intend to update any forwardlooking statements made during the call today with that id like to turn over the call to christine tsingos executive vice president and chief financial officer christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks ron good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us with me today are norman schwartz john goetz shannon hall president of our life science group and john hertia president of our diagnostics group net sales for the first quarter of  were  million a slight decrease versus the same period last years sales of  million this decline reflects the continued strong currency headwind which represented a negative impact on sales of nearly  million on a currency neutral basis sales increased  during the quarter we experienced good currency neutral growth across many of our key market and product areas most notably in our life science segment as well as certain products and markets in our diagnostics segment sales growth in the quarter was somewhat tempered by continued weakness in the european diagnostic market as well as challenges in the eastern european region both of which posted a decline in currency neutral sales versus last year offsetting these tepid regions was solid growth in the us asia pacific and selected emerging markets the reported gross margin for the first quarter was in line with expectations at  compared to  last year the current quarter margin is the result of good product mix partially offset by increased costs the higher margin in the first quarter of last year reflected sizable favorable manufacturing variances during that period making the first quarter of this year a bit tough to compare amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was higher at  million which compares to  million in the first quarter of last year the increase in amortization relates to the newly acquired flow cytometry technology for the cell biology market sga expenses for the first quarter were up slightly at  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales last year when compared to last year sga expense during the quarter benefited from the strong us dollar excluding the currency benefit sga spending increased approximately  million versus last year this increase is substantially the result of higher depreciation and spending on professional services total amortization of intangibles recorded in sga for the quarter was  million research and development expense in q was in line with expectations at  of sales or  million which compares to  million or  of sales in the first quarter of last year the increase in spending relates to our investments in droplet digital pcr technology and products for both the research and diagnostic market during the quarter interest and other income was a net expense of  million compared to  million of expense in q of last year this decrease in net expense versus last year is largely related to lower foreign exchange hedging costs the effective tax rate used during the first quarter was  this higher than expected rate includes discrete items related to losses in some of our smaller foreign locations as well as increased reserves for foreign tax audit given the first quarter rate and excluding any discrete items that may occur during the year we now expect the fullyear effective tax rate to be at the top of our previously stated range of around  net income for the first quarter was  million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were  looking to our segments life science sales in the first quarter were an impressive  million an increase of  on a reported basis when compared to last year and growth of nearly  on a currency neutral basis this growth was driven by continued strong demand for our droplet digital pcr products as well as strong sales of our process chromatography media we are especially pleased with the continued growth in our process media business where our products are now specified in  fda approved drugs during the quarter we also experienced good growth of our amplification and western blotting products on a geographic basis life science currency neutral sales were particularly strong in western europe china and the us this growth was partially offset by slower sales in the eastern european region from a strategic standpoint during the first quarter we made two significant announcements regarding our life science group the first is our new exclusive partnership with illumina to develop the most comprehensive nextgen sequencing workflow for singlecell analysis and the second is our acquisition of a new highperformance analytical flow cytometer platform we hope to launch both of these products by the end of the year which should bode well for continued growth in  sales of clinical diagnostics products were  million compared to  million last year a decrease of  on a reported basis on a currency neutral basis yearoveryear sales were up about  for the diagnostics group highlighting a currency headwind to sales of more than  million additionally the overall growth rate reflects a delay in some orders as well as continued competitive and pricing pressure especially in europe during the quarter we posted excellent growth in the us as well as japan and the asia pacific region from a product standpoint sales of quality control diabetes monitoring and autoimmune testing products continued to grow nicely of particular note demand for our bioplex  instrument and assays continues to gain momentum as many customers around the world adopt the system and additional panel and finally during the first quarter we announced receiving ce ivd marking for the qx droplet digital pcr system so that medical practitioners in europe can use our platform as an aid in clinical decision making looking to the balance sheet as of march  total cash and shortterm investments were  million net cash generated from operations during the quarter was a negative  million compared to a plus  million in the yearago period this decrease in cash flow versus last year is the result of lower sales on a reported basis which includes approximately  million of currency headwinds in receivables higher payments to suppliers and increased employeerelated payments associated with various  incentive plan net capital expenditures for the quarter were lower than expected at  million our full year expectation for capex remains in the  million to  million range as we continue to invest in our global erp system and related infrastructure projects and finally depreciation and amortization for the quarter was  million moving to the outlook on our last earnings call we shared our thinking for  that is our goals for currency neutral sales growth of  to  full year gross margins in the  range and targeting to hold the operating margin flat at about  on a currency neutral basis we also highlighted the strengthening of the us dollar against our major currencies could result in a topline currency headwind of  million to  million and thus perhaps flat yearoveryear reported sales and while we do have some natural hedge with our expense mix we guided that this sizable headwind could negatively impact our projected currency neutral operating margin by  basis points or more for the full year as you can see with our first quarter results the currency impact is still fairly significant negatively impacting sales by nearly  million and operating profit around  million despite the relatively low profitability posted in the first quarter we are maintaining our guidance for the base business given at the beginning of the year however i want to reiterate what we have been saying about the numerous challenges to maintaining flat yearoveryear operating margins during what will be a year of even greater investment in systems and infrastructure as we move through  we will carefully monitor the topline growth and ongoing investments with a goal of meeting our margin targets and one final note regarding the outlook with the acquisition of the new flow cytometer we expect that amortization expense will increase approximately  per quarter and now we are happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from brandon couillard with jefferies your line is open christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer brandon brandon couillard  jefferies llc hey thanks good afternoon yeah can you hear me ronald w hutton  treasurer  vice president yes brandon couillard  jefferies llc christine business could you break out the effect of as you saw in growth in eastern europe on just the overall segment if you back out those two regions which have been weak for sometime though sort of what does the base business look like in terms of growth christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer so youre breaking up a little backing out i think i heard eastern europe and something else brandon couillard  jefferies llc yeah just if we back out those two weak markets how would growth look for this segment sort of excluding those two regions christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer for diagnostics brandon couillard  jefferies llc yes christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer so eastern europe is smaller than some of the other segments and obviously on a currency neutral basis backing it out would increase their growth rate but western europe is probably one of the largest regions if not and i guess the us is probably larger now than europe with whats been going on in europe so i dont have a specific growth rate but i think that itd be safe that it would be a couple of points brandon couillard  jefferies llc im not sure if john hertias there but i mean if you had a point to one market or product vertical where you think youre gaining some share which it certainly seems like you might be at least in the us market what are the kind of top two or three sort of contributors which you think are accounting for the strength john hertia  executive vice president  president clinical diagnostics group brandon if i get this right you are asking for what markets might be strengthening in the us market christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer gaining share yeah brandon couillard  jefferies llc yeah thats right im sorry if im not coming through sorry john hertia  executive vice president  president clinical diagnostics group we were pretty strong across almost all segments in the us line we did introduce i think wed reported in the last conference call we did get fda approval for a new diabetes instrument the d and got approval for a new blood typing instrument the infinity and those are both contributing and as christine mentioned bioplex is doing very well around the world and that certainly is contributing to the us too especially in the areas of autoimmune mumps testing and in the expansion of hiv and vitamin d brandon couillard  jefferies llc super while i have you any update you can share with us on the status of the new bio project john hertia  executive vice president  president clinical diagnostics group the new bio project continues continue to make progress and were anticipating something in the near future brandon couillard  jefferies llc all right john hertia  executive vice president  president clinical diagnostics group obviously its still in development brandon couillard  jefferies llc okay last one christine do you have a revised fx outlook in terms of the revenue impact for the year you can share with us christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer well i mean it all depends on where the currencies go from here so i think we will stick with the originally anticipated – that kind of  million to  million we had  million of it on the top line in the first quarter i still think that as we get to the second half of the year then we dont have the same headwinds but a lot of that brandon is just going to depend on what happens to the rate brandon couillard  jefferies llc got you okay thanks i will hop back thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from dan leonard with leerink partners your line is open kevin c chen  leerink partners llc hi this is actually kevin chen in for dan today so my first question is regarding the life sciences were there any onetime items or large orders in the quarter and how should we think about the order rate for that business christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer i think the life science growth its a combination of really good ongoing strength in some of the base business and the droplet digital pcr technology we did have a good quarter for the process media which can be a lumpy business as customers will buy in bulk and so in any given quarter there could be  million to  million of an extra order in there but even that business is starting to smooth out a little now that we have such a broad reach of customers kevin c chen  leerink partners llc got it thanks and then my follow up would be on china recently expanded their life science spending im just curious what youre hearing on the ground over there and do you perhaps see any incremental tailwinds going forward christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer china life science spending trends continues to be pretty robust i guess thats the way i would describe it kevin c chen  leerink partners llc okay thats good to know and then and just lastly i know you mentioned tax rate was so far in the highend of the range but how would it trend throughout the year was it – can you just help us understand that christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think you know we guided to  to  and now weve just kind of banked a  in terms of the effective tax rate obviously as the year moves on some of the discrete items get spread on an annualized basis so i think for a base rate of being in that  to  is where well probably trend for the year because of the q  you know i think the math is going to point more to that that higher end at  with the caveat of you know every quarter there could be discrete items that move the rate either up or down kevin c chen  leerink partners llc okay thats very helpful thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from jeffrey matthews with ram partners your line is open jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp thanks hi everybody christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer hey jeff jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp christine you mentioned increase in professional fees as part of the sga increase on a currency neutral basis does that relate to the erp spending and is that going to increase as you go into your next phase christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer some of it relates to erp some relates to legal costs but i think for the erp weve talked about spending operating expenses in that  million low  million number and i think thats probably still the right number to use remember a lot of the professional fees with the project are actually capitalized labor but then there is a lot of kind of side projects if you will other systems that are impacted by this that require some professional services as well jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp okay thanks and then the dollar has been pretty weak lately and the last time you came out with your here is what the dollar is going do to us this year i think that was pretty much close to the peak in the dollar are you just not dont want to change your outlook at this point you want to see where things go or has there been no movement in the currencies that are really particular to biorad christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer well so no jeff its a good point and we have seen since december  some weakening in the dollar even against some of our major currencies but we also have exposure to the russian ruble and brazil and some currencies that are still a bit volatile so its kind of a mixed bag for us obviously if we keep trending this way then the currency headwinds for the full year should come in lower than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp okay and then on the illumina announcement how did that come about and when might there be something in the marketplace related to that john hertia  executive vice president  president clinical diagnostics group so i guess it came about this whole area of single cell analysis is something thats of more and more interest to customers and illumina was looking for a kind of a complete solution for the customers and i guess they probably approached us i dont know who made the first move but got together and looked at what we could do together with that and so thats i guess thats the way it basically came about the two groups are working pretty closely together and anticipate something coming out around the end of the year jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp okay great and then a final one im just curious on the us it seems like weve had some loosening up in the nih budget or increases in it and you seem more optimistic in the us is just things generally better here now than they have been john hertia  executive vice president  president clinical diagnostics group yes theres certainly i mean the word sequestration has seemed to have dropped out of everybodys vocabulary and i think thats certainly a big help in addition to that i think there is certainly an increased focus the government has kind of i would say gotten back on track with the importance and value of this basic science and investing in science in the nih and so i think thats a good trend jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp great thanks very much operator thank you and im showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to christine tsingos for any further remarks christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer so can you just poll one more time operator yes and im still showing no further questions christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer okay operator oh we do have one more question from jeffrey matthews from ram partners your line is open jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp what the heck john hertia  executive vice president  president clinical diagnostics group okay jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp havent asked the acquisition question in a while just wondering what the landscape looks like these days money got pretty tight in the first quarter and it seemed to be a good time to be a biorad seller i dont know if thats filtered into any of the companies you are looking at but are you optimistic about adding anything to the portfolio this year john hertia  executive vice president  president clinical diagnostics group yeah we are optimistic as you know its always hard to say when something might actually happen or what competition for it might be but we continue to kind of work along that path and im certainly hoping that we can do something this year jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp thanks very much good luck operator thank you and our next question comes from brandon couillard from jefferies your line is open brandon couillard  jefferies llc thanks question for shannon on the process chromatography business christine called out  fda approved products in which you are specified is that a substantially higher number than where you are lets say  months ago shannon hall  executive vice president  president life science group not substantially christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer its certainly higher shannon hall  executive vice president  president life science group yeah john hertia  executive vice president  president clinical diagnostics group but i think the point is that it continues to grow and i think the other point is being specd in those drugs is a good indicator of a repeatable or continuous business brandon couillard  jefferies llc okay then one question for john goetz i would love to get your views sort of as we look out over the next lets call it  months what does the time line look like for the erp deployment in europe kind of when do you expect to turn the first – golive in the first country and then kind of walk us all the way through the end of next year john goetz  chief operating officer  executive vice president okay we are currently in the i would say the configuration phase of the project right now our teams are working on it as we speak in europe a lot of that is cleaning up data of course but its the localization of the system that weve put in place here in the us but having it more applicable to what were doing in europe we see a golive timeframe right at the start of second quarter next year thats our  its kind of our hard target and assuming everything goes well well flip the switch at that time and of course when you do that you immediately jump on that system with a lot of hyper care as you pull yourself through the mess of a go live so then well see probably another couple of quarters maybe even three quarters of stabilization over there its a pretty complicated roll out and then i think were probably going to take subsequent roll outs in more bite size pieces as we maybe complete the rest of our european deployment there is some countries that are excluded in this scope and then well move onto asia in the subsequent quarters and kind of go from there but by the time we finish this deployment that we plan for europe which is a golive in that second quarter timeframe next year well have captured the lion share of our manufacturing plants and topline sales so thats – were really encouraged by that brandon couillard  jefferies llc super thank you operator thank you and im showing no further questions christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer okay great well thank
