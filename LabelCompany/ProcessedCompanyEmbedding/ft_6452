posterproduct type presentationyear authors ramotnik casuggested citation ramotnik ca  effect of wildfire on abundance detection probability and arthropod prey base of sacramento mountain salamanders aneides hardii poster on may   a wildfire burned almost  acres of highelevation forest in southcentral new mexico within the range of the sacramento mountain salamander aneides hardii although the fire caused an immediate temporary increase in the ability to detect salamanders on severely burned sites counts of salamanders on those areas declined sharply one year after the fire and have remained low for  years population estimates were highest on lightly burned sites intermediate on unburned and lowest on severely burned sites coverboard surveys of salamanders may be preferable over timeconstrained searches because the size of the search area is standardized and the relationship to actual population levels is known detection probabilities of aneides hardii averaged  to  percent on burned and unburned sites and are much higher than those found in eastern plethodontid salamanders this may reflect the drier less hospitable and more open nature of forests in southern new mexico overall effects of the fire on the abundance and community composition of forest floor arthropods appear to be moderate with beetle and spider community composition becoming less diverse and less abundant family richness on burned sites has not yet returned to preburn levels after  years related projects title completion year investigator studies on the sacramento mountain salamander effects
