operations issuers may be corporations investment trusts or domestic or foreign governments issuers are legally responsible for the obligations of the issue and for reporting financial conditions material developments and any other operational activities as required by the regulations of their jurisdictions breaking down issuer the most common types of securities issued are common and preferred stocks bonds notes debentures bills and derivatives to illustrate the role of an issuer imagine abc corporation sells common shares to the general public on the market to generate capital to finance its business operations this means abc corporation is an issuer and is therefore required to file with regulators such as the securities and exchange commission sec disclosing relevant financial information about the company abc must also meet any legal obligations or regulations in the jurisdiction where it issued the security writers of options are occasionally referred to as issuers of options because they also sell securities on a marketissuers versus investorswhile the entity that creates and sells a bond or another type of security is referred to as an issuer the individual who buys the security is an investor in some cases the investor is also referred to as a lender essentially the investor is lending the issuer funds which are repayable when the bond matures or the stock is sold as a result the issuer is also considered to be a borrower and the investor should carefully examine the borrowers risk of default before buying the security or lending funds to the issuercredit ratings of issuersratings firms such as standard and poors and moodys create credit ratings for issuers of debt securities just as credit bureaus create credit profiles and scores for individual consumers rather than being expressed as a number like consumer credit scores issuer scores are pegged to letters for example if an entity has a aaa rating it has a history of repaying its debts and boasts a very low rate of default conversely it an entity has a ddd rating it is in default issuers with ratings of bb or below have their bonds labeled as junk indicating that they pose a high risk of default for investorscountries also receive credit ratings for example after greece missed billions of dollars of loan repayments its credit rating was downgraded to ccc however after the country implemented reforms cut costs and recapitalized its banks standard and poors increased its rating to b indicating that the companys bonds are a bit safer trading center
