medical research agency until october  dr zerhouni a world renowned leader in the field of radiology and medicine spent his career providing clinical scientific and administrative leadership he is credited with developing imaging methods used for diagnosing cancer and cardiovascular disease as one of the world’s premier experts in magnetic resonance imaging mri he had extended the role of mri from taking snapshots of gross anatomy to visualizing how the body works at the molecular level he pioneered magnetic tagging a noninvasive method of using mri to track the motions of a heart in three dimensions he is also renowned for refining an imaging technique called computed tomographic ct densitometry that helps discriminate between noncancerous and cancerous nodules in the lung during his tenure as nih director dr zerhouni oversaw a number of milestones reauthorization demonstrated renewed confidence in nih congress passed and president bush signed into law the national institutes of health reform act of  the agencys third reauthorization in history and first since  it signaled renewed confidence in the nih mission its employees and its leadership initiated the nih roadmap for medical research in september  dr zerhouni launched a marquee initiative the nih roadmap for medical research a new research vision to accelerate medical discovery to improve health immediately focused the attention of the biomedical research community on new pathways of discovery research teams for the future and the reengineering of the clinical research enterprise development of a new office to improve transnih initiatives in  nih launched a new office within the office of the nih director to transform the way nih finds and funds cuttingedge research improve the ability to identify public health challenges and increase transnih dialogue decisionmaking and prioritysetting the office built upon the model of the nih roadmap for medical research and increases coordination with nih ics and external stakeholders to identify research priorities that will ultimately improve nih’s ability to be nimble dynamic and responsive to emerging scientific opportunities and public health needs the new entity eventually named the division of program coordination planning and strategic initiatives dpcpsi provides an “incubator space” to jumpstart transnih initiatives and support institutes and centers that take the lead on priority projects on a timelimited basis  to  years these initiatives are supported by a common fund established an nihwide research initiative to address the obesity epidemic the strategic plan for nih obesity research addresses one of the nation’s most dramatic health changes with a multidimensional research agenda the strategic plan enhances both the development of new research in areas of greatest scientific opportunity and the coordination of obesity research across the nih the plan called for interdisciplinary research teams to bridge the study of behavioral and environmental causes of obesity with the study of genetic and biologic causes supported the nih neuroscience blueprint mental illness neurological disorders and a range of behavioral disorders are major causes of human suffering and contribute greatly to the burden of disease the blueprint leverages the abilities of the institutes and centers to create new resources tackle common scientific problems and train the next generation of neuroscientists through collaboration and leadership made health disparities a research priority dr zerhouni’s commitment to eliminating health disparities and disparities in the burden of disease was evidenced by broadening the collaborative relationships developed through partnerships between nih and institutions and researchers from all populations ensured public access to nihfunded research results february   dr zerhouni announced a historic public access policy for the first time the public gained access to peerreviewed research publications that resulted from studies funded by nih dr zerhouni urged maximum participation by investigators encouraging scientists to submit their publications as soon as possible and within twelve months of publication to the accessible archive dr zerhouni was committed to earning the public’s trust and sought advice from the council of public representatives coprcopr held the first ever public trust workshop to inventory and respond to public needs prior to joining nih dr zerhouni served as executive vicedean of johns hopkins university school of medicine chair of the russell h morgan department of radiology and radiological science and martin donner professor of radiology and professor of biomedical engineering before that he was vice dean for research at johns hopkins dr zerhouni’s imaging research has led to advances in computerized axial tomography cat scanning and magnetic resonance imaging mri it has earned him a gold medal from the american roentgen ray society for ct research and two paul lauterbur awards for mri research dr zerhouni has also received the special presidential award of the european congress of radiology from – he served on the national cancer institute’s board of scientific advisors he was a consultant to both the world health organization  and to the white house under president ronald reagan  in april  france bestowed its highest

nih research  the nih record  june   vol lxv no  nih record home nih record archives nih home page june   cover next story from new vantage exdirector zerhouni surveys value of nih research by rich mcmanus on the front page former nih director dr elias zerhouni gives remarks at june  smrb meeting in bldg  nearly  years removed from his nih directorship dr elias zerhouni returned to campus june  to offer his views about how to value nih research economically in an era of flat federal research budgets his remarks at the end of a daylong meeting on that topic conducted by the scientific review management board smrb included vintage observations from the veteran of academia johns hopkins government he was nih director from  to  and industry he is president of global research and development at french pharmaceutical firm sanofi for example his comment that its not very smart to go to the grocery store in an f fighter jet when you can go on a bike both brought the house down and illustrated the occasional mismatch between drug costs and human benefit he was especially critical of expensive cancer drugs stacked one on top of another that might buy a patient only a few months of time continued admitting at the outset that measuring nih’s value is a very difficult topic he added “i am not here for an academic discussion of how medical research should be valued…that has been said today i am sure by the speakers you invited i shared for example in congress that the  per year invested per person in the united states since the s on cardiovascular research now results in  trillion of economic value every year the problem with these kinds of statements is that you can easily make them but you can’t easily prove them” zerhouni was asked to discuss “value of federally funded biomedical research in the development of medical interventions and treatments” in a minute address followed by questions he argued that “the notion of value changes over time” and that narrowly defined metrics tend to be misleading the most important criteria he said is whether dollars are assigned in a way that satisfies societal expectations before giving his remarks zerhouni is greeted by nih principal deputy director dr lawrence tabak and by nidcr director dr martha somerman and obscured nigms acting director dr judith greenberg photos ernie branson “the product of nih should be knowledge not products” he said “how do we achieve reduction in the burden of disease and reduction in the burden of health care costs how do we transform knowledge into societal benefit” with the engineer’s cast of mind that distinguished his nih leadership zerhouni said “i have a simple matrix in my mind” a series of pragmatic measurable steps for “transforming ideas into knowledge” he enumerated four steps in translation t through t “t is when you are truly on the edge of understanding some process or disease biology” he explained the criteria for valuing work at this stage “will be completely different” from how one values t research which involves applying the fruits of basic research to the practice of public health “this is getting mixed up in the public debate” he said zerhouni plumbed nih history for examples of the interdependency of various translational steps in achieving an acknowledged public health success it was the longterm framingham heart study that picked up cholesterol as an important signal in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality he recounted that work led to drs michael brown and joseph goldstein’s nobel prizewinning studies that “changed the practice of medicine “how many times has nih science done this” zerhouni asked rhetorically in stroke there has been a  percent reduction that’s t change in the practice of medicine in recent decades but what has been the value of nih research when only  percent of patients with diabetes comply with their medications and  percent don’t zerhouni wondered “and only  percent of patients with high blood pressure are compliant with their medication” he called implementation or behavioral research a worthy investment “look at a map of the united states” he said “why are there all these pockets of disparity in health outcomes when the knowledge is the same everywhere” zerhouni’s favorite example of nih delivering on its promise to society is the women’s health initiative’s finding during his directorship that hormone replacement therapy proved more harmful than helpful to women “that’s value” he declared “and it’s important to quantify that value…this kind of impact is very valuable and measurable you can point to lives saved quality of lives number of years” zerhouni also greets nibib director dr roderic pettigrew in wilson hall prior to his talk in any discussion of value zerhouni emphasized the need to personalize results the goal he said is outcomes that relate directly to societal expectations in a country where chronic diseases account for  percent of health care costs he said “federal investment needs to be tied to the societal needs of the day otherwise you risk academic isolation or living in some theoretical realm…patients measure better than anybody the value of research” zerhouni said his personal view is that nih should devote  percent of its budget to generate new knowledge “i wouldn’t go below that no matter what” he concluded with three lessons “don’t damage young investigators give ’em a chance and give it early don’t kill them with rigidity— years of this then  years of that…they end up exhausted at the end of such combat” “we have moved away from studying human disease in humans” he lamented “we all drank the koolaid on that one me included” with the ability to knock in or knock out any gene in a mouse—which “can’t sue us” zerhouni quipped—researchers have overrelied on animal data “the problem is that it hasn’t worked and it’s time we stopped dancing around the problem…we need to refocus and adapt new methodologies for use in humans to understand disease biology in humans” “budget pressures are going to kill any inkling of innovation” zerhouni warned that there are  diseases that if not solved within the next  years will certainly bankrupt some societies zerhouni took half a dozen questions from smrb members assembled in wilson hall and made a number of other observations game approaches to compliance fascinate him “we’ve got to be able to engage the patient beyond a visit every  months coupled with a series of ‘thou shalt nots’” the power of social networks or socalled “influencers” has been underutilized in public health statins are phenomenally overprescribed only  percent of the patients who take them realize any benefit “so  percent of what we do with statins is not helpful” zerhouni said any consideration of the value of research that does not take the customer into account is doomed he warned “you’ve lost the debate if you lose sight of the taxpayers and the patients” back to top of page
