antiterrorism technologies and placed on the “approved products list for homeland security” we were issued the “designation” and “certification” for our technology by the department of homeland security under the support antiterrorism by fostering effective technologies act of  the safety act in july of   in january  the designation and certification was extended for blastwrap until november the safety act  “designation” and “certification” are intended to support effective technologies aimed at preventing detecting identifying or deterring acts of terrorism or limiting the harm that such acts might otherwise cause the criteria technologies must meet to be awarded “designation” and “certification” status include the availability of the technology for immediate deployment in public and private settings the magnitude of risk exposure to the public if the technology is not deployed the evaluation of scientific studies being feasibly conducted to assess the technology’s capability to substantially reduce risks of harm and the technology’s effectiveness in facilitating the defense against acts of terrorism blastwrap is designed to mitigate the blast effects of an explosion by rapidly extinguishing the fireball eliminating burns and postblast fires and reducing the subsequent overpressures by more than  thus reducing damage to people and property the safety act legislation was designed to encourage the development and rapid deployment of lifesaving antiterrorism technologies by providing manufacturers or sellers with limited risk to legal liability it was also designed to harness the nation’s scientific and technological resources to provide federal state and local officials with the technology and capabilities to protect the united states from terrorist acts one area of focus for the department of homeland security is catastrophic terrorist threats to the nation’s security that could result in largescale loss of life and major economic impact the safety act fosters research of technologies to counter threats both by evolutionary improvements to current capabilities and development of revolutionary new capabilitiesgsa approved product general services administration enters into contracts with commercial firms to provide supplies and services at stated prices this streamlined procurement vehicle is available to federal agencies and other

pressure and impulse reduction and such low a momentum exchange blastwrap® also differs from other technologies in that it doesn’t offer another armored barrier at a protected position but provides a proven method of reducing blast energy at source or before it can interact with structure  blastwrap® adds little extra weight and cost but builds in a large amount of threat protection to existing

blastwrap® material has been designed to mitigate blasts and suppress flash fires resulting from explosions regardless of the material or compound causing the explosion we believe that this technology can be used to create new finished products or designed to retrofit existing productsmitigation or attenuation of blast effects is the dissipation of blast energy so that acoustic and shock waves peak overpressure reflected peak overpressure impulse and afterburn the rapid burning of combustible materials in the “hot zone” including soot occurring so fast that it adds to blast effect from the original explosive are reduced this reduction is accomplished through both physical and chemical processes that are triggered when a blast occurs the remaining energy is transmitted at a slower more sustainable level the amount of reflected energy is significantly reduced with mitigation unlike hardening systems the performance of our products is not related directly to material thickness and therefore we believe our products have a greater range of uses producing the same or better effectiveness against blast effectsour blastgard® technology is designed to mitigate blast and rapid combustion phenomena through numerous mechanisms the relative contribution of each mechanism depends upon the intensity and nature of the impinging hazard shock wave attenuation for example is dominant in mitigating mechanical explosions our products attempt to emulate unconfined conditions and accelerate attenuating processes that occur in free air thus blastwrap® does not try to resist blasts which physically intensify blast phenomena it mitigates them blastwrap® can be used as part of confining assemblies containers and blast walls in effect blastwrap® is a ‘virtual vent’our blastwrap® products are made from two flexible films arranged one over the other and joined by a plurality of seams filled with attenuating filler material volcanic glass bead or other suitable twophase materials configurable designed for each application with an extinguishing coating together this combination of materials is designed to mitigate a blast while at the same time eliminate fireballs or flame fronts produced by the blastblastwrap® works hours a day quenches fireballs and post blast fires reduces blast impulse and pressure does not dispense chemical extinguishants uses neither alarms sensors nor an activation system and is nontoxic and ecologically friendly  how it works how it works our blastgard® technology extracts heat decelerates both blast wind and shock waves and quenches the hot gases in all blasts and fireballs blastwrap® does not interact with the explosive elements and is therefore not altered by them however after a single intense detonation blastwrap® must be replacedfor blasts that produce fireballs or intense hot gases at higher pressures blastgard® technology has the ability through testing to cool the blast zone rapidly thereby reducing structural damagein detonation of high explosives where at least half of the energy released is in the shock wave attenuation occurs even more rapidly and in doing so substantially reduces explosion phenomenathe performance of blastwrap® proprietary technology is independent of scenario and environment which means that it does not matter where the physical location is how the basic product form is used or the environment in which the event takes place the basic product form can be used as a standalone material as linings curtain barriers or as structural material or can be laminated or otherwise affixed to a wide range of product forms such as insulation thermal and acoustic ballistic armor or packaging materials blastwrap® products can thus provide blast and fire protection in flooring wall and roof constructions in packaging in storage cabinets and other containment structures and aboard all types of vehicles ships and aircraftan explosion results from the rapid conversion of chemical energy into rapidly expanding highpressure gases the rapidly expanding gases compress the surrounding air much like a piston and create a shock wave that travels ahead of the explosive gases  the “overpressure” pressure above ambient in a shock wave acts to “precondition” the air as it passes through to make the following accelerated gas “piston” more damaging this high intensity short duration overpressure wave transfers impulse momentum which stresses damages or destroys structures in its path impulse follows the shock wave but lingers and decays with time the negative phase is a partial vacuum that “whips” lighter structures to magnify damage a shock wave can be likened to an initial hard punch while the impulse is more like a powerful bulldozer  any reduction in the effective power of the shock wave will increase the target’s capability to withstand the destructive impulseblastwrap is scientifically engineered and designed to remove much or most of the energy from an explosion it actually interferes with the blast energy process there are two primary components of any explosion – mechanical effects which are shock impulse and acoustic waves and chemicalthermal effects fireball in fact shock impulse is the real killer in a high explosive blast blastwrap dissipates blast shock wave energy through irreversible processes such as drag turbulence friction viscosity reflection etc and at the same time blastwrap dramatically quenches the flame fronts or fireballs created as a result of the explosion in milliseconds this is important because a fireball which represents the rapid gas expansion by the burning of materials creates enormous pressures commonly called “the blast wind” as a result of that blastwrap also kills the phenomena of afterburn which can initiate postblast fires blastgard international inc  blga  stock price today  zacks quote overview stock activity open  day low  day high   wk low   wk high  avg
