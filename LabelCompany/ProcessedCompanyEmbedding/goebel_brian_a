few dates and a trip to the movie theatre to see the worlds worst movie it was decided that the timing wasnt quite right throughout the years they kept in touchin  molly and brian reconnected via

grew from there in the fall of  brian and molly took europe on during their great european adventure during this time they continued to learn about each other and grow in their relationship both would agree this is where they truly fell in love perhaps it was the bottomless house wine and the beautiful waters of the mediterranean sea but it the end they both returned from that trip and knewin

found prior to the big purchase brian called mollys father david for his permission for mollys hand in marriage brian recalled daves comments as it never is easy to give your daughter away but i think that this is a great ideait was brians intent to wait until spring of  to ask molly on the beach in florida but with stacy knowing and about all of the groomsmen and bridemaides knowing the time needed to come sooner rather than later in late november brian put his love of thanksgiving behind him and went clark griswold on their home in bloomington as they were decorating their first

every opportunity he could get to visit mike and his wife jackie in the south in  mike and his wife moved back home and currently reside  mile from molly  brian in bloomington mn over the years too many stories come to mind to even begin to share stories from the nebraska vs miami weekend in south beach the great cheese curd fight of  to the forbidden story of the jv golf match no matter the story no matter the situation mike has been there with and for brian its no surprise mike was asked to be one of brians best men vincent aydin  best manbrother vincents story is a unique one to say the least in  vincent was an exchange student at prior lake high school brian and vincent first met on first day of the second week of adays when the coaches asked that brian look after our german friend brian took that as be nice and dont light the kid up after brian had an adult learning opportunity from his coach he proceeded to hit vincent as hard as he possibly could during a team scrimmage this was the moment brian truly understood the beauty of the german language in the spirit of happiness we will leave the translation of those words for everyones imagination throughout the season vincent continued to get better and better as his understanding of american football increased in the spring of  they both graduated and went on their separate ways as luck would have it in  a little thing called facebook was created somewhere along the way a friend request was sent once facebook friends conversations between vincent and brian about the glory days became frequent along with conversations of brians lifelong dream of visiting germany in the summer before brians first senior year of college there was a victory lap in there vincent invited brian to join him on his summer european adventure with some persuasion of parents brian boarded a plane to head across the pond since that moment brian has been to europe  times visiting brother vincent and his family for the great oktoberfest celebration as well as various other countries on the odd years vincent has joined the whitemore family for hawaiian vacations thanksgiving dinners as well as various summer trips to the lakes of minnesota their relationship is truly a testament as to how small and great our world truly is alex jadin  groomsmanalex and brian met in  when brians sister and alex began dating that dating

they have continued to be close as they compete in fantasy football various golf outings as well as fishing adventures brian was fortunate enough to be a groomsman in ryans wedding over there years ryans competitive edge always came through i think he as a  bet on about everything including the infamous pool championships in high school where some of the more comical conversations and inside jokes discussed today originated kile lundy  groomsmankile is brians closest male cousin kile and brian have always had a lot in common including their love of sports and travel over the years brian and kile have adventured the mean streets of london where they tested all of the local beers at their favorite london hot spots of waxys waxys little sister and oneils there is also that unique story
