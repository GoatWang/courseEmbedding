products                list of products separation anxiety   over the years i have worked on and developed many versions of the classic effect out of this world in fact the first effect i ever released was called couples — a version of ootw that at the time paul curry stated was the best variation of his original that he had seen and offered to market it for me it was a most encouraging start to what has become a most interesting field of endeavor now these many years later i’ve finally developed an extremely straightforward handsoff twophase routine that utilizes deeply layered methods befitting this classic effect of mentalism watching the impact it has on both laymen and magiciansmentalists alike has convinced me it’s one of the most powerfully direct and clean presentations available via an ebooklet with embedded videos  you can also learn this most amazing of effects that slayed them when premiered at the prestigious meeting of the minds and has fooled some of the best minds in the business   here are a few unedited quotes barrie richardson  elegant the trick of the year doug dyment with separation anxiety bruce has taken a wellloved plot ootw added a dollop of ideas from others and then worked his wellknown magic streamlining the action removing the dead time and false actions clarifying the display simplifying the mechanics and topping the whole thing with a killer ending a tiny elegant masterpiece and one of the few card tricks i perform christopher carter when i first saw bruce bernstein perform separation anxiety i knew i had to learn it  it was the cleanest most direct handling of out of this world i had seen  i didn’t see how it could be improved upon  then bruce showed me the second phase and it was even more incredible than the first” few creators understand what mentalism should really look like in performance better than bruce   the first phase of separation anxiety is as perfect as any mental card effect could be  gone is the unusual procedure of most versions of paul curry’s classic effect   a spectator psychically separates a small back of cards into reds and blacks  that’s it  it’s that direct  but bruce doesn’t stop there  as soon as the spectator has picked her jaw up from the floor he has her do it again but this time with a twist so diabolical it just has to be seen to be believed i never thought i needed  another card effect in my repertoire until i saw separation anxiety now i know better it’s definitely going into my repertoire matthew field the magic circular paul curry’s “out of this world” is perhaps the most popular card trick ever  a problem with it is however that it is a tough sell to make it seem “psychic”  chicago mentalist and magician bruce bernstein spent years trying to come with a method which fit his persona and “separation anxiety” is it the spectator is handed a packet of  cards and told to deal them into two fairly equal piles but not haphazardly or simply alternating piles she is to “follow her intuition”  the wizard counts one of the piles and congratulates the spectator when the total is seen to be  ‒ precisely half the top card of one pile is turned over ‒ it is red  the top card of the other pile is black  several more cards are turned over in pairs ‒ again red in one pile black in the other the remainders of both piles are turned over showing a perfect separation as a followup the wonder worker removes an ace of spades from his pocket and states that he will make the spectator treat this card as red as he openly inserts it into the packet of cards and mixes them  again the cards are dealt into two piles one pile is shown to consist entirely of black cards the other of all red cards ‒ except for the ace of spades seen in the centre of the “red” pile as one would expect from bruce bernstein this is devilishly clever   might seem a bit expensive for a page pdf but the price is for the years of thinking that went into the method and the fact that the working mentalist will get a lot of mileage out of this  three brief videos are included illustrating a few of the fine points bob farmer bruce bernstein who has an honored place in my book as one of the premier sultans of swindle was selling a new trick separation anxiety which soundedlike a lot of bruces stuffcompletely impossible so i figuredlike a lot of bruces stuffthe method would be in the upper echelons of deviousnessand i just had to know how it worked because heres the effect you hand a spectator a small packet of ungaffed facedown cards you tell her to follow her intuition and deal the packet into two piles on the tablebut she is to deal the cards completely at random ie not back and forth in a regular manner but helter skelter she does so when the two piles are checked  there are exactly ten cards in each pile  she has somehow divided the ten red cards from the ten black cards this is about as clean and fast an out of this world effect as you can get bruce also provides a second phase different from the first which in effect is different enough to be interesting and in method relies on something the audience has understood from the first phase its  pages of unmitigated sneakiness and i highly recommend it to one and all  ross johnson bruce bernstein is in creative mode and has traveled to a new solar system on the heels of the ground breaking taboo comes a refined take on the always intriguing out of this world only the mind of bernstein can both simplify method and expand impact at the same time this is a routine not to be overlooked by any worker who presents miracles of only the highest quality alain nu bruce bernstein has been one of the most clever creators in the field of psychic entertainment and a true inspiration for many other artists such as myself bruce is like a scientist whose clever mind continues to search for the answers to the even greater mysteries behind the already great mysteries which we cherish in bernsteins separation anxiety you will find about the cleanest answer to paul currys out of this world to date recently while in chicago he showed it to me and it left me speechless it happens a lot faster than you would expect now is your chance to learn this quickly either before he changes his mind or i make him change his mind jheff’s marketplace of the mind  this is a lean direct powerful and easytodo version of the classic paul curry effect  and besides if youve read his landmark book  unreal you know that anything with bruce bernsteins name on it is sight  unseen wellworth getting  of course the plot which you probably know already involves the  participant amazingly separating red and black cards  this version  which only uses twenty cards is based on ideas from brad henderson and jon  armstrong who in turn based their work on ideas from martin gardner and  paul curry though not all of gardners and currys ideas are  in separation anxiety  it starts and ends clean and most definitely  can be done with a borrowed deck of cards and in impromptu situations   in fact its probably best for that  using twenty cards certainly solves the controversial issue of the  effect being too long  the entire stack is handed to the participant to  separate which makes this a very nice handsoff presentation  and the  cleanup is much cleaner and far less awkward than the usual manner in which  it is done for those familiar with jon armstrongs out of this blah blah  blah know that this was certainly bernsteins inspiration and starting  point but he has added some touches that take this effect into an entirely  new and different level  ill also note that bernstein includes a second variation which allows  for the effect to be repeated  it is rather amazing as it features a  powerful prediction thats quite a shocker to the layman  this is being sold as a  page downloadable pdf with some embedded  videos i know that this should be obvious but ill say it anyway this is  highly recommended   separation anxiety the effect in detail separation anxiety is available as a pdf with  short embedded videos to make the handling crystal clear sent as an email attachment – no

on mentalism or magic ive read in years jeff mcbride  ive just gone on tour and had  bliss filled days with your book  unreal  i love so many of the ideas too and have already started to work on a few jheffs marketplace of the mind   these are the facts bruce bernstein is one of the most creative thinkers in mentalism this book is a collection of most of his material also quite a bit of his material i have used still use or plan on using at some point in the future most everything in this book is classic stuff that professional mentalists the world over have been using for years such as eat at joes really besides whats already written in the blurb is there anything else that needs to be said oh yeah the book is gorgeous real linen hardcover  x   pages for those wondering what kind of mentalism effects that bernstein specializes in i think i can safely say that if you like the work of barrie richardson then youll like this one more thing i dont often say that something is a musthave but if anything released this year deserves that label this is it david britland  unreal contains nine chapters in all the remainder covering routines with money psychometry  variations of a routine involving time travel and a chapter on techniques that also details bruce’s centre tear interspersed between the chapters are essays on various aspects of mentalism from presentation and exposure to getting caught and the basic skills that every mentalist should have bruce bernstein is a clever fellow and it’s a pleasure to read the additions and twists he gives to many standard plots the routines are very practical inherently crafty and incorporate the kind of psychological touches that are increasingly part of contemporary mentalism the tricks have weathered the years well possibly because bruce was ahead of his time when he devised them taken together the variety of presentations methods techniques and good advice not only make the book a valuable source of ideas for the experienced performer but also a great first book for anyone who wants to try their hand at mentalism taboo   taboo is the first offering in a series of restricted releases aimed at the innerschool of psychic entertainers these manuscripts will only be available directly through me and will not be wholesaled to dealers my plan is to release materials over time that ive been holding back or that have been created recently that meet only the highest standards of which i am capable im proud to start these offerings with the release of taboo since i feel it represents some of my finest thinking and blazes new ground in psychic entertainment the concepts explained in this book will show you ways to reveal audience members deepest darkest secrets in an amazingly entertaining manner heres what i wrote in the introduction  taboo is a unique melding of concepts i’ve been working on for nearly a decade and is perhaps the most advanced routine of psychic entertainment i’ve ever created it would be wrong to just call taboo an effect it’s so much more than that let me also state as clearly as i can that taboo is only suitable for the boldest and most charismatic of performers this is not something to be done casually for some friends or as a demonstration of mental magic but that said even if you never perform the effect i believe that you’ll find there is much to be gleaned from my thinking about this presentation from the “cutting edge”another point i should make clear at the start is that taboo must be personalized and custom tailored to the particular performer who is brave and talented enough to tackle this presentation to expect a “one size fits all” script or approach is only asking for failure but with the techniques and variations i’ll be sharing in the book the right performer will have found his or her miracle  although i describe several variations on the theme in the book including the ultimate taboo which i created for my own personal use heres the basic plot several spectators are asked to join you onstage and are requested to think of things they have done or might do that would be considered taboo by most people you then start to read their thoughts all at the same time revealing facts and information in a way worthy of a soap opera or reality show even though they are asked to keep a poker face and not give you any hints about their secret taboo you are able to zero in more and more on each of their secret thoughts until it starts to become clear youre starting to figure out just which taboo each of them are thinking of then in the most incredible of climaxes each of them individually acknowledges time and time again  just how how accurate youve been in discovering their most personal of information ok  although that sounds incredible i know what youre thinking  even if that were possible which it is im sure youre thinking that this routine could easily cause embarrassment or discomfort to those participating but perhaps the most amazing part of the routine are the many psychological subtleties and powerful gambits i teach that will actually put them at ease and show them how to thoroughly enjoy their roles as the stars of the presentation michael weber  i believe two things about taboo to be true  bruce has crafted a routine which is both practical and powerful and   of the mentalists i have seen dont have the balls to present it the way it deserves to be performed christopher carter  bruce bernstein is a genius this fact is accepted by everybody who knows his work where others put out minor variations of popular and frequently over used themes bruce’s published effects consistently range from innovative to groundbreaking it’s not that he doesn’t draw inspiration from prior creators all creators do that what makes bruce’s work stand out are two things first he sees the potential in ideas that the rest of us breeze over without noticing second he combines these ideas in such a way that the result is vastly greater than the sum of the parts taboo is a perfect product of bruce’s devious mind within the method there are elements that we all will recognize but they are applied in combination to a devastating effect and what is that effect it’s practically the holy grail of mentalism when people find out that you’re a mind reader they worry that you’ll be able to divine their deepest most intimate secrets thanks to taboo you do exactly that amazingly bruce stages things so that you reveal their secrets in such a way that they will never be publicly embarrassed and yet there is no doubt that you have received impressions you really should not be able to know when bruce first shared his idea with me a few years ago i was delighted with its boldness and simplicity and i hoped to one day be able to do it since that time he has refined the routine and added subtleties that make it even stronger it ranks in my opinion among his best work i have one caveat about taboo the characteristic that makes bruce’s work stand out is that he understands the difference between mentalism and magic his best effects rely on subtle methods that require a bold and confident performance to pull off no sleights are required but you must be able to bluff with impunity because of this brilliance of taboo will probably go unrecognized by the beginning mentalist or mental magician that’s bad news for bruce in terms of product sales but great news for the rest of us those who study and perform this will have a miracle that i predict very few others will be doing jon stetson  taboo is too good  its bruces greatest creation to date at  this masterpiece is way underpriced for me it is worth thousands  i wish i could keep this one for myself thank goodness bruce uses his power for good ps for anyone wondering the difference between mentalism and mental magic buy taboo and find out   taboo is  pages and printed on high quality paper spiral bound with art quality covers featuring my custom calligraphy  taboo  cover art will power   i sincerely believe it to be original dramatic and as close to an actual demonstration of how material objects can be physically controlled by the power of the mind as may ever be developed you receive a  page booklet that breaks the routine down in detail along with those other special things youll need   banachek every mentalist or magician is looking for that holy grail of effects you know the one the one that looks impromptu the one that can be performed anywhere anytime close up cabaret or stage the one that can be whipped out for a newspaper story and become the center piece for the reporter to hang his words of astonishment upon   with bruce bernsteins contribution of will power that grail has been created for us  bruce has fabricated a brilliant routine with props that fit in your change pocket it really is that tiny but the impact and reactions are incredibly huge  the effect is non assuming yet grows with each stage of the routine the impossibilities stack up one on top of the other to create a wellchoreographed piece of theater that does not feel like theater it feels genuine  this is not mental magic it can not even be described as mentalism as that would not do it justice it appears to be a real feat of psychic power  but hey what would you expect from the mind of bruce bernstein nothing less  i will carry this with me  ken weber i was asked which effect was the hit of the psychic entertainers associations annual convention the meeting of the minds  while i loved many routines bruces will power stole the show it is a novel plot it builds and builds in its impossibility and it was presented brilliantly for me in terms of seeing something new and wonderful this was the winner let me add that if you simply read the description supplied on bruces website you will understandably assume that this is strictly a closeup effect its not i watched bruce perform the routine from many rows back and i can tell you that although i could not see anything happening in terms of the coins the sounds of the coins spinning on the plates as carried over the sound system lent this routine a dense layer of drama that added immensely to its effectiveness in other words this can be strong as a stage effect and yes it will be wonderful closeup as well larry becker ive thoroughly enjoyed using bruce bernsteins will power since i acquired it from bruce its a spell binding closeup effect that plays larger than life thanks to the intriguing musicality of the spinning coins and bruces entertaining routine ross johnson with will power bruce bernstein has produced a complete routine that is practical and actually doable as it stands not since ned rutledges minding the store has a performance piece been so thoroughly explained and analyzed for maximum impact every nuance is covered its impact is long lasting will power has become one of three bruce bernstein products that i will not leave home without   will power the effect in detail psideck my take on the famous “tossed out deck” but so diabolically clever it will fool anyone familiar with the original   max maven if machiavelli had wanted to do card mentalism he might have come up with something like bruce bernsteins psideck  but he probably wouldnt have had the patience to make the gaffs   larry becker unreservedly recommended outstandinga beautiful product     craig karges with a combination of principles and an ingeniously constructed deck bruce has put together a wonderful routine with psideck it is inexplicable and what mentalism with cards should look like  simple direct and baffling   ford kross regular readers of mine are aware of my antipathy to card tricks so if i rave about one i must really be impressed such is the case with bruce bernsteins psideck   dave hoys tossedout deck is already a classic but imagine this improvement a deck of cards is fanned and shown to appear normal three participants are freely selected as in hoys classic a rubberbanded deck of cards is given to  he looks at one card the same deck is given to  same procedure you are able to name the cards looked at and even tell who has which unlike hoys effect they have different cards with the third participant you remove an envelope and place it in sight the slowly dealing from the same deck on to the table you ask them to tell you when to stop after the chosen card is shown they open the envelope and reveal that youve correctly predicted it as you might think this is not an ordinary deck bruce has produced a beautiful gimmicked deck that is extremely versatile   richard busch author of peek performances psideck is beyond my inadequate words altogether after two participants each hold the cards themselves  and each peek a card a card is cleanly dealt that matches a premonition that was in plain view beforehand you can instantly name both peeked cards and hit on the premonition no switching no switching predictions no switching anything i mean nothing if this isnt stunning and direct then i dont know what is considering the incredible unbelievable time consuming workmanship involved in this creation bruces decks are well worth the investment more psideck is available in  different versions so you may repeat the effect for the same audience without the same selections being made   to read a detailed description of the effect just click on psideck the effect in detail   a single psideck sells for  the  deck set sells for  altered   my version of what is perhaps the greatest force deck of all times  the monte cristo deck  i produced a small run of these at the same time psidecks were made i have never advertised or wholesaled these decks and will not be making more when the stock is gonethey have the same mermaid backs only available in blue and are made from the same high quality casino card stock in addition to the deck itself additional gimmicked cards are supplied that will allow you to perform some powerful routines not possible with the force deck alone since it forces the  of clubs it is the perfect deck to use in my bernsteins bet routine described in my book unreal altered additional effects in detail   bernstein linking pins routine   an incredible four phase routine that you will use includes the two three inch safety pins a dvd with the routine and full explanation and a  x  poster no page turning with props in hand with seventeen line drawings to make learning easy all pins purchased directly from me are personally double checked and tested before shipping barrie richardson bruce bernsteins linking pin routine is one of the most astonishing and entertaining effects on this planet  period   hank moorehouse from a to z  the best linking pin routine ive ever seen  bruce barnett i liked bruces linking pin routine this is a routine where large safety pins link and unlink in slow motion there is a finale and at the end  the pins are passed out for examination no switch even when i knew the principle he fooled me with it phil wilmarth linking ring here is a superb four part routine the final phase is a wonderful visual unlinking of a spectators finger ring from a pin as a separate pin immediately links to the very same pin the ring just left bruce also explains how to pass the pins out for examination upon completion of the routine without switches its a fooler of a routine yet is not that difficult to do please email me for shipping and handling charges i accept paypal to the following email address or checkmo   for

marshall’s famous magic inc in chicago for almost  years bruce either lectured andor performed at all of tony andruzzi’s legendary “invocationals” and received the psychic entertainer’s association’s

the “mindvention” in addition to his onstage appearances he serves as a consultant and has developed material for some of the biggest names in the field here are a few quotes jeff mcbride “your lectures are fabulous” jon stetson bruce bernstein is a genius he didn’t pay me to say this  in fact i paid him after having had the opportunity to see bruce lecture and reading his wonderful books i hired bruce as a consultant we have worked on several projects and will continue to work together as long as i have a say in the matter anyone involved with any form of mystery entertainment must spend an evening at a bruce bernstein lecture  bruce is one clever fellow a tremendous teacher and one heck of a great guy no matter what type of magicmentalism that may be your particular field of

that will amaze our audiences i perform two bernstein effects in my own repertoire and i never fail to astound people with them dont pass up and opportunity to hear bruce bernstein lecture max maven bruce starts with offbeat ideas and then takes them further than youd expect with great results stephen minch bruce bernstein has devised some of the most diabolical conceits in modern mentalism when he talks i listen  really carefully luke jermay “bruce is without a doubt one of mentalism’s greatest thinkers  he subtle attention to detail takes what in others hands could have been mere tricks and turns them into fully formed miracles i only meet bruce recently and yet i felt as if i had known him for years i think this may be down to the fact that bruce also excels at a skill many mentalists do not in bruces writings you find passion and soul after reading his work i felt i knew him  his attention to detail does not go amiss in his writing either you can be sure when you buy a book with bernstein on the cover you are getting the complete and real work on the effects within with effects such as perception is everything which i think is probably the first application of its method in mentalism at such a high level and has spurred on many including myself to create effects using its conceptual teaching and the ritual which is probably as close to mind control as any one could wish to get his emergency mentalism shows his ability to create material for the real worker and has personally saved me on more than one occasion i could cite material from bruces prolific output and explain exactly why i love them so much  but would rather you begin your own journey into this amazing mentalist’s mind and begin to ask yourself why you love this material as much as me and i have not even started on his brilliant centre tear yet i feel honoured to be asked to comment on material this good  i can only hope that i one day create something as brilliant as bruces material  do yourself a favor and hand him a check for everything he puts out and do not miss out on anything he writes  you will be sorry if you do john luka bruce lectured for our group at the magic shop in garden city michigan last night the lecture was  he was magnificent this definitely ranks with the top lectures i have seen in the past few years bruce obviously enjoys lecturing it certainly showed no one left the lecture dissatisfied  if you have the opportunity to attend bruces lecture be sure you do or better yet contact bruce and arrange to have him lecture for your group youll be glad you did bruce barnett moderator of the eg there are  traits that i look for impact and entertainment i look for material that allows me to have fun with the audience last night i saw bruce bernsteins lecture every routine i saw him perform has been added to my list the nice thing about his routines is the versatility take psychout this can be used by gamblers mentalists card experts or bizzarrists im going to have fun with this routine i liked bruces linking pins routine even when i knew the principle he fooled me with it couples is baffling to magicians and non magicians this is a trait that most of bruces routines have devious might be the better word he fooled me many times every routine is well constructed strong baffling and suitable to a wide variety of venues highly recommended marc desouza i just wanted to thank you for the incredible lecture you gave at my home truly something for everyone your theories on mentalism were thought provoking to say the least the center tear is one of the best most practical handlings i have seen i was only sorry that you taught psychout its too good and i wanted to keep it for myself it is certainly a routine to be added to my working repertoire lee earle there are very few lecturers who pack as much value into a lecture as does bruce bernstein this is a performer who knows what he is talking about and is one of those rare individuals who thinks anyone who attends his lecture and doesnt come away with a headfull of clever practical no nonsense material just wasnt paying attention if youre booked to perform on the night bruce is scheduled to lecture give the gig to your competition you wont regret it gary kurtz bruce bernstein through his books on mentalism has long been an inspiration to me his lecture is filled with strong usable effects accomplished by devious working man methods definitely see his lecture if you have a chance bruce has two different lectures and also offers an indepth mentalism workshop done in the traditional teachin style for a limited number of attendees lee marelli president of the psiclones and for the mile high magicians society  the attendees commented most favorably on your lecture and would certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to host your lecture as to the mentalism workshop the psiclone members who attended immensely benefited from it the workshop was truly a working session for those who are serious about mentalism in summary both your lecture and workshop is a tribute to your professionalism creativity and ability to teach there is no doubt you are a star in the world of mentalism for more information please email brucembernsteinsbcglobalnet click here for product information will power details             will power  the effect in detail effect “i’ve often wondered if the future is something that only can be sensed or if perhaps the future can somehow be influenced by the will a few months ago i stumbled upon an experiment that has shaped my opinion on that very concept” you continue by explaining that coins were selected as the “equipment” in the experiment since they are easily available consistent from one to the next and have a  –  chance of being either “heads” or “tails” you proceed to describe the four ways a selection can be made…”i realized that a coin can be either flipped spun shaken or deliberately turned over ” part  a wide shallow bowl which may be opaque or clear and a dinner plate with a bunch of pocket change on it are introduced the coins are dumped out onto the table as you say “when the idea first struck me that it might actually be possible to affect the future i decided that a spinning coin would likely be one of the easiest things to affect by the mind alone at first i had some successes but very minor and at best statistical in nature then one day i discovered the following procedure which i’m finding increasingly interesting the more i try it” as you slide two nickels mid table you continue “i’d place two coins in front of me just like this… one coin ‘heads’ up the other coin ‘tails’ up” “then i’d let my mind settle on one of them for example “heads” while keeping that image in my mind as best i could i’d take the other coin and give it a good spin inside of a bowl… just like this” the nickel is held vertically with the first finger of one hand then flicked with the finger of the other hand “if i felt the image fading at all i’d look at the actual coin on the table to help reinforce the visualization i’ve found that employing a firm and focused visualization to be a powerful aid in helping to achieve the consistent results i’ve been able to achieve in this experiment” when the coin comes to rest it is seen to be “heads” up as well you remove the coin from the bowl and place it back as it originally was next to the “chosen” nickel you explain that “after much experimentation i’ve found that nickels seem to work best for this as they seem to be the most balanced of all the various coins” the procedure is repeated only this time with the other coin you then repeat the same procedure for a third time with either coin only this time you place the plate on top of the bowl while the coin is spinning so as to “eliminate any physical influence that you might be unwittingly exerting” not only does this make sense as a way of “isolating” the coin but the drama garnered by hearing the coin spinning and then slowly falling over is a highlight of this routine when you hear the coin come to rest the plate is removed and again the coins match “so far a coincidence at best but still quite interesting” now you ask an audience member to give it a go both nickels are slid back mid table she is asked to let her mind settle on either the “heads” up or the “tails” up nickel and then tell you her choice you ask her to concentrate on her choice as you pick up the nonchosen nickel and give it a good spin in the bowl as before when the plate is removed the coins are seen to match again after this is repeated once more you state some people might think that “somehow i’m affecting the outcome in how i spin the coin since i’m are aware of her selection” so you turn your head ask her to think of one of them and then cover it with her hand she is then to drop the other coin on your outstretched palm while your head is turned so you can’t know if it was the “heads” up or the “tails” up coin she is to concentrate on her “selection” without letting anyone else see what it is as you spin the coin she handed you in the bowl only after you spin the coin is she to say if her selection was “heads” or “tails” once more when the plate is removed the coins are seen to match now she is to try it all on her own without any help from you this time she is to be the only one who is to know what her choice is she is to remain silent until the nickel that you spin in the bowl comes to rest you turn your head ask her to think of one of them and then cover it with her hand as before she is to then drop the other coin on your outstretched palm while your head is turned so you can’t know if it was the “heads” up or “tails” up coin when the plate is removed the coins are seen to match yet again now that it’s becoming clear that something extraordinary is happening you state “perhaps someone here might be thinking that somehow psychology may be affecting her choice of either ‘heads’ or ’tails’” to totally disprove this idea you ask the person to remove the coin from the bowl and flip it into the air apparently removing any possible influence over the choice of either “heads” or “tails” this is the “classic” thumb flip into the air catching the coin with the same hand that flipped it which then places the coin on the back of the other hand without looking as in a sporting event she is asked to reveal if the coin is “heads” or “tails” for example it’s “heads” up you smile and say “that’s what i hoped would happen” as you give the nickel in front of you a spin in the bowl you quickly grab another nickel from the pile of change which you flip into the air and catch with the same hand that flipped it but instead of placing it on to the back of your other hand you slam your hand palm down on the table keeping the flipped nickel concealed underneath it as the spinning coin comes to rest when the nickel in the bowl falls over it is seen to also be “heads” up you dramatically lift your hand from over the third nickel and it too is seen to have landed “heads” up part  “since we’ve just utilized the ‘spin’ and the ‘flip’ let’s try the ‘deliberate selection’ technique and we’ll see if we can somehow influence the outcomes again” you slide a penny nickel dime and quarter over to your participant you ask her to carefully follow the instructions you are about to give her she is instructed to turn one and only one coin over each time you tell her to do so she may change which coin she turns over each time or she may turn over the same coin repeatedly in any combination she wishes in other words she has a completely free choice over which coin she turns over and in what order the coins are chosen you will have her do this a number of times so that the coins will end up in an apparently random pattern of “heads” and “tails” you then turn away so that you can’t see what coins she is turning over you are seen to be “keeping track” of how you’re trying to influence her choices using your own set of four “invisible” coins which you mime turning over one at a time on the palm of your hand each time you instruct her to turn one of her real coins over obviously no one could know which coins or even how many there are that are either “heads” up or “tails” up she is then to randomly cover any one of the coins with her hand concealing it from view you turn back around and after “comparing the state of your invisible coins” to the ones of hers that are still visible you state that if all went as you willed it to the coin under her hand is for example “tails” up… and it is you repeat this sequence several times each time you vary the amount of coins she is to turn over yet you still correctly identify whether her concealed coin is “heads” up or “tails” up part  “ok by now i hope i’m ‘warmed up’ enough for the most difficult process to affect of all…’random shaking’” she is asked to gather up her four coins as you demonstrate using a few of the remaining coins how she is to hold and then shake the coins between her cupped hands at your request she is to let the coins drop on to the table causing some to land “heads” up and some to land “tails” up in what would seem to be a totally random manner once the procedure is understood an envelope is shown and placed down in full view “in this envelope are a couple of seemingly random outcomes that i’m going to attempt to influence” you then ask her “which would you rather start with ‘heads’ or ‘tails’” for example she answers “tails” you say “ok we’ll work with ‘tails’ first and use ‘heads’ next time” she is to pick up and shake her four coins then when you say “now” drop them to the table as previously instructed since she selected “tails” you instruct her to keep any coins that land “tails” up and push any coins that landed “heads” up off to the side she is then to pick up only the coins that fell “tails” up and do the “shake and drop” as before again eliminating any coins that landed “heads” up this “shake and drop” procedure is repeated until only one coin remains “tails” up let’s say that her remaining coin was a quarter you request all present to remember the last “tails” up coin was a quarter you seem satisfied with the outcome so as you say “let’s make it a bit harder this time” you push a bunch more coins over to her with which she is to repeat the previous procedure but this time she is to keep any coins that land “heads” up and eliminate any coins that land “tails” up as before this is repeated until only one coin remains the last remaining “heads” up coin is seen to be a nickel you open the envelope and hand her the contents to read out loud it reads “the last ‘tails’ up coin will be a quarter and the last ‘heads’ up coin will be a nickel”  by bruce bernstein chicago il all rights reserved for more information please email brucembernsteinsbcglobalnet back to products back to lecture services products                list of products separation anxiety   over the years i have worked on and developed many versions of the classic effect out of this world in fact the first effect i ever released was called couples — a version of ootw that at the time paul curry stated was the best variation of his original that he had seen and offered to market it for me it was a most encouraging start to what has become a most interesting field of endeavor now these many years later i’ve finally developed an extremely straightforward handsoff twophase routine that utilizes deeply layered methods befitting this classic effect of mentalism watching the impact it has on both laymen and magiciansmentalists alike has convinced me it’s one of the most powerfully direct and clean presentations available via an ebooklet with embedded videos  you can also learn this most amazing of effects that slayed them when premiered at the prestigious meeting of the minds and has fooled some of the best minds in the business   here are a few unedited quotes barrie richardson  elegant the trick of the year doug dyment with separation anxiety bruce has taken a wellloved plot ootw added a dollop of ideas from others and then worked his wellknown magic streamlining the action removing the dead time and false actions clarifying the display simplifying the mechanics and topping the whole thing with a killer ending a tiny elegant masterpiece and one of the few card tricks i perform christopher carter when i first saw bruce bernstein perform separation anxiety i knew i had to learn it  it was the cleanest most direct handling of out of this world i had seen  i didn’t see how it could be improved upon  then bruce showed me the second phase and it was even more incredible than the first” few creators understand what mentalism should really look like in performance better than bruce   the first phase of separation anxiety is as perfect as any mental card effect could be  gone is the unusual procedure of most versions of paul curry’s classic effect   a spectator psychically separates a small back of cards into reds and blacks  that’s it  it’s that direct  but bruce doesn’t stop there  as soon as the spectator has picked her jaw up from the floor he has her do it again but this time with a twist so diabolical it just has to be seen to be believed i never thought i needed  another card effect in my repertoire until i saw separation anxiety now i know better it’s definitely going into my repertoire matthew field the magic circular paul curry’s “out of this world” is perhaps the most popular card trick ever  a problem with it is however that it is a tough sell to make it seem “psychic”  chicago mentalist and magician bruce bernstein spent years trying to come with a method which fit his persona and “separation anxiety” is it the spectator is handed a packet of  cards and told to deal them into two fairly equal piles but not haphazardly or simply alternating piles she is to “follow her intuition”  the wizard counts one of the piles and congratulates the spectator when the total is seen to be  ‒ precisely half the top card of one pile is turned over ‒ it is red  the top card of the other pile is black  several more cards are turned over in pairs ‒ again red in one pile black in the other the remainders of both piles are turned over showing a perfect separation as a followup the wonder worker removes an ace of spades from his pocket and states that he will make the spectator treat this card as red as he openly inserts it into the packet of cards and mixes them  again the cards are dealt into two piles one pile is shown to consist entirely of black cards the other of all red cards ‒ except for the ace of spades seen in the centre of the “red” pile as one would expect from bruce bernstein this is devilishly clever   might seem a bit expensive for a page pdf but the price is for the years of thinking that went into the method and the fact that the working mentalist will get a lot of mileage out of this  three brief videos are included illustrating a few of the fine points bob farmer bruce bernstein who has an honored place in my book as one of the premier sultans of swindle was selling a new trick separation anxiety which soundedlike a lot of bruces stuffcompletely impossible so i figuredlike a lot of bruces stuffthe method would be in the upper echelons of deviousnessand i just had to know how it worked because heres the effect you hand a spectator a small packet of ungaffed facedown cards you tell her to follow her intuition and deal the packet into two piles on the tablebut she is to deal the cards completely at random ie not back and forth in a regular manner but helter skelter she does so when the two piles are checked  there are exactly ten cards in each pile  she has somehow divided the ten red cards from the ten black cards this is about as clean and fast an out of this world effect as you can get bruce also provides a second phase different from the first which in effect is different enough to be interesting and in method relies on something the audience has understood from the first phase its  pages of unmitigated sneakiness and i highly recommend it to one and all  ross johnson bruce bernstein is in creative mode and has traveled to a new solar system on the heels of the ground breaking taboo comes a refined take on the always intriguing out of this world only the mind of bernstein can both simplify method and expand impact at the same time this is a routine not to be overlooked by any worker who presents miracles of only the highest quality alain nu bruce bernstein has been one of the most clever creators in the field of psychic entertainment and a true inspiration for many other artists such as myself bruce is like a scientist whose clever mind continues to search for the answers to the even greater mysteries behind the already great mysteries which we cherish in bernsteins separation anxiety you will find about the cleanest answer to paul currys out of this world to date recently while in chicago he showed it to me and it left me speechless it happens a lot faster than you would expect now is your chance to learn this quickly either before he changes his mind or i make him change his mind jheff’s marketplace of the mind  this is a lean direct powerful and easytodo version of the classic paul curry effect  and besides if youve read his landmark book  unreal you know that anything with bruce bernsteins name on it is sight  unseen wellworth getting  of course the plot which you probably know already involves the  participant amazingly separating red and black cards  this version  which only uses twenty cards is based on ideas from brad henderson and jon  armstrong who in turn based their work on ideas from martin gardner and  paul curry though not all of gardners and currys ideas are  in separation anxiety  it starts and ends clean and most definitely  can be done with a borrowed deck of cards and in impromptu situations   in fact its probably best for that  using twenty cards certainly solves the controversial issue of the  effect being too long  the entire stack is handed to the participant to  separate which makes this a very nice handsoff presentation  and the  cleanup is much cleaner and far less awkward than the usual manner in which  it is done for those familiar with jon armstrongs out of this blah blah  blah know that this was certainly bernsteins inspiration and starting  point but he has added some touches that take this effect into an entirely  new and different level  ill also note that bernstein includes a second variation which allows  for the effect to be repeated  it is rather amazing as it features a  powerful prediction thats quite a shocker to the layman  this is being sold as a  page downloadable pdf with some embedded  videos i know that this should be obvious but ill say it anyway this is  highly recommended

on mentalism or magic ive read in years jeff mcbride  ive just gone on tour and had  bliss filled days with your book  unreal  i love so many of the ideas too and have already started to work on a few jheffs marketplace of the mind   these are the facts bruce bernstein is one of the most creative thinkers in mentalism this book is a collection of most of his material also quite a bit of his material i have used still use or plan on using at some point in the future most everything in this book is classic stuff that professional mentalists the world over have been using for years such as eat at joes really besides whats already written in the blurb is there anything else that needs to be said oh yeah the book is gorgeous real linen hardcover  x   pages for those wondering what kind of mentalism effects that bernstein specializes in i think i can safely say that if you like the work of barrie richardson then youll like this one more thing i dont often say that something is a musthave but if anything released this year deserves that label this is it david britland  unreal contains nine chapters in all the remainder covering routines with money psychometry  variations of a routine involving time travel and a chapter on techniques that also details bruce’s centre tear interspersed between the chapters are essays on various aspects of mentalism from presentation and exposure to getting caught and the basic skills that every mentalist should have bruce bernstein is a clever fellow and it’s a pleasure to read the additions and twists he gives to many standard plots the routines are very practical inherently crafty and incorporate the kind of psychological touches that are increasingly part of contemporary mentalism the tricks have weathered the years well possibly because bruce was ahead of his time when he devised them taken together the variety of presentations methods techniques and good advice not only make the book a valuable source of ideas for the experienced performer but also a great first book for anyone who wants to try their hand at mentalism taboo   taboo is the first offering in a series of restricted releases aimed at the innerschool of psychic entertainers these manuscripts will only be available directly through me and will not be wholesaled to dealers my plan is to release materials over time that ive been holding back or that have been created recently that meet only the highest standards of which i am capable im proud to start these offerings with the release of taboo since i feel it represents some of my finest thinking and blazes new ground in psychic entertainment the concepts explained in this book will show you ways to reveal audience members deepest darkest secrets in an amazingly entertaining manner heres what i wrote in the introduction  taboo is a unique melding of concepts i’ve been working on for nearly a decade and is perhaps the most advanced routine of psychic entertainment i’ve ever created it would be wrong to just call taboo an effect it’s so much more than that let me also state as clearly as i can that taboo is only suitable for the boldest and most charismatic of performers this is not something to be done casually for some friends or as a demonstration of mental magic but that said even if you never perform the effect i believe that you’ll find there is much to be gleaned from my thinking about this presentation from the “cutting edge”another point i should make clear at the start is that taboo must be personalized and custom tailored to the particular performer who is brave and talented enough to tackle this presentation to expect a “one size fits all” script or approach is only asking for failure but with the techniques and variations i’ll be sharing in the book the right performer will have found his or her miracle  although i describe several variations on the theme in the book including the ultimate taboo which i created for my own personal use heres the basic plot several spectators are asked to join you onstage and are requested to think of things they have done or might do that would be considered taboo by most people you then start to read their thoughts all at the same time revealing facts and information in a way worthy of a soap opera or reality show even though they are asked to keep a poker face and not give you any hints about their secret taboo you are able to zero in more and more on each of their secret thoughts until it starts to become clear youre starting to figure out just which taboo each of them are thinking of then in the most incredible of climaxes each of them individually acknowledges time and time again  just how how accurate youve been in discovering their most personal of information ok  although that sounds incredible i know what youre thinking  even if that were possible which it is im sure youre thinking that this routine could easily cause embarrassment or discomfort to those participating but perhaps the most amazing part of the routine are the many psychological subtleties and powerful gambits i teach that will actually put them at ease and show them how to thoroughly enjoy their roles as the stars of the presentation michael weber  i believe two things about taboo to be true  bruce has crafted a routine which is both practical and powerful and   of the mentalists i have seen dont have the balls to present it the way it deserves to be performed christopher carter  bruce bernstein is a genius this fact is accepted by everybody who knows his work where others put out minor variations of popular and frequently over used themes bruce’s published effects consistently range from innovative to groundbreaking it’s not that he doesn’t draw inspiration from prior creators all creators do that what makes bruce’s work stand out are two things first he sees the potential in ideas that the rest of us breeze over without noticing second he combines these ideas in such a way that the result is vastly greater than the sum of the parts taboo is a perfect product of bruce’s devious mind within the method there are elements that we all will recognize but they are applied in combination to a devastating effect and what is that effect it’s practically the holy grail of mentalism when people find out that you’re a mind reader they worry that you’ll be able to divine their deepest most intimate secrets thanks to taboo you do exactly that amazingly bruce stages things so that you reveal their secrets in such a way that they will never be publicly embarrassed and yet there is no doubt that you have received impressions you really should not be able to know when bruce first shared his idea with me a few years ago i was delighted with its boldness and simplicity and i hoped to one day be able to do it since that time he has refined the routine and added subtleties that make it even stronger it ranks in my opinion among his best work i have one caveat about taboo the characteristic that makes bruce’s work stand out is that he understands the difference between mentalism and magic his best effects rely on subtle methods that require a bold and confident performance to pull off no sleights are required but you must be able to bluff with impunity because of this brilliance of taboo will probably go unrecognized by the beginning mentalist or mental magician that’s bad news for bruce in terms of product sales but great news for the rest of us those who study and perform this will have a miracle that i predict very few others will be doing jon stetson  taboo is too good  its bruces greatest creation to date at  this masterpiece is way underpriced for me it is worth thousands  i wish i could keep this one for myself thank goodness bruce uses his power for good ps for anyone wondering the difference between mentalism and mental magic buy taboo and find out   taboo is  pages and printed on high quality paper spiral bound with art quality covers featuring my custom calligraphy  taboo  cover art will power   i sincerely believe it to be original dramatic and as close to an actual demonstration of how material objects can be physically controlled by the power of the mind as may ever be developed you receive a  page booklet that breaks the routine down in detail along with those other special things youll need   banachek every mentalist or magician is looking for that holy grail of effects you know the one the one that looks impromptu the one that can be performed anywhere anytime close up cabaret or stage the one that can be whipped out for a newspaper story and become the center piece for the reporter to hang his words of astonishment upon   with bruce bernsteins contribution of will power that grail has been created for us  bruce has fabricated a brilliant routine with props that fit in your change pocket it really is that tiny but the impact and reactions are incredibly huge  the effect is non assuming yet grows with each stage of the routine the impossibilities stack up one on top of the other to create a wellchoreographed piece of theater that does not feel like theater it feels genuine  this is not mental magic it can not even be described as mentalism as that would not do it justice it appears to be a real feat of psychic power  but hey what would you expect from the mind of bruce bernstein nothing less  i will carry this with me  ken weber i was asked which effect was the hit of the psychic entertainers associations annual convention the meeting of the minds  while i loved many routines bruces will power stole the show it is a novel plot it builds and builds in its impossibility and it was presented brilliantly for me in terms of seeing something new and wonderful this was the winner let me add that if you simply read the description supplied on bruces website you will understandably assume that this is strictly a closeup effect its not i watched bruce perform the routine from many rows back and i can tell you that although i could not see anything happening in terms of the coins the sounds of the coins spinning on the plates as carried over the sound system lent this routine a dense layer of drama that added immensely to its effectiveness in other words this can be strong as a stage effect and yes it will be wonderful closeup as well larry becker ive thoroughly enjoyed using bruce bernsteins will power since i acquired it from bruce its a spell binding closeup effect that plays larger than life thanks to the intriguing musicality of the spinning coins and bruces entertaining routine ross johnson with will power bruce bernstein has produced a complete routine that is practical and actually doable as it stands not since ned rutledges minding the store has a performance piece been so thoroughly explained and analyzed for maximum impact every nuance is covered its impact is long lasting will power has become one of three bruce bernstein products that i will not leave home without   will power the effect in detail psideck my take on the famous “tossed out deck” but so diabolically clever it will fool anyone familiar with the original   max maven if machiavelli had wanted to do card mentalism he might have come up with something like bruce bernsteins psideck  but he probably wouldnt have had the patience to make the gaffs   larry becker unreservedly recommended outstandinga beautiful product     craig karges with a combination of principles and an ingeniously constructed deck bruce has put together a wonderful routine with psideck it is inexplicable and what mentalism with cards should look like  simple direct and baffling   ford kross regular readers of mine are aware of my antipathy to card tricks so if i rave about one i must really be impressed such is the case with bruce bernsteins psideck   dave hoys tossedout deck is already a classic but imagine this improvement a deck of cards is fanned and shown to appear normal three participants are freely selected as in hoys classic a rubberbanded deck of cards is given to  he looks at one card the same deck is given to  same procedure you are able to name the cards looked at and even tell who has which unlike hoys effect they have different cards with the third participant you remove an envelope and place it in sight the slowly dealing from the same deck on to the table you ask them to tell you when to stop after the chosen card is shown they open the envelope and reveal that youve correctly predicted it as you might think this is not an ordinary deck bruce has produced a beautiful gimmicked deck that is extremely versatile   richard busch author of peek performances psideck is beyond my inadequate words altogether after two participants each hold the cards themselves  and each peek a card a card is cleanly dealt that matches a premonition that was in plain view beforehand you can instantly name both peeked cards and hit on the premonition no switching no switching predictions no switching anything i mean nothing if this isnt stunning and direct then i dont know what is considering the incredible unbelievable time consuming workmanship involved in this creation bruces decks are well worth the investment more psideck is available in  different versions so you may repeat the effect for the same audience without the same selections being made   to read a detailed description of the effect just click on psideck the effect in detail   a single psideck sells for  the  deck set sells for  altered   my version of what is perhaps the greatest force deck of all times  the monte cristo deck  i produced a small run of these at the same time psidecks were made i have never advertised or wholesaled these decks and will not be making more when the stock is gonethey have the same mermaid backs only available in blue and are made from the same high quality casino card stock in addition to the deck itself additional gimmicked cards are supplied that will allow you to perform some powerful routines not possible with the force deck alone since it forces the  of clubs it is the perfect deck to use in my bernsteins bet routine described in my book unreal altered additional effects in detail   bernstein linking pins routine   an incredible four phase routine that you will use includes the two three inch safety pins a dvd with the routine

closeup msrp not enforced brand fun inc share thisemailfacebookpinterestgoogle description honed to perfection over nearly three decades the bernstein linking pin routine is as sharp and mystifying an effect as you will ever see the magician links two large safety pins together fairly and plainly on his command the pins visibly and slowly melt apart the unlinking of the pins actually looks like trick photography the effect is repeated – the pins unlink again – and the illusion looks just as baffling as it did the first time the pins are then caused to magically link together in a seemingly impossible manner one moment the two are separate and the next they are linked finally an ungimmicked finger ring is legitimately locked onto one of the pins despite the fairness of the proceedings the ring melts off of the pin it was locked on at the same moment the two pins link together in full view inches from the spectatorsat the conclusion of the routine everything can be examined there’s nothing to findthe bernstein linking pin routine requires no specially manufactured gaffs and no complicated sleightofhand nothing is switched in or out all that’s required are the two pins and a finger ring there are no external gimmicks it’s ready any time included inside are all necessary props and media two specially selected and handadjusted threeinch safety pins a broadcastquality instructional dvd featuring bernstein’s performance and explanation and a ″x″ poster no page turning required with clear line drawings to make learning easywords from those who know…hank moorehouse “from a to z – the best linking pin routine i’ve ever seen”phil wilmarth “here is a superb fourpart routine… the final phase is a wonderful visual unlinking of a spectator’s finger ring from a pin as a separate pin immediately links to the very same pin the ring just left bruce also explains how to pass the pins out for examination upon completion of the routine without switches it’s a fooler of a routine yet is no that difficult to do”barrie richardson “bruce bernstein’s linking pin routine is one of the most astonishing and entertaining effects on this planet – period” related products
