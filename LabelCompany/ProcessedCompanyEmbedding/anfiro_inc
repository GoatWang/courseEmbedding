tomorrow your custom text here current ro membranes are inefficientas water traverses an ro membrane it must do so through the many apertures within the porous structure in conventional polyamide ro membranes these pores are a chaotic mesh of interconnected passages that twist and turn throughout the membrane this type of structure provides a lot of resistance to the passage of water molecules across the membrane and the net result is low permeability membranes that require a high operating pressure anfiros membrane technologyour membranes create a nanoscale porous pattern of cylindrical pores that go straight through the membrane selective layer with minimal poretopore size variability the result is a massive increase in permeability without sacrificing selectivity performance anfiros selfassembling polymer technology is enabling a new generation of energyefficient membranes that can significantly reduce the operational and capital costs of an ro systemchlorine is one of the most widely used water disinfectants yet current ro membranes are permanently damaged when exposed to chlorine unlike current membrane technology anfiros polymer materials are not degraded by exposure to chlorine this enables chlorine to be used throughout the ro stage which reduces biofouling and can lead to a longer membrane lifespan   anfiro inc partners — anfiro menu street address
