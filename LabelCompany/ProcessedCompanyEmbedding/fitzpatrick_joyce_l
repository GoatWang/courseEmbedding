fitzpatricks life perspective rhythm model fitzpatrick presented a rhythm model for the field of inquiry for nursing a developmental model that proposes that the process of human development is characterized by rhythms the person is treated as an open holistic rhythmic system that can be described by indices of holistic human functioning as temporal motion consciousness and perceptual patterns fitzpatrick has asserted that the four indices of human functioning are intricately related to health patterns throughout the life span and these indices are rhythmic in nature differences in behavioral manifestations are more easily identified during the peaks and troughs of particular human rhythms throughout the developmental process there are patterns within a pattern or overall life patterns life’s pattern continues toward timelessness becoming more dominant as one’s development occurs meaning is viewed as the central component of the human experience and is necessary to enhance and maintain life fitzpatrick incorporated rogers’  postulated correlates of human development as the basis for differentiation organizing and ordering life’s reality rogers’ correlates of shorter higher frequency waves that manifest shorter rhythms and approach as seemingly continuous pattern serve as fitzpatrick’s foci for hypothesizing the existence of rhythmic patternsaccording to jl pressler in fitzpatrick’s rhythm model “nursing as a noun was described as a developing discipline whose central concern is the meaning attached to life death as a verb nursing or nursing activity was said to be focused on enhancing the developmental process toward health so that individuals may be led to develop their potentials as human beings” primary purpose of nursing is the promotion and maintenance of an optimal level of wellnessnursingfull transcriptmore presentations by jan kaela magallano group vital signshealth projectpopular presentationssee more popular or the latest
