would become doheny state beach  the pier and the capistrano beach clubhouse in the distance were built by ned doheny for his development of capistrano beach estates a town he hoped would rival and surpass in prestige the developing village of san clemente to the south  these structures are now long gone but great stories about them live on  the pier is where today’s south day use area ends and the county parking lot begins doheny and san cemente state beaches were build by the civilian conservation corp ccc a “new deal” program under the franklin roosevelt administration  by  ccc workers

the butterflies so thick one couldn’t see the green of the leaves  unfortunately most of the trees were removed because of disease or because they became a safety hazard and new state park regulations prevented the planting of new trees as eucalyptus are not a native to the southern california environment doheny’s th anniversary on june   doheny state beach recognized its th anniversary with a
