bearish funds in focus as equities finally pull back may   pm nysehdge bearish days in the market which are far and few in between these days remind us of actively managed “bear” etfs in the marketplace that tend to shine during such periods we have profiled hdge advisorshares ranger equity bear expense ratio   million in aum in the past in this column with the fund having debuted back in early  and the etf is substantially off of its early  highs where we see it trading at high as  it has a  handle currently yeartodate hdge has seen modest inflows of about  million and has noticeably experienced a run here since late april it traded at a week low of  seventeen trading sessions ago but has bounced more than  since to present levels hdge is a shortsale oriented equity only strategy not employing futures in order to be bearish on the market and fund literature states the following “the portfolio manager implements a bottomup fundamental research driven security selection process in selecting short positions the fund seeks to identify securities with low earnings quality or aggressive accounting which may be intended on the part of company management to mask operational deterioration and bolster the reported earnings per share over a short time period in addition the portfolio manager seeks to identify earnings driven events that may act as a catalyst to the price decline of a security such as downwards earnings revisions or reduced forward guidance” presently the fund has a heavy cash component and its top “short equity” positions are in the following names  ddr  cbl  mdso  ayi and  data note that ddr has really tumbled lately trading at a new week low today as are cbl and ayi hdge is the largest “nonindex” equity etf classified in the “inverse equity” space behind such funds like “bear” etfs from proshares that are meant largely for aggressive trading andor hedging because the funds are designed to deliver the daily inverse return of a benchmark index ie sh proshares short sp  expense ratio   billion in aum rwm proshares short russell  expense ratio   million in aum psq proshares short qqq expense ratio   million in aum and dog proshares

pm nyseypro sweta killa advisorshares the marylandbased etf issuer leading the active etfs space continues its expansion of innovative products in accordance with the small investment firms the issuer has rolled out advisorshares yieldpro etf providing investors a new play in the high yield space with enhanced protection from volatility its latest foray into the space comes from the elements financial group which is acting as the portfolio manager for ypro the latest addition raises the existing active etfs lineup to  ypro in focus the new etf is a fund of funds that looks to offer investors current income and capital appreciation by investing in both long and short positions across a variety of fixed income etfs or other income producing etfs in the portfolio construction of ypro the manager will pursue attractive yield and handle volatility through a quantitative approach to risk budgeting which also includes the use of options to hedge residual equity and interest rate risk when needed due to this unique selection of bond etfs the fund seeks to provide diversification benefits across multiple fixed income segments currently this strategy produces a welldiversified fund of funds that has long positions in over two dozen etfs top three holdings at the time of writing include powershares preferred portfolio pgx peritus high yield etf hyld – etf report and vanguard intermediateterm corporate bond etf vcit with   and  share respectively read hyld the best choice among high yield bond etfs investors should note that the fund has a somewhathigh expense ratio when compared to index funds as the net expense comes in at  how does this fit in a portfolio the new product appears an interesting choice for investors seeking yield maximization in the current low interest environment while targeting a lower level of risk this is because ypro’s unique combination of risk budgeting and hedging provides less volatility high flexibility and low correlations to the equity market with modest tapering underway a cushion against rising rates has become necessary with the launch of ypro investors could smartly manage interest rate risk given the fund’s innovative approach and riskadjusted returns with competitive yields competition though this new actively managed etf of etfs does not have any direct competitor due to its unique long and short strategy it might still face tough competition from several products available in the high yield space the most popular is ishares iboxx  high yield corporate bond etf hyg that has accumulated nearly  billion and charges  bps in fees a year from investors the fund has average maturity and effective duration of  years and  years respectively another product is spdr barclays capital high yield bond etf jnk which has  million in aum and  in expense ratio the etf targets intermediate end of the yield curve with average maturity of  years and modified average duration of  years apart from these first trust high yield longshort etf hyls could pose a strong obstacle to the new entrant this fund seeks to provide a high level of income while reducing the interest rate risk to some extent see all high yield etfs here hyls intends to maintain both long and short positions – long positions in highyield debt securities including us and nonus corporate debt obligations bank loans and convertible bonds and short positions in high yield us treasuries and corporate bonds the fund charges  in annual fees bottom line the new etf from advisorshares could see big inflows if it can manage to generate stronger yields than the other choices though the cost of the product is bit expensive it is probably far less than the ‘traditional’ hedge funds however active management and need to understand the fund’s insight might restrict volume levels at the initial stage suggesting wide bid ask spreads this article is brought to you courtesy of eric dutram   read next no related posts recommended for you get free

be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase deleted

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
