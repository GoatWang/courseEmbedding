dream bathroom makeover in  days plus exclusive video training its free as seen on by jeff patterson in cleaning ceramic tile how on earth do you clean ceramic tile and grout…and what products work best this was a question i was pondering while taking a shower the other day primarily because the grout on our shower’s ceramic floor wasn’t looking so good i try to keep our shower clean but with two adults and two kids it’s pretty darn hard to maintain mr clean’s level of tidiness hey the guy has no hair and that helps a lot with keeping showers looking immaculate we have small  inch by  inch square tiles on our shower floor sound familiar and my primary goal was to determine the best way to clean them i also wanted to see if the same solution used to clean the ceramic tile could clean the grout here’s what i used oxiclean versatile stain remover  eco orange citrus cleaner  chlorox  i’ve read so many articles on the awesomeness of oxiclean oxygenated bleach and wanted to see for myself how it would work on ceramic tile  grout my wife bought eco orange citrus cleaner from a salesperson in our neighborhood because it’s supposedly nontoxic and kid friendly we’ve used it for general cleaning and it seemed like a good thought to try it on the shower too and as a last resort i tried chlorox bleach it’s not my preference due to the noxious fumes and likelihood you’ll ruin your clothes using it admittedly i hit a road block the first few times i used oxiclean i’ll share my experience because it sheds light on the amount of oxiclean i found to have the most power at the very least you’ll want to scroll through the pictures since i was growing my cheesy moustache to raise money for prostate cancer awareness let’s get started 🙂 how much oxiclean powder should be used to clean ceramic tile  grout this is a great question because everyone’s ceramic tile  grout has a different level of dirtiness let’s first discuss how the makers of oxiclean recommend using it for hard surfaces like tile  grout     the directions on the oxiclean container say to fill the oxiclean scoop to line  and add it to  gallon of water it’s also suggested that a more concentrated solutionpaste may be required for surfaces like grout and i’m certainly going to discuss this point they then recommend applying the oxiclean  water solution to tile with a sponge or brush or by pouring it directly on top of the surface and the final step is to let the oxiclean stand on the tile  grout for  minutes and to not let it dry out okay that’s what you’ll read on the oxiclean box i performed  different tests on my ceramic tile to see what concentration of oxiclean would work best my hope was that i’d only have to do one experiment and poof i’d be be a cleaning genius but no such luck the first test i did used  cup of oxiclean added to  gallon of hot water i let the solution stand on the tile  grout for  minutes and scrubbed for about  minutes this produced somewhat cleaner grout but the tile didn’t look any better the second test used  cup of oxiclean added to  gallon of hot water again i let the solution stand on the tile  grout for  minutes and scoured for  minutes the results were a mixed bag the grout was clean in some areas and dirty in others as was the tile the third test involved  cups of oxiclean added to  gallon of hot water this time i let the solution stand for  minutes and scrubbed for  minutes at the beginning and end as a result the tile  grout looked much better the tile in particular sparkled and some of the grime i couldn’t get off with the scrub brush in tests  and  was completely gone     my conclusion is that  cups of oxiclean mixed with one gallon of hot water will defintely clean ceramic tile i barely had to use the nylon scrub brush to get the tiles looking brand new this concentration will also eliminate mild grout stains and dirt but there were still sections of discolored grout maybe my grout was too far gone to be cleaned by oxiclean but that doesn’t mean i gave up   why should you use oxygenated bleach to clean ceramic tile i try to stay as healthy as possible and one sure way to get sick is to expose yourself to harsh chemicals plus my kids use the same bathroom and shower as us so the last thing i want to do is use chlorine bleach or some other product that could harm their lungs  skin oxygenated bleach contains sodium percarbonate when oxygenated bleach is dissolved in water a chemical reaction occurs that releases hydrogen peroxide and sodium carbonate this reaction is nontoxic and environmentally friendly plus oxygenated bleach doesn’t contain chlorine so you don’t have to worry about it discoloring carpets or clothing while cleaning tile  grout important never mix vinegar with hydrogen peroxide as this reaction forms peracetic acid which can melt lead bullets i mention this because many people might try vinegar to clean tile then use oxiclean bad idea altogether can eco orange or chlorox clean shower tile  grout at this point in my experiment the shower tile was immaculate the grout was driving me nuts even though each successive oxiclean treatment improved the grout’s look there were still discolored grout lines on some portions of the shower floor enter eco orange citrus cleaner this stuff is expensive at  per gallon like i said in the introduction we’ve used it to clean different areas of our home like sinks bathtubs floors etc it’s marketed as being safe and nontoxic which is important to us because we have  young daughters it works really well as a general cleaner as it should for that price holy mother of mercy i used  part eco orange to  parts water in this case  cups of eco orange to  cups of warm water once mixed thoroughly i poured it onto the shower tile  grout and scrubbed the grout for  minutes with a nylon brush then i rinsed the shower floor with clean water unfortunately the grout was still discolored if i had to just tidy up the shower floor i’d most certainly use eco orange because it would do a good job eliminating superficial dirt but grout renewer it is not     moving on to chlorox bleach i really dislike using chlorox bleach but wanted to see if it could make a dent in my grout after putting on rubber gloves a respirator and eye protection i mixed  cup of chlorox with  cups of water     this is super concentrated but that’s the point i didn’t want to perform multiple experiments with bleach i scrubbed the tile grout for  minutes and let the chlorox stand on the tile surface for another  then i rinsed with clean water after saying a little prayer to the grout gods just kidding but if they existed you know i would kneel in reverence and waiting  minutes i checked on the grout sorry folks chlorox just didn’t help in this case     so what shall i do the shower tile is looking fantastic but the grout is still discolored in some areas     i started home repair tutor to share my wins and losses to help others this is a tie 🙂 my hope was that one of these three products could have cleaned both the tile and grout in our shower i’m confident that oxiclean can clean anyone’s ceramic tiles and while it didn’t fully live up to my grout cleansing expectations i think you should try it since it helped brighten up about  of our grout lines it’s relatively affordable at  and worth a shot since it’s nontoxic i may try a few other products in order to get my tile grout looking better   what’s next hope you liked these tips let me know what you think down in the comments finally if you’re doing a bathroom remodel you might like our free ‘guide to

i think is called grout renew or grout refresh it’s available at home depot lowes etc i’ve seen rave reviews on various blogs it comes in different colors which makes me wonder if it’s a cleaner or more like a paint or resurfacer it sounds like it’s worth a shot though reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm thanks jessica for the tip i saw this product in the store i wanted to see if i could clean the grout first but it could be an option down the road isn’t grout the most difficult area to keep clean i swear it turns gray the instant you look at it 🙁 reply susan denise drake says july   at  pm hi jeff re tile and grout cleaning first if you redo a bath choose a color of grout thats already darker not whitehalf of your problem solved second…hate to say it but full strength bleach has been successful for me on white grout most importantly to get the best result one has to be part chemist if the stains are body dirt and soap scum…ie alkyline try vinegar if they are rust stains the worst in my experience oxy or bleach may work is the water hard or soft all these aspects need to be considered to get the best result ask you friendly  yr old who also happens to be a bath designer ☺ reply janieb says july   at  pm i do not know about grout renew but after going through all the machinations you have discussed with various cleaners i did indeed paint my grout that works for a while how does reglazing work on the stains it sounds like that might be helpful jane reply lindsey says february   at  pm i have used the mapei grout renew it’s amazing it seems as it would take less time to do it vs the various cleaning methods you’ve tried the beauty i’ve used in my kitchen laundry and powder room so far everything beads off it i spilled tomato sauce on it a full year after i applied it and nothing it like it has a wax coating with just makes cleaning so much easier on a general basis i found this article because we just had a brand new mast shower installed with small hex tiles and i really didn’t wanna spend the time to go over it in the same color with the renew because it is hard work but it looks like it’ll be more than worth it in the long run reply jeff patterson says february   at  am thanks lindsey for mentioning mapei’s grout renew i’ll have to check that out and do a tutorial reply sheilag  plum doodles says november   at  pm well jeff you could always do what i did in our guest bath paint the walls soon after putting down new floor tile make sure you dump the can of paint when you move the ladder because you forgot to remove the aforementioned can of paint before moving the said ladder… 😛 reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm oh my gosh that sounds painful we’ve all done stuff like that and it almost happens in slow motion i’m guessing you had quite the cleanup on your hands even with a drop cloth i once spilled paint all over myself when painting a ceiling not fun 🙁 but these make for great stories reply sheilag  plum doodles says november   at  pm um yeah about the drop cloth…  reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm you cracked me up with your response thanks sheila for your great sense of humor at least we can laugh about our prior mishaps with paint 🙂 reply andrew bigler says december   at  am sheilag i firmly believe in using drop clothes or plastic sheeting while painting my floor is a fantastic example of failing to use said tools reply jeff patterson says december   at  am dito andrew getting paint on carpet is no fun tanya says november   at  am i have used comet and the ajax brand of the same thing to clean grout in a kitchen and it worked wonders i made a thin paste and applied it scrubbed it then let it sit for ish minutes then scrubbed again and rinsed it away reply jeff patterson says november   at  am that’s another ingenious tip tanya i’ll give that a shot i love using comet in our kitchen sink to clean and disinfect thank you so much for providing the specific directions and letting me know how long to let the paste sit on the grout 🙂 reply email protected nikiforoff designs says november   at  pm i too use comet for grout discoloration however remember that it too as well as ajax both have chlorine in them…so do be careful with fumes and sometimes when i’m lazy i just spray liquid bleach right on the grout i put the exhaust fan on and work in short spurts…as long as i can hold my breath between spray times… the truth of the matter is once the grout is really badly discolored you’ll probably not find anything in the home cleaner line that will get it perfectly cleaned 🙁 so the trick is clean wellclean often…yes it’s tough when the family uses the shower a lot there are other specific grout cleaners out there as others have mentioned i’ve never used them but would love to know how they work if they’re reasonably priced etc because our home now has a grouted shower…before it was an allinone shower stall that was much easier to clean reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm thanks connie for the ajax tip grout is so tough to maintain and i’ve given thought to using epoxy formulas but they are tricky to apply i spoke with the technical support line today at custom building products they make polyblend grout and recommended sulfamic acid to clean grout so this might be my last resort before regrouting the shower floor i think it would be interesting to remove the grout and try an epoxy formula reply jessica says april   at  am hi i my name is jessica i wanted to comment on the grout … i have subway tiles in the bathroom i use a brillo pad to remove the grout it came off right away reply just me says july   at  pm the army uses cometajax to clean its floors walls latrines etc i’ve scrubbed stripped the wax off countless vinyl tile floors with a buffer water and comet with a gang of other unlucky soldiers on a sunday night it works reply theresa james says november   at  pm for literally years i have tried every product and home recipe that i have found to try and keep my husband’s shower clean so far i have found nothing that cleaned to my satisfaction recently i found a home recipe on a web site so as usual i mixed it up and tried it to my utter disbelief after the cleaning it was as if i was looking at a new shower mix this up and give it a try heat  cup of white vinegar in the microwave for  seconds pour the vinegar into a spray bottle add one cup of blue dawn dishwashing liquid i don’t know why it must be blue however that was stressed shake to mix spray the area to be cleaned tile glass fixtures with this mixture it will spray on like a gel let it sit for  hours after the  hours scrub all surfaces scrub if you want – i only needed to rub  rinse and stand back and see the sparkle this mixture does smell really bad but the smell dissipates fairly quickly hope it does as good for you as it has done for me reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm theresa this is super interesting i will definitely try it do you recommend any special type of spray bottle the heating of the vinegar seems to be the key action this is right up my alley very chemistry oriented brings back memories of organic chemistry class and beakers exploding haha i’ll let you know how it works reply theresa james says november   at  am jeff i just used a regular  quart spray bottle with a trigger spray i got some at lowe’s i believe reply jeff patterson says november   at  am thank you so much theresa i’ll be visiting lowes today to pickup some supplies 🙂 reply theresa james says november   at  am great jeff please let me know what you think dana says january   at  pm i have seen this recipe and actually a modified version that i tried just yesterday for calcified and hard water stains around the kitchen and bath faucets as well as tub and tile fill  a spray bottle with vinegar warm or not although i believe warm would be better add  cup of lemon juice bottled juice is acceptable add your favorite dish soap i used dawn “original” i only wish i’d taken before and after pics of my kitchen and bath hardware to show you the difference but you can try it for yourself really outstanding i did not however try this on my grout issues yet i have the same one as you jeff i cleaned my guest bath and shower with it yesterday which was very clean anyway so short of mentioning the tile  hardware having a sparkling finish i can’t say much about the grout if reapplication is needed for anyone after letting that solution sit for  minutes or more i’d be surprised recently i tried “soft scrub total all purpose with bleach” in my master shower which is the one with the grout issues the application is similar to the above vinegar solution in that its foamy and stays where applied i got some decent results but certainly not perfection or renewal a while back i’d tried tilex root and that absolutely restored the grout better but its just seriously awful my handyman directed me to a grout pen and that will absolutely cover and seal your grout if applied correctly making it look pretty new again i can’t tell you how fun it was to use that on my ″ octagonal tiles 😛 thank you for your great blog reply jeff patterson says january   at  am thanks dana for the great recipe i agree with you on tilexit works by the bleachy smell is so overpowering that i don’t use it primarily because my wife’s asthma will be triggered i’ve thought about the grout pen and called the company that makes it they only recommend using it on grout that won’t be exposed to water thus my only choice at this point is to probably regrout the shower floor but that should be a good post in the future 🙂 reply dana says january   at  pm just updating and commenting about teresa’s post and her recipe requiring the blue dawn dishwashing liquid i got funky and decided to try the green apple scented dawn because it is antibacterial although vinegar is antibacterial i thought i’d try the added antibacterial soap i will say i did not find quite the same results although fine results with a delightful apple smell much more appealing than the blue dawn recipe thanks again for the awesome blog kudos on a job well done reply jeff patterson says january   at  am cool idea dana thanks for sharing i wonder if you could make it a half and half recipe half green apple and half blue dawn it’s cool when we all try these different things makes me think of high school chemistry and fortunately there’s no chance of soap or vinegar exploding merrell says august   at  pm antibacterial soaps are oh so bad for the environment they are killing the fish so please  you don’t need them at all and while i am here please don’t flush any old medicines down the toilet or sink as they are also so very harmful  i believe the ‘magic erasers’ have formaldehyde in them or so i was told by a scientist friend i am looking for non harmful ways to clean and love this site thanks jeff will try the dawn and vinegar solution jeff patterson says october   at  pm i second your plea for not flushing medicines down the toilet or drain merrell the pharmacy will take old medicines at no cost i did this with some left over meds we had 😀 r says october   at  pm my husband went ballistic when i told him i sprayed vinegar on the tile and the grout then proceeded to lecture me that vinegar is acid and will eat through the grout he’s angry that i have “ruined” the grout even though i haven’t as far as i can tell and he keeps reading articles from the internet that vinegar will burn through the grout can anyone who has used the vinegar and blue dawn method confirm or deny the information about the grout and vinegar has anyone wrecked their grout reply laurie fox says july   at  pm won’t the vinegar boil if it’s for  seconds i too have tried multiple ways of trying to clean my kitchen floor grout very light beige almost white and my shower tile floor grout also very light beige for the kitchen i have used a paste made of baking soda and white vinegar leave it on for at least  min if very dirty then use a scrub brush i used a toothbrush to scrub you might have to use a little more vinegar worked pretty well but since i did not seal the floor afterwards  months later it was dirty again tried it in my shower but it didn’t work i think it is too far gone reply matt michel says july   at  pm the most important thing to do after your hard work of scrubbing is to seal the floor otherwise you did all that hard work for nothing  you can buy any grout sealer at home depot or similar for twenty dollars then buy the grout sealer roll on brush for five dollars then follow directions on a bottle very simple that or pay a company like mine to do it for fifty dollars the sealer will protect stains for around three years then simply redo the sealer most of the deep grout stains you won’t be able to remove its soaked all the way through you can stain grout lines or replace the grout lines but cleaning it will only get you so far i have twenty years experience in this work i’m happy to answer any questions the grout email protected my name is matt reply jeff patterson says july   at  am thanks matt for your comment grout is such a tough thing for homeowners like us really appreciate your candid feedback 🙂 reply luva lynne atitlan says september   at  pm thanks so much all of you for your comments and suggestions i now have several ideas for how to clean my very dirty bathtub tiles and grout thanks jeff for hosting this very useful forum it’s exactly what i was looking for jeff patterson says september   at  pm you’re super welcome luva when i read comments like your’s it makes me want to make a ton of videos so i’ll keep doing just that susan says july   at  pm hi theresa the blue dawn is a grease cutter most of the time mildew grows under soap scum soap scum is grease has to be removed first then mold and mildew can be removed easily with hydrogen peroxide i have been a house cleaner since  i perfer bleach it works the best reply theresa james says august   at  pm before i found this ‘recipe’ i had tried everything including retail miracle cleaners bleach peroxide just everything that i read or saw that was supposed to help this problem no good results with any i tried the dawnvinegar solution as i usually would in my search for something that would do the job for once something worked i have used it ever since with great results reply jeff patterson says august   at  pm hi theresa so glad to hear you had a success i know that feeling when you’re at your wits end and need a solution badly cool beans 🙂 jeff reply sue schultz says november   at  pm question about the dawn and vinegar i tried this a long time ago when it first was listed on social media and not on grout but do you reheat the mixture when you want to use it again obviously when you make a spray bottle full or even half you’re going to have alot left appreciate your repsonse reply beverly says november   at  pm i tried the vinegar and blue dawn formula i did not like it first it was incredibly viscous and very difficult to spray second i broke two sprayers in the process third and most important the results were nothing to write home about love this forum reply amy says february   at  am hi susan  part question how do you remove the soap scum first and then how do you recommend cleaning the mildew with hydrogen peroxide reply joan collier says october   at  pm going to make this mixture and hopefully have found a solution to ugly dirty grout tried many products and gets a little here and there but overall still ugly worst places i have been painting lasts a little while then comes off estimate for steam cleaning was  don’t want to pay that much don’t know how much would cost to have regrouted reply jeff patterson says october   at  pm hi joan  is a lot of loot you might be able to regrout for that price depending on the area and certainly could regrout it yourself for much much less how big is your surface area if it’s a powder room you could get it done in a weekend for sure i’d volunteer but my wife has be doing other stuff for the next several monthslol jeff reply theresa james says october   at  pm i sure hope it works for you i use it on a regular basis and what it might not get all of one tme it usually does the next i am going to regrout and seal my shower floor as soon as cooler weather makes me stay inside instead of working in my yard reply jeff patterson says october   at  pm theresa let me know how the regrouting goes but until then enjoy the weather 😉 jeff reply anni says october   at  pm thought i’d try the blue dawn and vinegar and when i went to mix the soution realized i’d forgotton dawn but i did have cascade complete liquid dishwasher soap with dawn in it so i mixed one cup of that with one cup of warm vinegar this destroyed my spray bottle and i had to apply with a rag but in a matter of minutes the tiles were clean and the grout looked better than it had in years the lowest tiles in the shower still have some residue on them so i will reapply with the straight blue dawn gotta say tho that the cascade really is a powerful cleaner for gloss finish ceramic tiles thank you sooo much for your suggestions this is a great blog…i am going to get grout sealer next reply jeff patterson says october   at  pm hey anni that’s crazy stuff can’t believe your spray bottle was destroyed powerful stuff to say the least let me know how the rest of the cleaning goes but it sounds like you’re pretty happy jeff reply tammy says december   at  am cascade has bleach in it you dont mix bleach and vinegar its a deadly mix it will kill youit makes chlorine gaspleased be careful mixing stuff together reply jeff patterson says december   at  pm thanks for your concern tammy the cascade in our case was encrusted on the dishwasher and no chemical reaction occurred but you’re correct being careful with chemicals is the prudent decision elizabeth says may   at  pm ammonia and bleach create chlorine gas always best to be cautious when mixing cleaners though theeresa james says october   at  am isn’t it great when you finally hit on that “right” thing that makes your efforts worth while glad it’s working for you reply anni says october   at  pm hello all…yup it really was awesome to see the grime disappear so fast with that dishwasher soap and vinegar haven’t yet done the second treatment thought i’d compare the dawn and vinegar with the cascade and vinegar both on this surround and on the shower walls downstairs which are…well let’s just not put words to it anyhow here’s how my bottle was destroyed apparently there’s something in the cascade that reacted like baking soda with the vinegar rather explosive the liquid began coming out the spray nozzle and when i released the sprayer to stop that there was no problem however the spray trigger failed after that to work so i applied by hand thanks for all the comments about grout i’m going to seal after i clean the final time i love tile too but…in areas that offer oils and grease of any kind maybe not the best choice i just put cork floors in for my yoga studio and reiki treatment room and love them the salesperson said he’d sold cork to several people for their kitchens easy peasy to clean with the bona system i’ll keep you posted on that… thanks everyone this is now my go to site for all things “how the heck do you do that” anni reply jeff patterson says october   at  pm awesome anni thanks for your kind words i love reading everyone’s tips and hope that we all learn from each other keep us posted on the cork floors i’ve never installed them but would like to some day 🙂 jeff dea says may   at  pm doesn’t liquid dishwasher soap have bleach in it that should not be mixed with vinegar reply jeff patterson says may   at  pm it depends on the brand and type of soap you’d have to check but yes don’t mix chemicals is always a good rule to follow reply marion freyburger says september   at  am i just found this site and i love it i have a shower with tile and glass and it gets dirty all the time i tried the vinegar and blue dawn and it worked fantistic i will be sending this site and link to everyone i know it was so simple heat the vinegar add the dawn spray you may want to use a mask it does smell pretty bad wait  hours and for the most part we just use a magic eraser sponge after it dried you can see where you missed as it dried a white so we just went back over the area all i can say is thank you reply jeff patterson says september   at  pm that’s awesome marion thanks so much for confirming this is a great option i love hearing these success stories reply katrina says october   at  pm ok i just mixed it  sprayed it all over the shower now i’ll watch some tv for  hours then go rinse it  see how it works i did make the decision when we built our house to use a grayish color grout so the grout looks ok but does that mean its really ok but the tile already looks dingy reply jeff patterson says october   at  pm keep me posted katrina one other solution i’ve recently discovered is oxiclean max force but test it on your grout in a small area to see if it reacts okay i let the max force sit on the grout for  minutes then scrub it reply lauren says december   at  am thank you theresa james thank you jeff patterson i just tried that vinegarblue dawn solution it’s only been an hour  i’m impatient but i did a spot check and i can’t believe the difference i was just cleaning my tile today with tilex and the grout was so dingy looking i came across your website and decided to give this a shot i wish i could upload a photo for everyone to see all i can say is it works reply kati says november   at  am does it matter what kind of vinegar you use reply karen says april   at  pm question living in a very arid environment colorado things dry out very quickly did your solution dry out as you left it on  hours if not would two hour applications work do you think reply cate says april   at  pm i tried the vinegar plus dawn and didn’t like it it left soap scum visible on the glass and shower fixtures nickel there is probably soap scum on the tile too i just can’t see it reply david killeen says march   at  pm theresa james i am way late to the party your original post is from  but i recently bought a house and inherited a good bit of stained bathroom tile grout so i did an internet search and found this helpful blog and your intriguing reply i tried a couple harsh chemicals with little success i will admit that i was skeptical but i decided to give your recipe a try figuring it would put me out a whopping  either way and i was amazed by the results i followed your directions exactly and the grout is whiter and brighter than i could have ever expected truly i was floored thank you reply apd says november   at  pm i decided to give this a try on our tile shower we used a grout sealer when it was new and over the years the sealer started to yellow the tiles and grout this cleaning solution worked like a charm no more yellow the shower looks new again thank you for sharing this worked amazing reply angela says january   at  am i used this solution on my very neglected but daily used bathtub area and it did a great job some mold still remained but it took off  of it now that the major cleaning is done i plan on cleaning area on a regular basis thx reply mic says november   at  pm two suggestions – mr clean magic eraser bathroom style or kboom i have used both to clean my white bathroom tile  grout reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm i love using magic erasers although i’ve learned my lesson and now wear gloves when i use them i’m sure whatever chemical is in them isn’t great for skin since mine always peals after making contact that said the erasers live up to their name and are really awesome at eliminating fingerprints on doors now i’m sounding like some csi person but in reality i just have kids lol reply rich says august   at  pm jeff hard to believe but there are no chemicals in magic erasers it’s a cleaning stick made of melamine foam no kidding so no gloves needed httpenwikipediaorgwikimelaminefoam reply jeff patterson says august   at  pm hey rich thanks for clearing up this cloudy issue i love using magic erasers for tons of stuff they really come in handy when you’ve got kids jeff reply cheryl spencer says december   at  am i think the reason that the packages warn about no skin contact is because the pads can be quite abrasive i have learned the hard way to only use them on matte surfaces or areas where light reflectionsglare won’t draw attention to the scrub marks that they leave on shinyglossy surfaces reply jeff patterson says december   at  pm i think you’re right cheryl they have a mild abrasiveness to them emma briggs says november   at  pm i also appreciate that the cleaning products you use do not smell bad reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm i hear you emma the stinky smell of some cleaners is just downright bad it’s unfortunate that certain natural cleaners don’t work and we have to stick with caustic ones reply reema says november   at  am natural cleaners work great for upkeep it’s when upkeep isn’t done regularly that you have problems with needing to really deep clean and get out stains i know i’m guilty of getting behind on chores but staying on top of things is really the key to dealing with these problems 🙂 i use vinegar to clean and i usually use orange peel to help boost the vinegar power i fill a pickle jar with juicy orange peel and pour vinegar over the peel i let sit for a week or so and then refill my spray bottles with the home made orange cleaner smells better than just regular vinegar and cleans better too when i first moved into my house though the tile was gross i used clorox toilet bowl cleaner the gel stuff in the bottle with the crooked neck to whiten the grout it works wonders though you must wear thick rubber gloves and safety glasses to scrub it open the windows and let the bathroom air out after a cleaning and be sure to rinse really well i learned about toilet bowl cleaner when i worked at a family owned shop in highschool we had to do a big cleaning day and they used it to clean everything in the bathrooms caustic but effective reply jeff patterson says november   at  am thanks reema for the great vinegar and orange peel recipe you’re totally right about vinegar smelling a lot better with orange peel i love this creative idea and this is exactly why the comment sections of websites are soooooo important i’ll give the toilet bowl cleaner a try today while i’m doing some pluming work around the house if this doesn’t work i doubt anything else will do the trick haha it would be fantastic if such caustic products weren’t necessary and your comment on upkeep cuts straight to how we can avoid this issue problem upkeep upkeep upkeepso easy to say yet so hard to do reply martha says november   at  am i don’t have a tile bath anymore yay but when i did i always used the toiled bowl cleaner and brush on the tile never had a grout problem i liked the little hole so you could squirt it out and it would run down the grout line and even going crosswise wasn’t bad because it is thick i also discovered a product that helps to keep the bath clean longer “clean shower” you clean your bath good then spray that on all the surfaces daily after bathing spray again really aided in “big cleaning day” because the surfaces were never as dirty i use it still on my smooth surface bath and it seems to prevent build up i used to love to clean i’m  now and that is not my top priority 🙂 reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm thanks martha for the cleaning product tip it sounds like your bathrooms are spic and span clean 🙂 the main idea thread from everyone seams to be daily maintenance cleaning is the biggest and best thing we can all do my mom is  and i think she’d like to be done with cleaning too but now she’s onto changing diapers for my sister who just had a baby girl 🙂 so it might be awhile before her retirement from cleaning reply sue says november   at  pm i recently read that zep is supposed to be really good so add it to your list reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm you got it sue i tried a few other products this weekend the first was tilex and it didn’t help that doesn’t mean it won’t benefit someone else though but i’ll keep trudging forward to see if there’s a better solution 🙂 reply joe says november   at  am i second the zep formula…i think it’s called grout cleaner i used that in a badly dirtied bathroom tile floor with great results…followed up with a sealer reply pam says november   at  pm a year ago i tried cleaning something in my sink with the toilet bowl cleaner mentioned above my chrome sink drain will never be the same looks awful that stuff really is caustic – be careful reply jeff patterson says november   at  am sorry to hear the toilet bowl cleaner ruined your sink pam can you remember what brand it was so that anyone seeing this post won’t have the same bad experience it might be safe to say that we should avoid using such a product anywhere there is metal reply pam says november   at  am it’s called the works it’s pretty potent but still doesn’t get rid of the water line mineral deposit in the toilet i’m on a well do you know any good cleaners for that reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm well pam i would have thought the works or clr could remove these rings but apparently this isn’t the case unfortunately i don’t have any other suggestions i wish i could be more helpful reply tanya says november   at  pm pam the “toilet bowl cleaner” from dollar general dollar general brand works wonders on toilet bowl water rings i squirt it in there making sure to cover all of it then wait about  minutes…voila clean i live in an apartment and had that glorious ring in both toilets since we moved in almost a year ago…one day i saw that stuff and decided to try it and it worked perfectly kate says march   at  pm there is a toilet bowl stone like a pumice stone that you use on dry heels that you can get at walmart that i have used with success to remove hard water lines in a toilet bowl reply jeff patterson says march   at  am thanks kate for the tip i’ve never used one before but it sounds like you’ve had some success with it i really appreciate your suggestion because several people have asked for a product like this 🙂 alissa says august   at  pm kaboom toilet gel worked wonders on the mineral deposit lines goes in purple then turns green when you’re ready to wipe 🙂 reply jeff patterson says august   at  am hey alissa thanks for the kaboom tip i like the fact that it turns colors to indicate the wiping action way cool jeff donnainohio says december   at  am i’m on a well and have a lime buildup ring in the toilet too and have found a simple way to get rid of it even if it’s really bad flush the toilet and as the water level is at its lowest and starting to refill pour in a quart of vinegar and make sure the toilet fills to just above the ring let it sit a couple of hours then use a regular toilet scrubber to work it off this is very easy when you do it every couple of weeks when we were out of town three months and guests did not do the full clean it was harder in that case when we got home i did the vinegar soak and the ring came off but there was a coating down at the bottom of the throat of the bowl that i had to use a hard plastic spatula to kind of chip off though the vinegar softened it apparently the ring is related to bacteria though if i drop one of those bleach cakes into the tank after thoroughly flushing all vinegar out of the bowl i don’t see a ring at all until the bleach cake is nearly gone so now that i think of it maybe if i just poured a cup of vinegar into the bowl more often even if i didn’t scrub it would stay ringfree without a bleach cake reply cheryl says october   at  pm to clean the lines in a toilet i’ve used a grey pumice stone wear gloves since your hands are in the toilet it gently scrubbed off the ring that a lot of toilets get after many years of use it’s important that the pumice stone is grey because red stones will scratch the toilet i used it with comet and was amazed at how the toilets looked like new again reply mellisa arteaga says november   at  am i found the best toilet cleaner and it is lysol toilet bowl cleaner with lime and rust remover it is a black bottle reply julie says september   at  pm try using something called a pumie scouring stick these are pumice will not scratch your toilet if it is porcelain and in just a few minutes your toilet will be like new – and no chemicals involved you can buy these at hardware stores and they are also sold on amazon they have a host of other uses as well you will be happy reply linda says november   at  pm only thing i have learned was that oxyclean works wonders on a fiberglass shower floor i wet the floor sprinkle powder oxiclean and go away half a day no scrubbing and it is nice and white reply jeff patterson says november   at  am that’s awesome linda i really appreciate your story because we have a few rental homes with fiberglass shower floors and i’m sure they will need cleaned thoroughly i think oxiclean can certainly help with stains that haven’t gone for years and years it seams like a great day to day cleaner that can help keep surfaces looking fantastic this is all important stuff since the holidays are approaching 🙂 reply lynne says november   at  pm after getting your tile clean mix tsp tea tree oil to  c water in a spray bottle spray all around after showering…it really helps saw this on pinterest reply jeff patterson says november   at  am this is another super tip lynne do you recommend any brand of tea tree oil i only have experience with shampoo that has tea tree in it lol this solution would also make the shower smell terrific and it’s natural thanks for great suggestion reply email protected nikiforoff designs says november   at  pm i found something similar to this idea quite by accident i had splashed some hair conditioner on the shower door later to find the water didn’t leave spots where the conditioner was so after i cleaned the shower door i rubbed conditioner all over the doori just used my hand actually it left a sort of ‘oily film’ on the door and the water didn’t bead up on it it acted like a sort of ‘sheet’ so the water ran off more easily and yes we have quite hard water this was a glass shower door but i’m suspecting it would work as easily on a fiberglass door 🙂 so in case you’re wondering what kind of hair conditioner it was the semipermanent hair color i use comes with a tube of conditioner i have a ton of those around so i used that just be careful not to get too much of the conditioner on the floor…it may cause slipperiness wipe the floor well if this does happen reply sarah says november   at  pm walmart carries tea tree oil it’s inexpensive and has a dropper applicator which is great tea tree is also a natural lice repellent it’s great to add to your shampoo for your scalp’s benefit and peace of mind reply beth says november   at  pm the only thing i have found that works on my shower grout is x i am sure it is not environmentally friendly based on the fumes i wear a mask and gloves when using it but it works reply jeff patterson says november   at  am good to hear about another product beth can you get x at the grocery store or is it a special order product i apologize for not being up to date on my cleaners 😉 there are so many different options for cleaning grout i’m thinking i should put together another post just to list them all reply judi says november   at  am i moved into an apartment where the shower tile outgrunged the average turkish prison after scrubbing well with ajax powder and rinsing several times–and sobbing salty tears–i sprayed all surfaces with tilex mold and mildew spray and went outside for about an hour tada i simply had to rinse and the yuck was gone now i use the stuff regularly to clean toilets sinks etc but it is wise to have good ventilation it’s worth trying good luck reply jeff patterson says november   at  am the first part of your comment cracked me up judi hilarious thanks for the tilex tip i tried it over the weekend and unfortunately is didn’t work but i totally believe in tilex as an upkeep product meaning it will help prevent the type of situation i’m in now if i’d been using it routinely our grout would look out of this world where the heck was this grungy apartment that was worse than a turkish prison i had to ask reply susan says november   at  am i use “bar keeper’s friend” cleanser and polish for grout maintenance i found out about it when i bought new pots and pans and it was recommended for proper cleaning of the stainless had never used it before and now i wonder how i ever cleaned without it i’ve tried it on all surfaces with wonderful results even on rust my kitchen grout was really dingy looking in the traffic path so down on my knees i went with the bf and a magic eraser a few swipes and the grout looked like new i believe it has a mild acid in it which is the miracle worker so wear gloves though i have used it most times bare handed it’s my go to choice for all dirty jobs it restores most household items to a “like new” appearance reply susan says november   at  am oh and by the way it’s really cheap under  a can reply jeff patterson says november   at  am you and the other commenters have convinced me to give both bar keeper’s friend and magic erasers a shot i’ve never heard of using the two of them together but this is an interesting idea did you have any bad chemical reaction that created a bad vapor i just wanted to check before moving forward i’d also encourage others to wear gloves when using magic erasers i’ve had my skin peel around my fingernails after using them reply susan says november   at  am there is no outgassing or reaction at all but the bkf is very powdery like talc so i would be careful when sprinkling to not be vigorous about it so as not to inhale any resulting “poof” of the product i have transfered the bkf to a glass restaurant style cheese shaker you know the one that resides in every pizza place so that i can keep it handy on the sink and the smaller size of the bottle keeps the powder more targeted reply jeff patterson says november   at  am that’s a wonderful idea susanusing the cheese shaker for the bar keeper’s friend i really appreciate all your suggestions and tips reply susan says november   at  am you know i was looking at your pix once again and i noticed in the  picture with your finger pointing that the darker color may not be discolored grout have you considered that the mortar mastic that adhered the tiles might be showing trough the grayishputty color looks about right before the areas that you cleaned were clean was it all the same color or was it still spotty looking it’s entirely possible that the installer was a bit heavy handed with the adhesive and it squished through the tile spaces thereby not leaving enough depth for sufficient grout in spots perhaps all of your attempts at cleaning have removed the thin layer of grout over the mastic just a random thought i have a lot of those… and if that is the case that ain’t comin’ out honey  perhaps sheilag’s misadventures with paint might be the answer after all jeff patterson says november   at  am the thought did cross my mind that the mortar was showing through but upon further inspection the discoloring is from residue on the surface of the grout the area was indeed spotty looking before i cleaned with all the different products with that said i did recognize the grout was a bit thin in areas i might try to clean a bit more and see what happens ultimately this grout will need to be replaced and that’s an entirely different tutorial i’m still contemplating using epoxy grout since it doesn’t stain as easily as sanded grout it’s certainly trickier to install since it sets up quickly i’m up for an adventure though susan says november   at  am well good luck and tallyho… to adventure valerie welch says november   at  am epoxy grout is a royal b to install you do have to work super fast my husband and i worked together grouting our ’x′ shower and swore at the stuff but that stuff makes great grout for the floor of a shower it is not rough and porous like sanded grout and doesn’t need any more cleaning than the tile around it as it has a smooth finish like the tile if we had to do it again in a future home i might read up on some kind of release agent to coat the main surface of the tiles so the excess epoxy is easier to remove we had used × tiles on the floor and that turned out to be a lot of surface to clean off it might not be such a big deal with mosaic tiles we used a chocolate epoxy with dark brownish tiles so it had a blended look good luck if you do decide to switch to epoxy in the end it is worth the work jeff patterson says november   at  pm hi valerie i did end up using epoxy grout and it was a lot easier than i anticipated i only used it because i’ve grouted tile before and don’t mind trying new products i definitely had to work fast but overall am very happy with the results you’re right epoxy grout stays way cleaner than sanded or unsanded and doesn’t look bad i’m sold on it jtp says march   at  am i am late coming to this conversation for sure but the use and application of barkeppers friend got my attention i’ve used it forever and i keep it in one of those ketchup dispenser bottles that you can buy at the grocery store for targeted application i cut the opening off a bit for a larger output reply rich says august   at  pm httpenwikipediaorgwikimelaminefoam no chemicals in magic eraser reply valerie w says november   at  am my bathroom tiles were disgusting i had tried so many different products that it would have bankrupt a small country none of which did much if anything except wear me out smell up the house andor ruin my clothing finally one day while washing my husband’s greasy grimy work clothes i realized how clean my washer was after washing them with simple green so i decided to try it on my tiles i mixed a solution of oz cleaner to oz water sprayed the cleaner on let it soak for an hour rewet if it dries out at the end of the hour i scrubbed with a stiff brush when i wiped away the suds and dirty water the tiles  grout were white for the first time in  yrs before i moved into this house i rinsed the tiles and grout twice and then went to the store to get grout sealer i figured it’s easier to keep the tiles clean than keep tiles  grout clean i still officially hate tile in a shower reply jeff patterson says november   at  am your last sentence resonated with me valerie i feel the same way about tiles but mine is more of a lovehate relationship i hate cleaning tilesgrout but i absolutely love the way they look when i go on pinterest and see all the gorgeous showers it is inspiring i’m going to add your tip to my list at this point i’m thinking of doing a followup post just to list all the great ideas like yours reply barbara  diy home staging tips says november   at  pm the acid that’s in bar keeper’s friend is muric acid it eats through organic stuff like rust and blood and it’s only mildly abrasive but best to wear gloves magic erasers don’t have anything caustic in them it’s the abrasive nature that is hurting your skin i hear they are hell on false fingernails i blogged about magic erasers here httpdiyhomestagingtipsblogspotcomthetruthaboutmagicerasersaretheyhtml since i am always looking for ways to clean easier and more safely i am testing the vinegardawn formula i just coated my shower stall with the mixture and am waiting for the stuff to work before rubbing or scrubbing hoping it’s just rubbing reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm let us know how the dawn  vinegar work out i hope you only have to do mild rubbing too thanks for attaching your link on magic erasers it was super informative and alleviated some of the concerns i had about using them i like how you listed where to use them and where not to it was interesting to read you had the same positive cleaning experience with dollar store magic erasers good to know reply keith w says november   at  pm unfortunately tile has always been very difficult to clean after being soiled i have found that preventive medicine works the best i tiled several area in my home and to prevent having issues with grout staining i would liberally apply grout sealer the soonest possible time after grouting this seams to prevent the grout from staining and makes for easy cleanup when there are normal spills unfortunately paint and and the like will always make for difficult cleanup i believe the real remedy for cleaning grout would be to remove the old grout if it has been stained badly then seal it before use reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm good idea keith to liberally apply grout sealer to grout i would go a step further and recommend reapplying sealer every  months we have new grout and tiles in our kitchen behind the stove as you can imagine there are a lot of splashes meatball sauce explosions 😀 happen and the grout still looks fantastic sealers are super important reply joe says november   at  am another tip i think i saw it here for keeping the shower window clean was to clean it thoroughly with vinegar an baking soda…wash it off and apply rainx to the glass…keeps the water from “sticking” reply mrs hobbs says january   at  pm hi you were definitely on to something with the oxiclean i used it as a paste and it cleaned my grout back to its original clean white finish i left it on the grout for about hrs my grout was really dirty we dont think the people that laid the tile sealed it and the tile is in the kitchen…thats how dirty it was the grout is now brown then i scrubbed it w a brush and went over it with our carpet cleaner that sucks up the dirty water i only tested the grout around one tile because i didnt want to waste time and money in case it didnt work using it as a thick paste will use alot of product but the results are definitely worth it reply jeff patterson says january   at  pm that’s awesome thanks for sharing the carpet cleaner idea as a way to suck up the dirty water that’s a super efficient way to take care of a large floor like a kitchen i’d love to see before and after pictures let me know if you have any and i’d be happy to add them to this post with your name 🙂 reply mrs hobbs says january   at  pm sure i don’t see where i can add the pics and my phone isn’t letting me copy do you have an email address i can send to i also think one could get even better results if they wet the tile before adding the oxiclean paste letting it sit overnight may be an option too reply jeff patterson says january   at  pm that’s a great suggestion tooletting the oxiclean sit overnight although telling everyone in the family about this plan is probably a good idea lol i would surely forget and slide into the shower in the morning if the bathroom tile was being cleaned feel free to send the pictures to email protected add any comments you’d like me to put with the photos thanks so much for trying out this method of cleaning tiles i think it’s so cool when we can all work together to find new ways to solve problems 🙂 reply john says january   at  pm two words… grout magic there i said it i bought this product at floor and decor tile outlets in my area and i swear hands down this product was awesome i used it on my basement bathroom floor tile which was disgustingly filthy when i moved in simply squirt on the liquid and let it sit on the grout for no more than ten minutes wipe off with a damp sponge and done i’d be lying if it didn’t look brand new but you do need to reseal if you use this product you can hear it bubbling up when it activates and all the gunk gets released not a day to day cleaner for sure but use for those heavy duty jobs reply jeff patterson says january   at  pm thanks john for the recommendation if it helped you with your nasty tile grout then others might want to give it a try good to know that we’ll have to reseal the grout after using this product you should have taken some pictures so we could have seen how bad the floor was when you moved in 🙂 reply rachael mccauley says february   at  pm hi jeff i didn’t read all the responses so maybe someone already suggested this but my mom has a regular cleaning person and she shared this trick the best thing for stubborn grout stains is lysol or chlorox toilet cleaner it’s great because its a gel so it does a good job of not just running down the drain it does have the potential for staining effects and health concerns i’ve used it for the past few years and it works like a charm if it’s really terrible just put it on the night before and scrubrinse the next day we moved into an older home and one shower was seriously hideous i used the chlorox one for a while and it only went so far then i switched to lysol and it reacted to this orange layer of some kind of hard water buildup and it disappeared forever more good luck rachael reply jeff patterson says february   at  pm great ideas rachael sounds like really tough stains need the lysol toilet cleaner hopefully your hideous bathroom is now looking better 🙂 reply dwight says february   at  am the best method i have used is a steam cleaner initial investment is high but it doesn’t use chemicals at all and does a wonderful job it’s actually kinda fun to use it to clean grout we have a lot of tile and grout in our house a good steam clean followed by a sealer works great reply jeff patterson says february   at  pm that’s great advice dwight thanks so much for sharing what kind of steam cleaner do you use is it a brand that is affordable reply stephanie says april   at  pm i have a steam cleaner – it was ish at kohl’s – and it doesn’t do a darn thing for my grout maybe my grout is too far gone for steam cleaning the steam is terrific for my kitchen backsplash which is in great shape bathroom fixtures also good and cleaning the grate in the grill reply jeff patterson says april   at  pm stephanie i’ve never tried a steam cleaner for grout it sounds like there are mixed results and it could depend on how dirty the grout has gotten over time reply angie says april   at  pm i have a shark steamer that i use for most everything i have parrots and chemical cleaners of any type are strictly forbidden when i moved into my apartment i opened the shower doors to reveal the most funktastic layer of crud i had ever seen in my life seriously i wasn’t sure if i should attempt cleaning or just cordon off with police caution tape and call it a loss remembering my nana telling me about the super powers of white vinegar i grabbed a bottle and filled it with warmed white vinegar and some lemon juice sprayed onto my tile and grout let stand for about  minutes and then stormed in with my steamer like it was some sort of battle armor i watched as years of someone else’s filth just washed down the drain parrots can be champion foodflingers if it were an olympic sport i would be sharing my home with three gold medalists there is nothing more pleasant than the sight of pomegranate or fresh beets being flung onto your tan walls and tan carpeting surrounding the cage the vinegarsteamer combo has removed the toughest stains from my walls and carpeting…even the ever dreaded papaya skidmark note do not walk barefooted around a ginormous parrot cage without paying close attention to what you will inevitably stepslide on jeff patterson says april   at  pm lol thanks for the warning angie these are greats tips the usefulness of a steamer and preparedness when dealing with parrots 🙂 white vinegar is pretty amazing stuff rich says august   at  pm i agree stephaine even used vinegar in the steamer nothing reply judy gillespie says april   at  am have you ever used tilex i used it on my tile in the bathroom and it brought it back to look like new i did use a scrub brush in the areas where the grout was darker worked great reply jeff patterson says april   at  am we have judy but it really irritates my wife’s asthma tilex is a great product and certainly does a fantastic job of cleaning tiles 🙂 reply susie says april   at  pm hey y’all i just had tile with white grout installed in all of my bedrooms and bathrooms i have four cats and two dogs so the carpet had to go anyway i read somewhere that an enzymatic cleaner applied to the grout line and then covered in saran wrap until dry works wonders to bring back the white and thankfully it works i have to sometimes reapply the cleaner and saran but usually within  hours the stain is gone and there is zero elbow grease used i’ve also had great results with straight vinegar this application has worked well with any stain that has come up reply jeff patterson says april   at  pm thanks susie for the great tips can you remember the brand name for the enzymatic cleaner so that we can try it reply susie says april   at  pm it is for pet stains nature’s miracle but vinegar has worked too and not just for pet stains any area that i’ve wanted to whiten up has so far responded i do have a question too do you think that i would have to reseal areas that had straight vinegar on them reply jeff patterson says april   at  pm susie thanks for providing nature’s miracle name sealing depends on what kind you used before and how long it’s been since the last application read the directions of your sealer and see what it says our sealer says to reapply every year reply susie says april   at  pm thanks jeff i love your blog jeff patterson says april   at  pm awwww thanks susie 🙂 susie says april   at  pm you are so welcome crystal l says april   at  pm i just wanted to say i would recommend applying a smount of oxyclean directly to the stained area put a rag that is good and wet over the oxyclean and let sit i don’t know how long how ever long your comfortable waiting as you will have to do small patches at a time the longer the better as long as your rag doesn’t dry all the way then scrub i don’t guarantee it will work but i can promise you thisit is the only way to remove chocolate ice cream stains from white clothing so i give it a lot of credit reply jeff patterson says april   at  pm whoa chocolate ice stains that’s enough to get me to try your method thanks crystal for sharing 🙂 ps i love chocolate anything reply sherrie graeter says april   at  pm i just want to say that i have tried a couple of these solutions for cleaning my grout thank you for the tip for future reference the only grout i will be using will be dark lol reply jeff patterson says april   at  pm i hear ya sherrie dark grout all the way 🙂 reply susie says april   at  pm i know that everyone wants to look at tile that looks spanking new but at least with the white the grunge makes you think about the germs lurking within no maybe that’s how i rationalize my very hard to keep clean grout choice 🙁 reply diana says april   at  pm when you regrout your tiles don’t forget to use grout sealant it will also make it watertight and and prevent mold and mildew and what’s not many homes does not have the grout sealants and which they should have especially there’s water involved you can get them at home depot or other hardware stores that sell tiles and supplies reply matt michel says june   at  pm after seeing the comments i figure i’d just explain and solve all grout discolorjng for everyone grout discolor happens because it soaks through the grout all the way through no cleaner steam or anything will solve this discoloring when it has soaked through options are regrouting which isn’t that expensive or a little trick i picked up over the years is to simple rub sandpaper over the grout lines” that’s if it hasn’t soaked through” or you can stain the grout lines by simple using a water base paint or they have specific paint just for grout hope this has helped reply jeff patterson says june   at  pm thanks matt for your tips reply sara says june   at  pm i found that using white vinegar works amazing as well however sometimes you really have to scrub away has anyone tried javex that stuff works crazywell reply susie says june   at  pm hey jeff i just got a tip on how to maintain white grout from a guy in the plumbing department at home depot i’m not sure how he got there because his history is in tile installation he said to mop the floor two times a month with a  mixture of bleach and water and don’t air dry it if u do it more frequently it will yellow the grout i tried it and will say that the smell is overwhelming so opening the windows and making fast work of it is a must and it takes a few days for that bleachy smell to dissipate time will tell if it works reply jeff patterson says june   at  am susie thanks so much for your tip i love learning about new ways to keep the house especially bathroom areas clean please let me know how it works for you i guess you probably use a towel or wetdry vac to suck up the excess moisture reply susie says june   at  am hey jeff from ultra muggy tn the fantastic part about this maintenance ritual is that you don’t dry the floor i consider it soggy after i guess”swab” the floor i just leave a fan blowing on it and let the mixture soak in and slowly air dry it really doesn’t take long i would recommend keeping the pets out they wil track the bleach mixture onto your couch or carpet the results are like new grout reply sarah says july   at  am oxygrout not oxiclean but a natural product you can get from various websites is awesome i kid you not you can actually see the dirt coming out of your grout reply jeff patterson says july   at  pm thanks sarah for the great product tip it sounds like you’ve had fantastic results with oxigrout and if that’s the case it would be worth a shot reply judith wichhart says july   at  pm i use the works for showers so easy may need a little scrubbing if you have a build up after that just a spray and wipe down weekly reply shayla says august   at  pm i used lime away toilet cleaner and a scrub brush and toothbrush i put it in the grout lines and let sit till i had all grout filled and started scrubbing with the scrub brush when i finished scrubbing i let it sit  mins rinsed and any spot that it didn’t work i repeated with a toothbrush works amazing reply jeff patterson says august   at  am hi shayla thanks so much for you tutorial sounds like it will totally work plus using the toilet cleaner saves a bit of money versus buying a separate product sweet jeff reply edna friedmann says august   at  pm try using mr clean magic eraser reply faireka says august   at  pm any tip on how you clean the grout on the used tile so one can use that tile again reply jeff patterson says august   at  pm hi faireka you can try the oxiclean mixed according to the directions and see if that works there are also a ton of suggestions in the comments see which one you think might work 🙂 jeff reply stevie d says august   at  pm i use chlorox bleach mixed with water in a spray bottle and spray it on the tiles and grout and let it dry the grout turns white last about a month nothing else works as well and as cheap just vent the room for a few hours no mask necessary in my case one part bleach to  parts or so of water good luck steve reply jeff patterson says august   at  am hey steve thanks for your formula that’s super helpful i’d totally use your tip if my wife didn’t have asthma bad genes but i’ll do this for my rental properties 🙂 jeff reply c c garrason jacksonville fl says august   at  pm does anyone know if resolve carpet cleaner will harm grout of all the methods i have tried on small test lengths of grout in my ceramic kitchen tile it cleans the best and fastest haven’t been able to get an opinion on the possible longterm effects if any reply lissa says september   at  pm i recently tried resolve carpet cleaner on my grouttiles and it works……but i am also wondering what the long term effect are reply jeff patterson says september   at  pm great question lissa i don’t know the answer but you could call the company and ask them if they have any answers reply ashley says august   at  am scrubbing power is often more important than cleanser power i like for things to be very clean with little chemical presence and with minimal effort some brain storming lead me to making a drill scrub brush i’m sure i’m not the first person to think of this total cost was about  i wouldn’t use bleach with it as it will splatter but oxy clean worked great drill hole in round scrub brush screw in a bolt and fasten with a lock washer and hex nut i used a ″ insert into drill destroy grime in one of the manliest ways possible laziness is the mother of invention my kitchen floor grout is amazing and it allowed me to do as little work as possible i’m  month pregnant and my little life hack allowed me to clean my entire kitchen floor reply jeff patterson says september   at  pm hey ashley this is seriously am awesome idea thanks for sharing do you have a picture of your setup i think others might like to try it and congrats on being a mom jeff reply gina says september   at  pm i was wondering if you have put borax to the test against mildew i have used it on multiple surfaces including the grout i the shower i make a paste scrub it in and let it sit while i clean the rest of the bathroom i don’t time the “sitting” just wipe and do a quick rinse when i get back to the shower i have grout that is porous instead of the latex or nice smooth stuff in most tile baths i feel the wise guy who put this kind of grout – think grout around a pool – needs to be visited by the mildew fairy on a daily basis reply jeff patterson says september   at  am hey gina i’ve never used borax but that’s all gonna change because of you thanks so much for your tip because grout is a tough one to always keep clean i’ll give it a shot on my next cleaning round 🙂 jeff reply jeanne says september   at  am i’ve had some luck cleaning grout with a paste of bleach and baking soda letting it sit there for five minutes scrubbing it and rinsing it does remove a lot of mold and mildew i hate using harsher chemicals which have given me terrible rashes because i was dumb enough to not wear protective gloves reply renee says october   at  pm i used clr…and a toothbrush…almost like brand new grout reply jeff patterson says october   at  am great job renee clr is some strong stuff but it gets results fast jeff reply donna says october   at  am i have dark gray grout in my shower will these cleaning tips work for this as well i don’t want to use one of these suggestions if it’s going to turn my grout white all help is appreciated thanks reply sallie says october   at  am once you get it clean…the goal is to keep it that way i use a product call clean shower on the wet walls every time i take a shower the bottle sprays a fine mist i spray everything including the showerhead and curtain i have very hard calcium and lime in my well water and i started using this product as soon as my new porcelain tile shower was installed  months in and i have not had any mold growth no calcium or lime deposits and the shower looks brand new reply jeff patterson says october   at  pm thanks sallie for recommending clean shower we also have very hard water and the deposits can be a real pain in the rear end sounds like a great option for shower cleaning fanatics like us reply lisa says november   at  pm jeff did you ever try the dawn and vinegar mix on your shower tiles reply jeff patterson says november   at  pm hey lisa i didn’t because i ultimately got them clean with the oxiclean i also ended up removing all the grout and replacing it with epoxy grout man that was a chore but the grout looks great and needs very little scrubbing but i think all the ideas in this post from the fans are awesome reply leila says november   at  pm i read through all the posts and decided to try the vinegar and dawn  blue  method of cleaning my shower tiles i know i need to reseal them but i have to clean them first when you see the photos please don’t judge…i have  boys that play muddy sports and a  yr old claw foot tub with a lot of worn off enamel…i sprayed the mixture and let it set  hours as instructed  cup white vinegar heated for  seconds and added it to  cup blue dawn in a spray bottle it really worked well to take the soap residue off the tiles and chrome not so much on the grout i scrubbed with a brush and rinsed with hot water then as others suggested i used toilet bowl cleaner  i had lysol max on hand  others used clorox i let that sit  minutes and lightly scrubbed with a brush and rinsed pleased with the results and off to buy the sealer i will email the photos to jeff to add i don’t know how to add them here reply vernell says november   at  pm have you heard of wet and forte shower cleaner if so what is your opinion reply vernell says november   at  pm ooops – should be wet and forget shower cleaner also my kitchen counter was tiled but the man did not put sealer on it to our surprise now the grout is going away on some areas what is the best way to fix reply jeff patterson says november   at  am hi vernell the best way to fix this is to remove the crumbling grout and regrout it sorry to hear you’re having this problem hopefully you know what kind and color of grout was used that’ll make this project a lot easier reply jeff patterson says november   at  am hi vernell i actually did a post on wet and forget shower and love it reply connie says

ellen for your wonderful insights i hope you have a great holiday too it sounds like you have a wealth of knowledge so please add your thoughts any time i love learning new ideas every single day and hope that my fans enjoy and learn at the same time talk with you soon reply walt says december   at  pm this method reminds me of something tim allen would do on his show home improvement but it worked very well last summer i had my pressure washer out doing the outside of my house and for some reason i though i might try running a long hose through our bedroom window into the bathroom shower with a bathing suit on i started with the lowest setting and worked my way up one step which worked well except for a couple of spots in two corners it was all gone no chemicals at all and not much of a mess as a caveat we have epoxy grout which is pretty tough and it was sealed as well this might not work for everyone just thought i would throw it out reply jeff patterson says december   at  am thanks walk for sharing your cleaning adventure you’ve got some gutslol my wife would have killed me if i had done the same thing but admittedly i like your idea 🙂 i eventually regrouted this shower floor with epoxy grout it was easier than i thought and i recommend it to anyone with grout problems make sure to tell me some more diy stories i like how you think reply sandy says january   at  pm here’s a tip that worked for me i did use oxiclean powder mixing in a little water to make a paste i had to let it set overnight as my renters really did a job on the house anyway it did work and it’s worth a try reply jeff patterson says january   at  pm thanks sandy i love that stuff it’s helped me clean tiles and make grout look like new i really appreciate your tips 😉 reply lei says february   at  pm you should try awesome it works on just about anything and on the toughest stains its harsh smelling but it works even on pee stains and its only a at the dollar tree no where else to be sold reply jeff patterson says february   at  pm thanks lei for your tip i’ll have to check it out next time we’re at store sad to say but pee stains are tough to get out although i did manage to clean up a toilet seat using oxiclean i dipped the edge of the seat into an oxiclean mixture with water and it did a great job but thanks for the awesome tip reply ben harriman says january   at  pm urine stains on toilet seats can new removed with urine gone spray on a piece of kleenex or toilet paper and apply to toilet let stand and keep wetting with urine gone which has a spray attachment workds on carpets etc reply landa says february   at  pm hello have you heard of coat of armor grout solutions this is what it says on their website “all our products and cleaners have no harmful chemicals they are waterbased and biodegradable” i personally have not tried it but i am going to purchase the kit today hope it works reply jeff patterson says february   at  am i haven’t heard of this product landa if you don’t mind please let me know how it works because this could be a neat product to try and share with everyone thanks so much for letting me know about it 😀 reply dee says february   at  pm i just finished cleaning my ceramic tiles  grout with fantastik with scrubbing bubbles using a scrub brush spray it on scrub it in and let it sit for  minutes or so wipe clean and rinse with clean water reply ann says february   at  pm i’m about to try some of the cleaning formulas suggested but wanted to know if anyone has tried these on colored grout i have green grout to match to our tiles the grout has white spots from the hard water and recently developed mildew i’m concerned that oxyclean will “bleach” the colored grout and that too much scrubbing will damage the grout reply jeff patterson says february   at  pm hi ann really great question oxiclean shouldn’t bleach your grout since it’s not a traditional bleach here’s the faq for oxiclean and it has a lot of good answers httpwwwoxicleancomfaqaspx reply kch says february   at  am in my  year plus battle with shower grout the only thing that gets shower grout to look like new is new grout bleach works for awhile no dilution but then it starts to yellow the grout basically what i’ve learned is that once it’s colored it’s done anything you do to try to clean it just destroys it more just read on a blog that you’ve got to dry your shower with a towel after each “wetting” to keep new grout looking clean good luck reply zinco says march   at  pm great site – thanks everyone today i did a side by side comparison of quite a few methods most recommended some elsewhere lots of mildew mold and scum in an old shower with tiled walls a glass block wall and tiled floor so lots of grout mostly white except the floor which is beige grout for my purposes i wanted something that would work within an hour or less if possible impatient maybe all applied then used a toothbrush to rub them in why so many old ones lying around rank ordering of the results a clorox cleanup has bleach – a spray quick to work and the whitest cleanest results this is weak bleach plus other materials odor was not overpowering like straight bleach but definitely there  b blanco cleaner no bleach it is a stainless steel cleaner and polisher probably like bar keepers friend but in liquid form this was very close to the clorox no bleach smell easy to apply with a toothbrush and fast acting  comet cleanser also very good probably due to the bleach and abrasive but less convenient to apply than the other two  stainzrout grout spotter — it has a dabberscrubber atop the bottle which is supposed to help but it actually makes it almost impossible to contact the grout due to the shoulders of the glass blocks especially when i squeezed some onto the toothbrush and applied it it was pretty effective but third place  sunlight dishwasher powder fairly good but not convenient  the vinegar  dawn solution much worse than the others easy to use worked fine of soap scum glass etc but very little effect on the mould in the grout not not blue dawn only had purple same as the above but also added some bicarbonate of soda this one was the most fun – reminded me of my daughter’s volcano experiment in grad school science project days great visual effects but not so much on the cleaning hope this helps others thanks again reply jeff patterson says march   at  am what a great summary thank you so much for sharing your hard work i think this will totally help a ton of fans and certainly aid us all with our groutmold issues i’m so impressed keep up the great work 🙂 reply andrea says march   at  pm hi can you tell me how to clean grout between white tiles ina shower that has been stained with pink hair dye nothing is working it is a rented house we need a cheap option reply jeff patterson says march   at  am hi andrea you shout give oxiclean a try it’s about  and i have a tutorial on how to use it here’s the link and i hope it works for your hair dye issue httphrtllcwpenginecomthebestwaytocleangrout reply jill says june   at  am to get hair dye off anything as quickly as you see it use peroxide you can even try after it’s been there a while if no luck with that get bleach for bleaching hair be careful wear gloves and make sure you have good ventilation too i know this was a long time ago but i have a lot of experience with this and thought i would share reply walt says march   at  am i tried the bleach and it worked to some extent i was at a home show recently and got a product called bring it on cleaner it is sold by a company called touch of oranges canada it worked great it also worked for the soap scum on my glass shower doors thought i’d come back here and let you know about it reply jeff patterson says march   at  pm thanks walt for letting us know about bring it on that’s really cool do you know if it can be bought at the store reply missi says april   at  am baking soda and of course vinager it works great reply jeff patterson says april   at  am thanks missi 🙂 reply abbii says april   at  pm we have just put in a new bathroom complete with tile and grout on the walls because my husband thought it would make for better resale down the road he put some kind of grout protector in the grout before he layered it we wipe it down with a squeegee getting old and it has only been a week each time but my question is what can i use to keep it clean and white that won’t strip any of the good stuff out of the grout would the dawn vinegar mix work as an every week cleaner or is there something not toxic that is better reply jeff patterson says april   at  pm i’ve fallen in love with oxiclean abbii it won’t bleach your tile or grout and is pretty easy to use check out this tutorial and let me know what you think httphrtllcwpenginecomthebestwaytocleangrout reply mona cicciarella says april   at  pm i use vim with bleach and a dollar store scrub brush works great clean grout like new reply jeff patterson says april   at  pm thanks mona for your tips 🙂 reply george says june   at  pm hi i tried everything including the super tile cleaner from loew’s but it was with the two cups of powdered oxiclean in a gallon of hot ho that did a great job of removing all the darkened soap stains from all the tiles and grout in our shower floor it took about a two hour time period with intervals of scrubbing with a wooden scrub brush on a pole and rewetting with the mixture about every  minutes it looks as good as it did  years ago when it was brand new thanks for not only a great solution but for a solution that really works great reply jeff patterson says june   at  pm that’s fantastic george thanks for letting me know about your success it’s takes a bit of elbow grease but the results are unparalleled reply liz says june   at  pm hi i was looking for tips on how to get shower tile clean but my tiles are on the walls so i couldn’t use your method since such a solution would simply not “sit” on the tiles however i wanted to share my method of getting the grout clean in between the tiles i mix baking soda with bleach ratio about  so i get a paste it’s not rocket science i just mix it until i feel that it’s thick enough not to run off but not too thick to make it difficult to apply i then cover the grout with it and let it sit overnight about  hours i then scrub with a wet small wire brush and it comes out white i have looked for something for a long time and i found this tips on the internet somewhere and figured i’d try it i was amazed at the result it’s the only method that has really worked to clean up at least  years worth of discoloration i also use it on the discolored caulking between the tub and the walls but of course i use a soft brush in that area it doesn’t come out as good but it’s sure a lot better than before reply jeff patterson says june   at  pm liz this is super awesome thanks so much for your tips i’m sure that a ton of people will find this to be helpful i love learning about different ways to clean and you have a gem reply chris says july   at  pm liz and jeff httpwwwstructuretechcommoldyshowercaulk reply jeff patterson says july   at  am thanks so much chris this is a wonderful resource reply judie s says june   at  am hi jeff love lovelove the help and suggestions you have great…commenters i have more of a preventative idea we used for flooring but could relate to bathroom and kitchen tile years ago i was watching a tv show where they were showcasing a lady’s house in arizona where the dirt is that beautiful red color she had tile floors and the grout she had put in was the exact color of the red dirt i never forgot her quote “use grout that is the color of dirt” it’s such a time and energy saver about five years ago we had slate floors put in real slate not manufactured…lots of different shades natural colors i picked grout that is “the color of dirt” a medium gray color they sealed the floor with an oilbased sealer looks great easy to clean not worried about the gray ever getting darker in some areas because it would blend right in on the other hand we had epoxy grout put in in our tiled kitchen counters we have big tiles with small grout lines even epoxy grout gets dirty because the grout sits the smallest fraction of an inch below the tiles and is not perfectly smooth i’m going to try the oxi clean and blue dawn on concoction on the tiles with a brush unfortunately i didn’t get “grout the color of dirt” because i was told epoxy grout doesn’t stain it does however get dirty over time thankfully my tile is a sort of mottled beigy grayish pale brownish color so the dirty grout blends in with the tiles the tile is prettier than my description just remember “grout the color of dirt” ps as an aside oilbased sealer for a slate floor is more expensive and apparently sold in smaller quantities than waterbased sealer but the end result is worth it we compared two ’x′ patches on the floor the oilbased sealer added a richness and depth to the floor that the waterbased sealer couldn’t touch i imagine oil based lasts longer too thanks again for all you do reply jeff patterson says june   at  pm judie thank you so much for your comment i love the idea of getting a grout color the same as dirt it would help out a lot with cleaning thanks also for your suggestion about the oil based sealer i love oil based products because they are so resilient and last a long time and a lot of questions come up with regard to slate so this is perfect keep me posted on your progress 🙂 reply crystal says june   at  am the miracle i have found to clean grout was a cheap toilet bowl cleaner called the works   a bottle  all the dirt foams up from grout an wipes up smell is a bit strong an use gloves but i have been amazed please dont try this on fine line grout but the bigger floor tile grout reply jeff patterson says june   at  am thanks crystal i’ve seen other people recommend the works as well it’s helped clean their grout as well i stayed away from it because of the strong odor my wife has really bad asthma the other concern i had was how it would react with the tile but there’s no reason not to test it on a small section of tile and grout 🙂 reply robert johnson says august   at  pm a pumice stone will remove the stains easily reply jeff patterson says october   at  pm great tip robert reply lorraine says august   at  am i cleaned stained bathroom floor grout with a stuff brush and a tube of crest complete ‘extra whitening’ toothpaste just added a dollop as needed to grout lines and gave a good scrub immediate results smelled good too try it reply jeff patterson says august   at  am great job lorraine thanks for sharing this tip because its super simple and doesn’t cost a ton of money i think it’ll help a ton of people 🙂 reply pat gaudreau says august   at  am hi jeff and everyone who wants to clean their grout i also have tried everything on the store shelves that promise to clean my grout including an acid wash needless to say nothing worked enough to make my grout look consistently clean and the same color throughout until one day i was cleaning my stove top with a white magic bar and i thought why not give it a try on my kitchen floor grout here is where the angels sing the rainbow is above my house and the birds are singing a beautiful song…the magic bar truly worked like magic my grout looks brand new you will go through quite a few so buy a dozen or more they are inexpensive and worth it wet the bar and scrub the grout i did it in sections and had a clean bucket of water and sponge which i used to wipe off the dirt and whatever chemicals are in the magic bar once the grout dries it looks great but you are not done yet you must seal your now clean and dry grout with grout sealer home depot and lowe’s sell a sealer that comes in a bottle with a brush on the top i use a steamer at least once a week to wash my floor and i now only have to deep clean my grout once a year using the process above reply jeff patterson says august   at  am whoa i’m willing to give this a shot pat are you referring to a magic eraser or is there a different product i’d love to know since you obviously got out of this world results thanks so much for sharing this 🙂 reply erica says october   at  pm our  month old accidentally got into our pantry cupboard and dropped a jar of lemon juice which broke and spilled all over the floor we weren’t able to get to it to clean it up for about  minutes and when we wiped it up our very dirty grout changed to perfectly white no scrubbing we only wiped it up with paper towels and an added bonus is that our kitchen smelled nice and lemony now i’m thinking about spilling it purposefully all over the rest of our floor reply jeff patterson says october   at  am lol it’s funny how accidents can lead to good things glad your  month old didn’t get hurt by any glass i wonder if we could add the lemon juice to a spray bottle and use it to clean hmmm that might be a good tutorial 😀 thanks erica reply debbie says october   at  pm i have found the best way to clean grout is by mixing peroxide with baking soda to make a paste and scrub grout with an old toothbrush or larger brush if needed clean up with clear water or mop floor if needed works great reply jeff patterson says october   at  am thanks so much debbie for your awesome tip do you have a specific amount of peroxide and baking soda that you find to be a good recipe reply maureen says november   at  pm my sister recently had a professional company come out to shampoo her carpet they told her how to clean the tile and grout they advised to use baking soda and vinegar reply elise says november   at  am you need to strip your grout sealer off clean the grout using a paste made from b on am i and then reseal 🙂 the blotch in essence if because some spots are still sealed 🙂 hope that helps reply elise says november   at  am “bon ami” – sorry – autocorrect it’s a super cheap mineral cleaner works like a charm reply rob delafo says november   at  pm for commercial or residential really tough like  years tough…basic cleaner then finish off with a steam cleaner and metal brush in unison did not damage the floor tiles i worked on a ft x ft floor so i needed to speed things up a bit so at the same time i used a drill with wire brush and steam cleaner at the same time……kick ass no damage but still requires elbo grease if very dirty reply brenda says december   at  pm i use grout pens on my discolored grout looks great and no more yucky stains you can get them at home depot lowes and probably walmart love them reply jeff patterson says december   at  am thanks brenda for your tip are you referring to the paintable grout pens or is this a cleaning product reply claire bryson says december   at  pm hi jeff i found the very best solution for cleaning grout – beatsall this really works just squirt it onto the grout and scrub i bought a special thin scrubber then rinse clean it is magic i am in florida and can get it at my local hardware store but i believe you can find it on line reply cindy says december   at  pm i just cleaned a shower we haven’t used in years with baking soda and water mixed into a paste about like peanut butter applied into the grout and let sit for  mins and then use a wet tooth brush to work paste into grout and rinse you will need to rinse a few times to remove baking soda repeat on tough grout stains as needed talk about cheap  non toxic…merry christmas reply kackie says january   at  am thanks for doing that experiment i used “kaboom no drip foam for mildew and mold stain remover wbleach” and it worked great i only tested a small area with a tough stain and the smell wasn’t too much hope this helps reply les says january   at  am how about vinegar and a small amount of baking soda let the fizzle die down then use either in a spray bottle or a bucket heard that it is good for black mold and stuff also give it a good rinse after letting it sit for awhile reply jeff patterson says january   at  pm thanks les i also love this method 😀 reply rachel johnson says january   at  pm i’m not sure if i should reveal such tricks of the trade but by now it’s probably already been mentioned as a professional house cleaner i use “the works” toilet bowl cleaner to clean showers which have disgusting tile and grout filled with soap scum and mold the reason this works is because it uses muriatic acid instead of bleach i also have a truck mounted tile and grout cleaner and when we clean tile and grout we use…guess what…muriatic acid it’s the stuff they clean pools with we charge between  and  cents per sq ft so  for that lady to get her floors steam cleaned is about average but it’s not something you can’t do yourself the acid can be combined in a sprayer with equal part water and scrubbed with a stiff bristle brush but sometimes just pouring it on does the trick i’ve splashed it on my skin it stings but it washed right off never ever try to smell it but the  to  water combo takes the edge off to a very tolerable level onc the grout is clean you just mop it off doing this in small sections is easy and i don’t even need safety equipment reply website says january   at  am the tiles in my bathroom looks awful the problem is that the water is hard and the tiles and the grouts look dirty i am glad that you share this post i will try these cleaners for sure soho carpet cleaners ltd reply lee says january   at  am jeff we been trying a lot of different things to clean the grout but we found this works very well take a mixture of baking soda and add some hydrogen peroxide available in the drug store to it to make a paste then apply it to the grout it also cleaned up along the caulk lines and inside the shower door tracks i used an old toothbrush but you can use some other type of brush let it set about  min then scrub with toothbrush and rinse it worked great i also used it on my shower doors we also have hard water and cleaned them right up hope this help others reply ldj jones says january   at  am jeff my parents has this problem in their shower i used two products each one day apart they both have a strong odor so maybe do it when your wife is out of the house for the day make sure you have a great deal of ventilation there is a product called zep if works wonders i ordered it from amazon spray and leave on and come back in  minutes and wipe this should clean it all if you still have issues get kaboom and spray the following day leave for  minutes and the grout should be clean after doing all of this hard work be sure to seal the grout after it has dried reply abbe harms says february   at  am as part of my job as house steward at chamounix mansion international youth hostel i do a good part of the housekeeping and supervise the others who do it we have had a chronic problem with shower tile grout and i am interested in trying the dawn blue recipe other products and combinations of products throughout the blog on this issue have been tried in the past with soso results one thing that you may want to investigate in your own homes is whether or not you have rust or iron in your water we do it’s apparant in some places like clean water outlet around rim of toilet bowl where you will see pink to orange stains ironrust is a different ball of wax however on the grout the usual rust stain removers lime away for one which works great on other rust stains do not work on porous unsealed grout i do not have an answer to the problem and maybe the dawn blue recipe will work i just wanted to throw that out there as a possible roadblock to grout getting any cleaner if anyone has had experience with this problem and knows of a successful method of tackling please do tell i am bored to tears trying to get that grout clean thanks reply will says march   at  pm i have a shower that has nasty tile and grout what can i use for deep cleaning reply vincenza says march   at  am we adopt the grannies’ solutions in italy which are ecofriendly and not too expensive as well here is one of these alternatives  potato starch and hydrogen peroxide phase  plus water and white vinegar phase  – the starting pastemixture is simple and composed three coffeespoons of starch and one tablewine glass of hydrogen peroxide time after time get ready as much as paste as you need use a teethbrush to spread generously the mixture on the surface to be cleaned and leave it work for one hour then get ready a liquidmixture with one liter hot water and one glass vinegar use this mixture and a sponge to rinse the surface out then rinse the surface again with water and wipe the surface ps the vinegar smells a little indeed but this won’t last long about thirty minutes moreover vinegar is a powerful antilimescale and somehow disinfectant too reply cyn says april   at  pm i have a septic system that i have to keep alive so i can’t use bleach or any other toxic chemical that will kill the bacteria in the system so i had to find something different i found pouring coke on the tilegrout shower floor swooshing it around so it is evenly distributed and then walking away to do something else for  minutes works for me when i return to scrub it’s a quick scrub with a hand brush not much effort at all and then rinse it all down the drain good thing is it doesn’t cost that much to try it and decide for yourself reply cathy says april   at  am hi jeff what is the solution or maybe a home remedies in a tile discoloration due to a toilet bowl cleaner cause i think the glaze has been stripped off the black tile turns to white  hope you can help me reply mika says june   at  pm i’ve used pert shampoo and it worked for me plus it’s not so hazardous on the lungs spread the pert shampoo directly on the tile and grout don’t dilute it with water then use a scrub sponge to spread it more evenly and work it in cleans up the grout and the tile i also use it on the faucets mirrors and our acrylic tub reply julia says june   at  am thank you so much for your video ideas and all the comments black yucky grout in the shower has been driving me crazy for a while and i’m going to try several of these ideas and see what works got a good tip from pinterest for maintenance make some of the dawnvinegar solution and put it in one of those scrubby dish things the ones where you put the soap in the handle keep it in your shower and each day scrub a small area while you’re in there showering i’m not too good at cleaning grout on a regular basis but i can do a minute or two per day while i’m in there anyway seems like a good way to do upkeep… now if i can just get it “deep cleaned” reply julie says june   at  pm don’t forget to reseal your grout after all that hard scrubbing or it will stain faster that it did in the first place and will probably not get as clean the second time around someone may have said this but i didn’t read all the responses… 🙂 reply amazin says july   at  pm i found the answer but you won’t like it after  years of trying to clean the grout i finally took a hammer to it my newly renovated bathroom is gorgeous – and no dirty grout now to find a way to keep it looking like that reply nikki says july   at  pm i found a perfect solution  get a box of brillo brand soaped steel wool biodegradable  all natural wet one and scrub for glass scrub and then wipe with a damp paper towel for tile  tub scrub until you see a grey stain on smoother parts of the tub then rinse or wipe with paper towel  get a package of bon ami all natural powder also ecofriendly – basically baking soda plus some other minerals get a tooth brush for the grout and a larger brush for the tub scrub with the brushes until the stains are out rinse  repeat if necessary this method is completely ecofriendly and requires a lot less effort when scrubbing than with bleach and other products reply sarah says august   at  pm hi everyone thank you for all of your superhelpful tips and info i too try to keep the cleaning products as natural as possible last month however we were moved out of our apartment and had a nice security deposit depending on the results of the cleaning needless to say i seriously relaxed my reluctance to use chemical i tried all of the usual methods but the shower grout was still nasty in that corner by the faucets and around the fixtures – you know the parts that never really get totally clean what finally worked was the clorox “pen” grout cleaner i worked wonders it is easy to apply because you just hold it like a pen and squeeze it on the grout it is a thick gel so it stays where you put it it stays wet it doesn’t get all over you and it doesn’t smell – unless you put it right up to your face so don’t do that ok  i put it on and left it for as long as it took me to clean the floor and it wasn’t enough time i put on some more and then got distracted and forgot about it so it sat for maybe  min or soand when i came back i just rinsed it with the shower hose and to my suprise and delight the grout was sparkly clean it did cost a couple bucks but it did not require any elbow grease and one pen was enough to do most of one wall of my tub shower and it probably could have done more but i really put it on thick sorry if someone already mentioned this i only read about half of the comments but they were so helpful i wanted to share what worked for me thank you and be well reply sarah says august   at  pm just in case this helps anyone – for the bathroom mirror – after i clean it i use rainx antifog it is for the inside of the car windshield it comes in a liquid and wipes the liquid is easier but the wipes work too it keeps the mirror from fogging up from the shower steam which keeps hubby from wiping it “clean” with his hand or towel after he showers so that he can shave the mirror stays super clean for a week or so then i windex and rainx and we’re good to go for another week and i get to look like a magical wizard reply lee says august   at  pm if your grout is in tact and just stained you might want to try the polyblend grout renew product you can get it in numerous different colors it has the color and a sealer in it my bathroom floor had to be regrouted due to cracks and crevices but the wrong color was used so i used this product and it brought the bright white color back but did not fill in the cracks and crevices as i had hoped that’s another story i am going to regrout the whole floor to fix that one warning with this stuff is to stay in the grout lines as much as possible and don’t let it dry fully before you get the excess off the tiles themselves with the sealer in the mix it takes a lot of cleaning to get it off the tiles it is a good product when used properly and brings back the new look in the grout lines reply ron says september   at  pm on cleaning grout in shower windex and a quickie nylon grout brush get the job done but sprayway glass cleaner scrubbed in with a quickie brush is easier and better reply theresa says september   at  am jeff finally a blog i can understand as a woman trying to do boy jobs thank you i have tried several “recipes” for cleaning grout what worked great for me was magic eraser…however cleaning roughly  sq ft of floor grout on hands and knees is quite cumbersome and painful on the knees i am in the process of removingredoing that silicone strip in the shower and looking forward to trying the dawn recipe to clean the grout…baby steps first next…maybe that  sq ft floor reply pat ryan says september   at  am i am on your site getting info for next projectwalkin shower grout and am going to start with vinegar and dawn solution thought i could add one tip though at  with emphysema physical effort is the problem often i use a rechargeable toothbrush and save the old brush whenever i replace and use this for spot scrubs on stove or any timei i needed more scrubbing power than i can supply just a thought reply rich says september   at  am i didn’t read every comment so this topic might have been discussed in reading it appears that the key is to clean it often to prevent the more stubborn stains but my questions is after using comet or oxiclean or bleach should we reseal the grout each time doesn’t the scrubbing remove any sealant as well as the discoloration reply nicol says september   at  am i read some of your comments because i had the same problem i tried about everything available on the market but nothing made the grout spotless no matter how much i scrubbed so i decided to try the clothing steamer  just the steam without any detergent wow now the grout looks brand new the steam melts and washes away everything i will purchase the multipurpose steamer because it can be used to clean and disinfect almost everything try it you will not be disappointed reply jen says october   at  pm after reading all of this i headed off to the store to buy an assortment of supplies to try these various recipes that might help me clean my grout the first mixture i tried was hydrogen peroxide and baking soda mixed in a ratio that gave me a slightly liquid toothpaste texture i could not believe how well this worked i wish i could load the pictures i took to show the results i just mixed up a small batch made from these two items total cost of about  cents and used an old toothbrush to scrub the grout on my bathroom floor in a matter of seconds it started working and went from a tanbrown color to almost pristine white i wiped it down with a rag soaked in hot water and that was it the tile in my bathroom is the original ceramic tile from when the house was built in  about  inch squares it will be a tedious task to scrub all of this by hand but as inexpensive as the homemade cleaner is and as well as it worked i will put the time in to do it it has made a huge difference reply jose says october   at  pm formula  degreaser works pretty well – some elbow grease is required though reply robert says october   at  pm mix baking soda with water to make a paste in a spray bottle mix a cup of white vinegar and a cup of water apply the baking soda paste to the grout you want to clean after you have all the paste on it doesn’t matter if some gets on the tile spray on the watervinegar solution put enough on so you can see the baking soda bubbling let sit for  minutes or so – then use a stiff bristle brush like a large toothbrush and scrub you will literally see brownish gunk coming off scrub all your grout this way – and then wipe down a couple of times with water to get all the baking soda off you might have to do this twice in some areas i did two bathrooms and a kitchen this way after having  years of renters and the tile and grout look almost new reply lg says december   at  am thank you robert i hate the mess and time and rinsing work your suggestion involves but love everything else the purity of ingredients the very smart cost effectiveness and the results you describe will definitely try this reply jan says october   at  am i am from australia we don’t seem to have the same named cleaning products as you have my husband used a steam cleaner which did a marvellous job on the grout they aren’t expensive might be worth a try reply pat wagenbrenner says november   at  pm use jubilee…it works wonders put it on with a sponge and then wipe with a clean dry cloth i ordered it on line reply jeff patterson says november   at  am hmm i’ll have to look that up pat thanks for the great tip 😀 reply jeanna banks says december   at  pm my favorite tile and grout cleaners are peroxide and baking sodait works wonders for me reply lg says december   at  am  thank you for the helpful thread my inexperienced  cents– sigh i live in a “prewar” nyc studio apartment translation old with a typical windowless bathroom tile  grout is original uh  white  black small amazingly strong but does not look new– the best cleanser i have ever used zero elbow greasescrubbing necessary is called kaboom tile cleaner cartoonpurple liquid in a spray bottle truly zero scrubbing necessary amazing sadly it is scary to use because even i with no history of asthma or lung weakness get a constricted upper chest and the smell persists for a few days– worrisome i decided to err on the side of caution and not use it anymore so hard to give up the ‘no scrubbing’ though instead i now use a terrific cleanser already mentioned on this thread bar keeper’s friend i buy both the powder and the liquid it’s not as powerful as some and it involves more work both scrubbing and significant rinsing sigh but it’s safe and does not smell badly thanks again for the thread reply tony says december   at  am well jeff after three years of tips and tricks suggested in this blog did you ever get your grout clean to your satisfaction  if so what works the best  did you have to regrout reply melania says december   at  am if you like over the counter “oxy cleaner” then you should try stain solver you can view the videos and information at stainsolvercom i’ve used this to remove years of grime on the grout in the kitchen and dining room and then sealed it sorry no pictures as we lost that house in a tornado in  but after the tornado immediately ordered to replace it it removed mold and blood from carpet and clothes removed mystery stains from the carpet at the place we were renting while rebuilding the owner was amazed because she had even paid a professional to come in and clean the carpet i have nothing to do with the company just know that t works and is stronger than the otc brand reply maria says december   at  pm re tile and grout cleaner here in the uk we have such a thing as a white grout pen that you just go over dirty discoloured grout and it comes in white as far as i know there isn’t another colour available although i must say that i haven’t looked just of late thanks for all your sound advice and tips …… reply jeff patterson says december   at  pm thanks maria for your tip that’s always a good option to try before removing the grout i’ve seen pens like that here in the states 😀 reply puddleglum says december   at  am tile and grout are enemies of sanity time money and marriage remodel at least the tubshower put in fiberglass or other solid surface replacement unit and never install grout in wet areas spray and wash clean for the next  years bathroom becomes a joy not a chore mold and mildew spores gone bathrooms done and still going strong      reply deb says january   at  pm just tried the dawn  vinegar approach on my black and white ceramic tile tubshower never again it did hardly anything for the grout so i made a vinegar  baking soda paste which helped however i wouldn’t ever attempt this unless you have a way to spray or flood the area that little direction “rinse” is about impossible when using dawn vinegar  baking soda are easier to rinse away reply bina says february   at  pm barkeepers friend liquid will clean up grout lines soap scum and even water spots on shower doors fixtures and glass i run hot water for a couple minutes to heat up everything then scrub with a grout brush and rinse repeat if necessary works amazing i’ve cleaned hundreds of properties with this stuff don’t know how i lived without it before reply bill says june   at  pm i just tried bkf on the badly yellowed grout lines in my shower and it did a better job than everything else i’ve tried using including the hot vinegar with dawn the original grout was  years old when i bought the house and developed the same yellow color a few years later getting the grout back to white was impossible so i cut it out and regrouted with some acrylic liquid added that was supposed to keep mildew from growing on the grout i believe that the acrylic is reacting with something to cause it to yellow because each time i remove the slight yellow hue it returns within a year i use a mixture of vinegar and borax to clean my tiled showers and floors one shower that i regrouted the same way hasn’t yellowed a bit yet it’s in the bathroom that has the most cosmetics and personal care products used the yellowed bath sees little use except as a restroom the tile and grout lines in it are squeaky clean so i’m just going to use some grout paint and be done with it reply maggie says february   at  am my kitchen floor large area had cushion tiles some with little chips and had sanded grout with was filthy looking no matter what i tries i passed a truck with ” grout doctor” on the side…i couldn’t wait to call he cam out and on his hands and knees scrubbed the tile and grout he carefully replaced some damaged rile and when the time was right he used a wonderful grout stainpaint it is still fabulous  years later reply jeff patterson says february   at  am that’s awesome maggie was it a reasonable price i’ve seen outfits like that and always wondered how much they charge reply jules says february   at  pm a friend told me to use oven cleaner so i purchased the ticket fumeless kind sprayed a section let stand  min and used a scrubber to clean up the grout did great for me reply jeff patterson says february   at  am hmmm good to know jules thanks so much for sharing reply josefina says june   at  pm i used cascade liquid gel put cascade all over the floor of your shower and leave it overnight the following morning water your shower using a broom to get rid of the cascade gel and your tile grout will be white again be careful not to use blue or orange cascade gel or any colored one use the white or transparent one reply jeff patterson says june   at  pm nice tips josefina thanks for sharing 🙂 reply marie tabler says june   at  pm for the mildewed grout in our shower tile i unrolled cotton balls and soaked them in bleach and applied them to the grout i left them on for hours it took a while to apply them and i did it in sections but all my grout looks new again it even worked on the mildewed caulk reply jeff patterson says june   at  pm grate tips marie thanks so much for sharing 🙂 reply kerry l says june   at  pm i have used a paste of baking soda and bleach using a cheap brush from the dollar store and an old plastic small container i added baking soda to  cup liquid bleach making a paste consistency brushed it on and let it set for  minutes wow clean bright white grout againtry it… reply jen says june   at  am i discovered inadvertently while at a customer’s home i do home cleaning for a living that your best bet on grout if harsh doesn’t bother you is to use “the works” original toilet bowl formula get that on the floor or even tile walls scrub two or three minutes on each area in succession and be sure to rinse as you go this stuff is very harsh but it works on the slightly less unhealthy side i recommend mixing barkeepers friend powder with simple green and that solution will really remove almost any dirt grime mildew soap scum or stain at all besides things like paint or gum or things like that which are best reserved for “goof off” also if you go the route of “the works” avoid getting it on any fixtures for any length of time as it will discolor and ruin the appearance of them especially stainless steel reply jeff patterson says july   at  pm thanks jen for the tips yah the works is potent my wife couldn’t take the fumes hence my experimentation thank you 🙂 reply toni says october   at  pm we recently put in a tile shower and were told by the tile guy in business for more than  years to absolutely not use harsh chemicals it will break down your grout and it will need to be replaced he recommended a quick spray with a vinegar solution and quick wipe down after each use i use  white vinegar and water with a couple droppers of lemon essential oil the smell goes away in no time reply ken anselm says december   at  pm jeff i found your site while looking for an answer on how to clean some dirty commercial ceramic tile this time of year i often help my brother out by cleaning the floors at some of the many commercial accounts in which his company provides service for he recently mentioned he could not get the ceramic tile at one of his accounts to come perfectly clean i also have recently been testing oxy clean on a number of different hard surfaces although i never had tried it for cleaning ceramic tile and grouting i have also has some luck with this product on some other surfaces so i think i should give it a try with one minor change i own a window cleaning and soft washing company and use what is called deionized water to clean and rinse glass i think this water could help you and possibly my brother yield perfect results when cleaning ceramic tile in my industry the water is used to avoid having to squeegee the glass while still providing perfect spotless results i know it sounds too good to be true but it most definitely is not me being the curious type i wanted to know why it worked after doing some reading about di water online and talking with an expert on di water i think i have the answer in a nutshell and the way i understand it is the di water helps release a molecular bond between the dirt and the surface in which you are cleaning it from i know this water is harder for someone who is not from my industry to come by so this week when i help my brother clean the problem ceramic tile at one of his accounts i will test the di water with the oxy clean in conjuction with a hot water extraction unit in theory the extraction unit will spray the tile with a light pressure and mimic the light scrubbing i will let you know how it fairs reply ken anselm says january   at  pm jeff the results from my testing are as follows it appears that when i did a test of di water di water and dish soap and di water with oxy clean that the di water alone had descent results but when combined with oxyclean it had near perfect results this was some rearly old and hard to clean tile i attempted to leave a url but i believe it was removed if you are interested in the pictures that clearly show the results please don’t hesitate to ask reply jvn says january   at  am hi jeff just stumbled across your blog i run a sorority –  active young ladies use our showers on a daily basis dirty discolored grout is definitely an issue about two years ago i discovered the power of oxi clean and you’re right there’s a trick to it i’ve found that if you dampen the floor slightly then sprinkle straight oxi on it being sure to cover the grout with a nice layer spray a little water over it so that it becomes damp and pasty all over then wait overnight and scrub with a stiff brush even the worst stains will come out reply pingback how to build a ceramic shower stall  information pingback how to clean bathroom shower tile grout

at  pm wow never have seen so many “remedies” for cleaning tile and grout in showers and bath rooms be aware that both tile and grout are porous and absorb water for tile and grout we spray fantastic on a section leave it for  seconds and use a nylon brush to scrub the area…do a section at a time then just wipe down with paper towelingno rinsing after mold on grout is a fungus and has roots that are below the visual surface get a tile grout brush sized for the job mix up clorox according to directions use a floor fan to ventilate and a window exhaust fan if necessary scrub grout with this solution wait  minutes then using a larger nylon brush go over the section and rinse with a damp sponge if no improvement is made you can buy a dremel tool and get a carbide tapered bit with a ″ tip and remove ″ of the stained grout surface area wear hearing protection and a dust mask then regrout with an epoxy formulated type then get a good sealer and apply to the tile and the grout you want to make sure that where the tile walls of a shower meet the floor to use a waterproof grout that will not crack i use ge ii silicone on that perimeter and it will not get mildew for  years according to ge so epoxy grout on the shower floor and the ge on the perimeter on the walls if you regrout you can use red devil premixed tile grout that is excellent as it is a very fine sand type seal regrouted areas the spray and forget product is good and you can mix up that for maintainence to control shower mildew that’s about all i can say hope it helps reply michele says may   at  pm i know this seems weird but clorox toilet bowl cleaner with bleach use the handy angled head to lightly fill the grout wait  to  min and rinse with water you can wipe vigourously with a washcloth if needed…but i’ve done my entire house and haven’t had to “scrub” too many areas if you do this on tile that doesn’t have an easy rinse availablility use a damp washcloth to wipe up reply karen s says july   at  am yep the mixture of  cup blue dawn dish soap and  cup vinegar worked on the tile for me and the glass is sparkling but how does one get rid of the heavy heavy thick amount of soap afterwards i would have liked to have had a power washer in there to help…say how would a power washer be on the tile reply jeff patterson says july   at  am wouldn’t recommend a powerwasher inside the house it’ll get messy and there’s no way to know if the subfloor is waterproofed eg with ditra heavy rinsing the old fashioned way with a bucket of water would be a good option have you tried softscrub it’s also a good option reply ann says july   at  pm hi jeff – i have light grey colored grout in my shower area walls and floor i tried to read through all the comments but there are a lot do you know if oxiclean would strip the color i know i can do a test spot first but wondering if you have used it on colored grout thanks reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required
