more photo katy raddatz the founders fund emerges as venture capital   how entrepreneurs get money and time for startups is changing    back to gallery behind the internets roaring comeback is a new generation of investors experimenting with the way silicon valley startups get founded and funded chief among them is peter thiel a yearold maverick money manager who in the past four years has turned his  million payout from the sale of the paypal online payment service he cofounded into a growing financial fiefdom he runs clarium capital management llc one of the nations most successful and daring hedge funds with  billion in assets and the founders fund a tiny but increasingly influential venture capital firm with a laserbeam focus on consumer internet startups latest news videos thiel garners attention not just for his business acumen and luxurious lifestyle but for his unorthodox belief that founders should get more of a stake and a say in their companies hence the name he gave his venture capital firm and its unusual location far from san franciscos financial district or silicon valleys sand hill road in spacious hightech headquarters in the presidio complex that houses george lucas movie empire we are basically trying to help the next generation of founders and entrepreneurs build awesome businesses said thiel a former corporate lawyer known as a quiet but determined competitor in the boardroom and on the chessboard we tend to like somewhat riskier more outofthebox companies that really have the potential to change the world thiel launched the founders fund in early  and recruited former paypal colleagues ken howery and luke nosek both  they shared his desire to create a venture firm run by former entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs now thiel has recruited sean parker one of silicon valleys more colorful personalities and a fellow startup philosopher to join his quartet of venture capitalists on the prowl for the next big investment parker  an early veteran of three highprofile startups  napster inc plaxo inc and facebook inc  convinced the founders fund to invest in facebook one of silicon valleys most promising social networking web sites parkers uncanny intuition for what people products and markets are likely to take off and his singular drive to empower entrepreneurs make him a significant asset for founders fund thiel said a new approach thiel is reexamining and might even be reinventing traditional venture capital paul saffo a tech industry forecaster who has tracked silicon valley for the past two decades said longstanding investors who once reigned supreme from their sand hill road pedestals are now getting squeezed by private equity firms on the high end and wealthy angel investors on the low end of the investing scale a bleak market for venturebacked initial public offerings has only increased the pressure we will see more changes to the venturecapital model in the next five years than we have seen in the last  saffo said peter is definitely tweaking the model he has the luxury and flexibility to play around a bit entrepreneurs trying their hand at the venture capital game is nothing new and it can be a winning combination for some you certainly pick up a lot of credibility as a venture capitalist if you have been an entrepreneur said mark heesen president of the national venture capital association so far the combination is working for the founders fund which raised its first  million fund in  and has invested in a dozen companies now it is on the verge of raising a second fund in the  million to  million ballpark while the first fund focused on raising money from likeminded entrepreneurs and investors this time thiel is casting a wider net to lure more institutional investors such as universities and endowments the breadandbutter of traditional venture firms the little guy dollar for dollar the founders fund is still a bit player in a soakingrich field but its close ties to gifted entrepreneurs and its founderfriendly approach have swung open doors with soughtafter silicon valley startups thats where thiel believes parker will give the founders fund another edge few better understand the challenges and pitfalls entrepreneurs face in the risky and sometimes ruthless world of silicon valley parker had a dramatic falling out with highprofile investors mike moritz of sequoia capital a marquee venture capital firm and ram shriram a google inc angel investor that led to parkers abrupt departure from the internet address book company plaxo parker says he was drawn to the opportunity to give entrepreneurs more control over their destiny we are all about creating an alignment between investors and entrepreneurs parker said entrepreneurs frequently complain about the imbalance of power with venture capitalists yet until now there wasnt much entrepreneurs could do about it without venture dollars they had little hope of transforming their lofty ideas into viable businesses but the technology boom of the s netted big returns for many entrepreneurs in silicon valley who are now turning around and investing their new wealth in budding ventures one entrepreneur won over by the founders funds philosophy is barney pell the yearold founder of powerset a naturallanguage searchengine startup that harbors ambitions of challenging google by analyzing the underlying meaning of search queries powerset hopes to produce more relevant results pell gained early support for this intriguing yet unproven idea from thiel a longtime friend and stanford university classmate when pell was raising a  million round of angel funding the founders fund quickly invested  founders fund then pumped more money into a  million venture round in october from the first board meeting it was clear that peter was putting all of his energy into thinking about how to help this company as much as possible pell said benefit to founders powerset also was the first company to sign up for a parker brainstorm inspired by his personal frustrations as a startup founder parker came up with a novel arrangement that he hopes will benefit other founders as they build their companies a new type of stock that allows founders to cash out a small percentage of their stake in a funding round so they dont have to wait until the company is sold or goes public pell who maxed out credit cards deferred salary and considered taking out a second mortgage until he could raise serious money and interest from the right investors says hes relieved that he and his fellow founders dont have to feel rushed to sell the company to get some return on their investment of energy time and money there is often a tension between venture capitalists and founders the venture capitalist wants the founders to starve and to have no cash liquidity until the very end of course the founders unlike the venture capitalists are putting all of their eggs in one basket pell said sean came up with the idea of allowing founders to sell small amounts of their shares along the way so you can have some lifechanging effects and reduce your risk and everyone can be aligned for a home run lesson learned parker says he learned a powerful lesson about the importance of taking time to build a business from observing the trajectories of some of the valleys most successful businesses what would have happened if the founders had sold those companies before finetuning them paypal started out as an encryption product that beamed money between mobile devices before hitting on the online payment business that it ultimately sold to ebay for  billion google didnt strike internet ore until the paid search market had time to fully develop largely because we were all founders ourselves were inherently more interested in helping new entrepreneurs develop into successful leaders than we are in getting rich parker said as someone who has started and run a few companies myself my primary interest is in helping creative people build companies and run those companies over the longterm i also happen to believe that this is the best way to create value for my limited partners and by extension for myself

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
