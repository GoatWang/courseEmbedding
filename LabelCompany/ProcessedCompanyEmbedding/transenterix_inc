stock to buy right now george budwell tmfgbudwell nov   at am medtronic nysemdt and transenterix inc nysemkttrxc both appear to be wellpositioned to benefit from an aging global population and longer life spans both of which should drive a sizable uptick in the demand for medical devices in the coming decades lets take a closer look at which company offers investors the better means of taking advantage of this demographic tailwind moving forward  image source getty images medtronic is a mature medical device company although a largecap dividend aristocrat stock like medtronic may sound like a boring pick compared to an upandcomer like transenterix there really is more than meets the eye with this top medical device company first off medtronic has a solid track record of posting modest singledigit revenue growth and doubledigit eps growth when excluding the impact of any nongaap adjustments moreover the companys headfirst foray into the mergers and acquisitions scene over the last six years has vastly broadened its global footprint commercial portfolio and overall scale transforming it into the worlds largest medical technology company this year medtronic has been working toward integrating these various acquisitions and streamlining its overall operations in order to improve profitability and increase its free cash flows going forward and if all goes as planned the company should have the ability to continue upping its quarterly dividend on a regular basis in the years to come as well as remain a leader in terms of innovation  image source medtronic beyond its already healthy and stillimproving fundamental picture medtronic also sports a diverse product portfolio consisting of implantable cardiac devices a range of diabetes care products and numerous other therapies that span the entire patient care continuum from diagnosis to recovery put simply medtronic isnt a onetrick pony which gives it a highly diversified revenue stream that can withstand the typical ebbs and flows of the global medical device market transenterix is a speculative bet on the redhot robotic surgery market transenterix is a smallcap robotic surgery company that offers tremendous upside potential  yet stomachwrenching levels of risk as well the companys story revolves around its two robotic surgery platforms senhance previously known as the alfx system that sports ce mark approval in the european union for minimally invasive surgery procedures and the developmentalstage surgibot system thats designed to go headtohead against intuitive surgicals marketleading da vinci surgical system the crux of the situation is that senhances commercialization in the eu remains in its nascent stages with the company selling its first unit in italy earlier this year and its entirely unclear when if ever the fda will clear the surgibot system for sale inside the united states transenterix has tried to remain upbeat about the state of surgibots regulatory dance with the fda but the company simply hasnt been able to say anything definitive since the devices k submission was pushed back for its failure to meet the criteria for substantial equivalence to another previously approved product earlier this year so with a dwindling cash pile that probably wont last past  the company appears ripe for a sizable secondary offering sometime soon perhaps more worrisome transenterixs core value proposition depends entirely on its ability to successfully navigate the fda regulatory maze to break into the multibilliondollar robotic surgery market  a task it has yet to achieve and thats before going headtohead against the established market leader which stock is the better buy in this match up medtronic is arguably a far better buy due to its stable cash flows impressive product portfolio and quarterly payout transenterix after all has yet to even break into the allimportant us market and its ultimate game plan is to take on the pound gorilla that is intuitive surgical once its does so thats a tall order for a smallcap company with extremely limited resources  even if surgibot truly is a superior product to intuitives da vinci surgical system

fool answers contact us login search search how risky is transenterix inc find out if the first sale of its only marketable product makes this troubled roboticsurgery stock a buy cory renauer tmfangapples aug   at pm image source getty images its been a wild year for roboticsurgery stock transenterix inc nysemkttrxc last september the company spent a great deal acquiring the alfx system while waiting for the us food and drug administration to make a decision regarding its main project at the time the surgibot system the purchase raised some eyebrows but without it transenterix would have nothing to sell right now in april the fda declared the surgibot not equivalent to existing devices and refused to grant it clearance the alfx earned eu marketing approval known as the ce mark long before transenterix bought it and just ahead of reporting secondquarter earnings the company announced its first sale does the sale signal a smooth path to profitability or is transenterix as risky as ever read on to find out bleak beginnings the alfx earned eu marketing approval in  but its previous owner italys sofar never sold one to be fair sofar mainly markets pharmaceutical products and dietary supplements with a minor medicaldevice presence theres a chance its launch failed because of a lack of effort on sofars part but success under transenterixs ownership is hardly a sure thing image source transenterix inc there are reasons to suspect ramping up demand for alfx in the eu will be more difficult than expected the company is up against firmly entrenched roboticsurgery pioneer intuitive surgical nasdaqisrg and its da vinci line of devices that sell for around  million each with newer models as much as  million the alfx costs roughly  million but promises lower perprocedure costs than da vinci systems by allowing surgeons to reuse instruments according to transenterix ceo todd pope intuitive surgical has been peddling older refurbished devices at steep discounts diminishing alfxs ability to compete on price whether hospitals arent interested in the alfx or are simply being won over by intuitive surgical strategy isnt clear but its probably a combination of both what we do know is that transenterix began its alfx selling efforts in the fourth quarter of  but didnt announce the first sale until late last month that might not be as bad as it sounds as management expects hospitals to spend four to six quarters with the device on site before pulling the trigger implying an unspecified trial period allowed prior to official purchase that means its still too early to issue alfx a european death certificate the device isnt cleared for marketing in the us although the company intends to file an application for k clearance by the end of the year if approved us sales could begin in  but that clearance is far from guaranteed in the numbers the most encouraging tidbit from the secondquarter earnings call was a steep increase in hospital interest in the first quarter management said surgeons representing  hospitals had participated in a handson demonstration during the second quarter surgeons from  hospitals gave the alfx a test drive however management didnt say how many of those demos resulted in hospital placements that could eventually lead to sales a far less encouraging figure to point to in the second quarter was an enormous writedown of about  million in goodwill associated with the surgibot systems implosion overall transenterix reported a staggering loss of  million during the three months ended in june goodwill impairment is a noncash charge allowing transenterix to exit the quarter with  million in cash and equivalents which should be enough to see it through the third quarter of next year despite its decent cash position though i expect that more share dilution lies ahead for investors even if all  hospitals to test drive an alfx this year end up buying one it wouldnt cover the amount of cash operations are expected to burn through over the next year or so with rd teams on two continents trxc data by ycharts if the stock is hovering near its recent price of  around this time next year investors can expect their slice of any potential profits to evaporate again of course theres a chance the fda might clear the alfx before then and positive european sales figures could come rolling in that news would almost certainly drive up the stock price and limit the number of shares the company will need to sell to keep its doors open considering transenterixs track record though i wouldnt recommend betting on such success to the most adventurous investors its far too risky cory renauer has no position in any stocks mentioned you can follow cory on twitter tmfangapples or connect with
