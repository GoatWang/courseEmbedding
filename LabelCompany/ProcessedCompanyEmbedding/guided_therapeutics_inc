luviva value propositions news contact us careers about us early detection better outcomes guided therapeutics inc has developed a platform technology for the early detection of disease that leads to cancer based on our patented biophotonic technology the products use light to detect disease at the cellular level and provide painless and immediate results at the time of the examination testing for cancer today usually involves a taking a tissue sample like a biopsy and sending it out to a specialist at a laboratory for results patients worry while waiting on test results and in many instances are given the wrong diagnosis – in most cases a falsepositive result a false positive diagnosis means the patient will undergo more testing only to discover later that they are healthy our technology noninvasively scans the suspicious tissue with cool white light providing results that studies have shown can detect precancer up to two years earlier than the tissuesample method and with fewer falsepositive results this means less pain no time waiting for results and fewer unnecessary treatments luviva® advanced cervical scan luviva has distribution in  countries with us fda review underway our first noninvasive cancer detection product is the luviva® advanced cervical scan luviva is in use in canada latin america europe asia and africa and is under premarket application pma review by the us food and drug administration luviva is designed to determine the true likelihood of treatable cervical disease that may lead to cancer in women aged  years and over who have been screened for cervical cancer and have an abnormal result about  or more women with an abnormal result at this point in the testing process will eventually be diagnosed as having a false positive result – but after having an unnecessary colposcopy and biopsy a oneminute scan with luviva can rule out about  of the falsepositive cases immediately without the need for colposcopy and biopsy luviva has also been shown in clinical trials to identify disease up to two years earlier than colposcopy and biopsy luviva has also shown promise as a potential screening tool in the developing world to be used where the pap test or hpv test are not widely available  a clinical trial is underway to expand luviva’s capabilities as a noninvasive cervical cancer screening product cervical cancer is a big global problem after breast cancer cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women’s health it is a leading cause of cancer deaths in the developing world for women of childbearing age incidence of cervical cancer worldwide  cases of invasive cancer   deaths  in the us  cases of precancer  cases of cancer annually   women will die from cervical cancer   million pap tests annually  million followup referrals screening and diagnosis are effective but costly in developed regions of the world  common screening methods that lead to additional testing are positive for human papillomavirus hpv or an abnormal pap test cytology in developing regions where screening methods are less commonly available there is a different story “in subsaharan africa  new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed per   women annually and  per   women die from the disease these figures compare with  and  per   women respectively in north america the drastic differences can be explained by lack of access to effective screening and to services that facilitate early detection and treatment” world health organization report improving cervical cancer detection with luviva testing for cervical cancer today in the developed world involves taking a tissue sample – like a pap test cytology for screening or a biopsy for diagnosis and sending the samples to a laboratory where they are read by a medical specialist results can take several days or weeks delaying treatment and creating a time of uncertainty for the patient and her family in the developing world it’s a different story screening programs may be limited to a portion of the population in the larger cities with almost no screening is the rural areas luviva can improve care in both situations in the developed world up to  or more of colposcopies and biopsies for for women who have abnormal pap tests are found later to be normal or not necessary  if hpv is used for screening those rates could go up unmet clinical need for luviva  a noninvasive “triage” product to determine which patients that screen positive with paphpv need a biopsy true positives and which don’t normal or false positive in the developing world cervical cancer remains a leading cause of cancer death for women of childbearing age due to the lack of laboratory infrastructure unmet clinical need for luviva  a noninvasive “screening” product that provides an immediate result in countries with little paphpv screening other cancers the platform technology that is luviva can be applied to other forms or carcinoma we’ve conducted human testing with the technology on patients at risk for esophageal cancer with promising results  while a great deal more testing and development work needs to be done on that product we believe that there is a need for our technology in the esophageal market other cancers in addition to cervical and esophageal where the technology can be applied head and neck cancer anal cancer colorectal cancer skin cancer our business model our business model is based on sales of a device in this case the luviva® advanced cervical scan and a singleuse disposable patient interface called the cervical guide  the continuing revenue from the cervical guides provides value for our shareholders the cervical guide provides calibration of the luviva before each test and assures the patient of a

therapeutics to develop esophageal cancer product acquires intellectual property rights from  aol finance guided therapeutics to develop esophageal cancer product acquires intellectual property rights from share business wirevia the motley fool aolcom feb th  am guided therapeutics to develop esophageal cancer product acquires intellectual property rights from konica minoltanorcross gabusiness wire guided therapeutics inc otcbb gthp otcqb gthp today announced it has acquired worldwide rights to develop a noninvasive esophageal cancer detection product from konica minolta the product will be based on guided therapeutics patented biophotonic technology platformunder terms of the agreement guided therapeutics acquired both the rights it had licensed to konica minolta and the rights to certain intellectual property invented by konica minolta upon fda approval konica minolta would receive a royalty for its licensed intellectual property if used in the final product in addition guided therapeutics will now have full worldwide sales and marketing rights as opposed to a royalty only as was anticipated under the previous arrangementkonica minolta has been an excellent partner in helping us to jump start the development of this promising early cancer detection technology by contributing significant resources directly to guided therapeutics in the form of nondilutive funding said mark l faupel phd ceo and president of guided therapeutics the potential market for this product is significant and we believe that the best way to maximize shareholder value is to complete product development independently using the two companies combined intellectual property at the same time we also reserve the option to partner with a new more healthcarefocused companygoing forward guided therapeutics will be responsible for the clinical regulatory and product development process devices and other resources to be used for clinical trials which could begin later this year are already at or near completion in order to complete development of the product the company has made progress toward securing additional funding which could come either from a new potential partner or other sourceshaving access to the intellectual property necessary for commercializing the product especially at this latter stage of its development optimizes shareholder value in our platform technology said dr faupel the recent good news from fda that our esophageal cancer detection product is a nonsignificant risk and does not require an investigational device exemption also supports this value propositionaccording to the world health organization esophageal cancer ranks just below cervical cancer in newly diagnosed cases new cases of esophageal cancer are estimated at  worldwide

about us early detection better outcomes guided therapeutics inc has developed a platform technology for the early detection of disease that leads to cancer based on our patented biophotonic technology the products use light to detect disease at the cellular level and provide painless and immediate results at the time of the examination testing for cancer today usually involves a taking a tissue sample like a biopsy and sending it out to a specialist at a laboratory for results patients worry while waiting on test results and in many instances are given the wrong diagnosis – in most cases a falsepositive result a false positive diagnosis means the patient will undergo more testing only to discover later that they are healthy our technology noninvasively scans the suspicious tissue with cool white light providing results that studies have shown can detect precancer up to two years earlier than the tissuesample method and with fewer falsepositive results this means less pain no time waiting for results and fewer unnecessary treatments luviva® advanced cervical scan luviva has distribution in  countries with us fda review underway our first noninvasive cancer detection product is the luviva® advanced cervical scan luviva is in use in canada latin america europe asia and africa and is under premarket application pma review by the us food and drug administration luviva is designed to determine the true likelihood of treatable cervical disease that may lead to cancer in women aged  years and over who have been screened for cervical cancer and have an abnormal result about  or more women with an abnormal result at this point in the testing process will eventually be diagnosed as having a false positive result – but after having an unnecessary colposcopy and biopsy a oneminute scan with luviva can rule out about  of the falsepositive cases immediately without the need for colposcopy and biopsy luviva has also been shown in clinical trials to identify disease up to two years earlier than colposcopy and biopsy luviva has also shown promise as a potential screening tool in the developing world to be used where the pap test or hpv test are not widely available  a clinical trial is underway to expand luviva’s capabilities as a noninvasive cervical cancer screening product cervical cancer is a big global problem after breast cancer cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women’s health it is a leading cause of cancer deaths in the developing world for women of childbearing age incidence of cervical cancer worldwide  cases of invasive cancer   deaths  in the us  cases of precancer  cases of cancer annually   women will die from cervical cancer   million pap tests annually  million followup referrals screening and diagnosis are effective but costly in developed regions of the world  common screening methods that lead to additional testing are positive for human papillomavirus hpv or an abnormal pap test cytology in developing regions where screening methods are less commonly available there is a different story “in subsaharan africa  new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed per   women annually and  per   women die from the disease these figures compare with  and  per   women respectively in north america the drastic differences can be explained by lack of access to effective screening and to services that facilitate early detection and treatment” world health organization report improving cervical cancer detection with luviva testing for cervical cancer today in the developed world involves taking a tissue sample – like a pap test cytology for screening or a biopsy for diagnosis and sending the samples to a laboratory where they are read by a medical specialist results can take several days or weeks delaying treatment and creating a time of uncertainty for the patient and her family in the developing world it’s a different story screening programs may be limited to a portion of the population in the larger cities with almost no screening is the rural areas luviva can improve care in both situations in the developed world up to  or more of colposcopies and biopsies for for women who have abnormal pap tests are found later to be normal or not necessary  if hpv is used for screening those rates could go up unmet clinical need for luviva  a noninvasive “triage” product to determine which patients that screen positive with paphpv need a biopsy true positives and which don’t normal or false positive in the developing world cervical cancer remains a leading cause of cancer death for women of childbearing age due to the lack of laboratory infrastructure unmet clinical need for luviva  a noninvasive “screening” product that provides an immediate result in countries with little paphpv screening other cancers the platform technology that is luviva can be applied to other forms or carcinoma we’ve conducted human testing with the technology on patients at risk for esophageal cancer with promising results  while a great deal more testing and development work needs to be done on that product we believe that there is a need for our technology in the esophageal market other cancers in addition to cervical and esophageal where the technology can be applied head and neck cancer anal cancer colorectal cancer skin cancer our business model our business model is based on sales of a device in this case the luviva® advanced cervical scan and a singleuse disposable patient interface called the cervical guide  the continuing revenue from the cervical guides provides value for our shareholders the cervical guide provides calibration of the luviva before each test and assures the patient of a
