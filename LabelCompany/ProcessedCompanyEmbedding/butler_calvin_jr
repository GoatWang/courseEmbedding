il probably as cynthia hamilton calvins estate was probated between  and  fayette il he died intestate son aaron g was appointed administrator of estate he died at home on  may  near ramsey fayette il at age  calvins middle name sometimes given as john but there was never proof of this it is more likely that it is jones and that calvin j butler is named after drgen calvin jones of nc and tn also see atlas j butler file atlas jones was a brother of drgen calvin jones and a number of boys with nc connections are named after these two jones brothers there are several instances where there was both a calvin and an atlas in the same family and often both had the middle name of jones  note that calvin j butler had a relative named atlas j butler calvin j butler named his youngest son atlas jones butler and that son named a son calvin jones butler  also despite published statements to the contrary he was never known as john calvin butler j c butler or j butler  the transposition of his first and middle names or his initials has no basis in known public or family records and was simply a guess by researcher allen pendergraft one or two wives prior to martha hicks are sometimes reported but these earlier marriages have no basis in fact and not included here although they have unfortunately found their way into published works and internet files these additional marriages were also guesses by allen pendergraft based on  an erroneous interpretation of the  census of carroll co tn william j butler and his new bride susan crow were enumerated in the household of calvin butler in  but neither william j nor susan were children of calvin butler as pendergraft supposed and  the middle names of some of calvins children supposed by pendergraft to be surnames of earlier wives  although martha j hicks married calvin j butler at an unusually young age the fact is that marthas mother was widowed with several young daughters and no known sons and i believe that early marriage of all her daughters was condoned if not encouraged for additional discussion of these points click here most of the dates for calvin and his family apparently came from the bible of his daughter malinda now lost his birth year is shown as  as is usually seen in family records some sources give the birth year as  or  but these earlier dates are thought to be errors conveniently made to allow for supposed earlier but nonexistent marriages in the censuses of   and  his age is given as   and  resp so perhaps he was b late  rather than  he was a farmer  the location of some of his land in carroll co tn can be determined from deeds in carroll co tn and the following information in  isaac williams owned land in th dist carroll co tn adj calvin butler described as follows beginning at an elm in william taylors line then east with calvin butler line to indian creek then down said creek to the mouth of bush branch then up said branch to the beginning  a more or less

pruett  male prob son of calvins second wife cynthia donaldson and her first husband james w pruett the siblings if any and parents of calvin j butler are unknown at this time despite any published material to the contrary  i am aware of the book the descendants of thomas pincerna by judge e butler the notes of allen pendergraft and robert allen in the huntingdon tn genealogical library and various other sources  all of which list various sets of parents for calvin without any substantiating proof  family letters autograph books and inscriptions on photographs state that the children of calvin j butler were cousins of the children of seymour spencer butler atlas j butler and marvel butler the latter three were brothers and sons of james butler and susannah spencer  the exact

butlers wifes cousin louisa mccaslin homer butlers mother   she and nancy leanna hicks were cousins per malindas obituary this cousin relationship could result in a number of different ways  through malindas mother martha hicks whose father elijah hicks was the brother of claiborne hicks the grandfather of leanna hicks cole making them nd cousins or  through lurena butler wife of claiborne hicks who could be related to malindas father calvin butler no proof of this   she and gholston ward butler son of marvel butler were cousins when gwb lived in carroll tn he signed malindas autograph book

acquired this land or what became of it he and clark seymore butler were cousins per  mar  ltr from csb to agb notes on the possible source of his middle name greenberry   a son by the name of green butler is attributed to thomas e butler by robert allen who says that green butler d ca   if this green butlers middle name was berry or green was short for greenberry then it could provide a reason for why aaron greenberry butler born the year following the death of green butler came by his middle name  thomas e butler and basil and elizabeth billingsley administered the estate of green butler carroll county minutes of the court feb   green butlers widow was named as zetha possibly zetha province but no mar record available under guardianship of james and andrew province and thomas hamilton no children mentioned   and  census data for thomas e butler supports a son b betw  and  but not earlier than approx  this would require green to have mar zetha at age  and then d immediately if the census is wrong then based on thomas e butlers birthyear of  green could have been born a few years earlier than  but probably not earlier than   more data is required to determine the relationship between thomas e and green butler   the given name greenberry or simply green is common in the american south often men named green had the middle name berry or green was short for greenberry   in particular note a green berry spencer  several butlers appear to have been named aftergiven names from the spencer family seymore and clark are other examples of spencer names used later by butler families thought to be relations   the given name may be taken from the surname greenberry specifically col nicholas greenberrybury who was keeper of the great seal and judge of the high court of chancery in england he came to america on the ship constant friendship in  and had at least one son and three daughters one daughter katherine married col henry ridgely son of col henry ridgely of

borrowed to buy the land and equipment would easily be paid back in a year or two this was not the case the market for alfalfa was not as it was represented to be and oren lost the land equipment and most of his money the family always believed that they had been fleeced by shady developers it was probably about  when oren relocated to dinuba tulare co ca the reason dinuba was chosen may have been because a cousin william franklin mccaslin was already living there between  and  he worked at a cigar and tobacco store in addition to farming  his home burned  nov  the fire having been caused by an oil heater the family lost almost all their possessions in the fire but oren saved his motherinlaw mary jane blackburn harvey who had fallen in the burning home while trying to retrieve a feather bed
