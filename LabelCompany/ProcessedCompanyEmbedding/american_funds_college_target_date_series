postretirement withdrawal horizon the target date funds are not designed for a lumpsum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income the key difference between the retirement funds and the target funds is the overall allocation to equity although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date the retirement funds
