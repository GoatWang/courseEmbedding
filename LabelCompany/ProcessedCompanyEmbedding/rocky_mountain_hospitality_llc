hospitality grows through value acquisitions rocky mountain concern saw opportunity during downturn mike mclean april th  staff photo by mike mclean cinthia and steve rice owners of rocky mountain hospitality llc now operate eight hotels in idaho and montana that employ a total of  people rocky mountain hospitality llc a post fallsbased hotel operator with eight properties in idaho and montana has grown steadily since buying a modest hotel in coeur dalene and moving its base to north idaho in  at that time it had two propertiestoday rocky mountain hospitality operates six guesthouse hotel franchises three in north idaho one in lewiston one in idaho falls and one in missoula mont it also operates a super  hotel in moscow idaho and an independent hotel in northwestern montanaalmost all are turnaround properties says steve rice who owns the company with his wife cinthia the goal is to renovate reposition and reflag rice saysrocky mountain hospitality employs  people and likely will hire another  or so this summer he saysrice says the hendersonville tennbased guesthouse international hotel chain is franchisee friendly serves rocky mountain hospitalitys target market and has lower fees than other franchise operationsour mission is to offer the greatest value in our market rice say adding that doesnt mean we have the lowest rate but no others give more for the same rateone key to rocky mountain hospitalitys growth he asserts is in keeping its debttorevenue ratio lower than its competition rice says the company usually funds down payments for new acquisitions through retained earnings so its not strapped with debtthat helped us in the downturn he says by focusing on modest properties with around  beds rocky mountain doesnt have to compete with many big investors he addsin the years leading to the recession hotel property prices escalated and rocky mountain didnt acquire new properties that turned out to our benefit rice sayswhen the recession hit prices and revenues crashed he says some competing properties that had changed hands at the top of the market couldnt stay afloat during that time rocky mountain bought the lodge at lolo hot springs near lolo mont the companys only independent property rocky mountain then bought a hotel in kellogg idaho out of bankruptcy in its most recent acquisition last july rocky mountain bought a hotel in missoula where it qualified for a small business administration loan program we probably couldnt have acquired it without the sba loan rice saysduring the downturn rocky mountain properties captured some new customers who stepped down to value hotels like guesthouse from more expensive hotels rice says that was offset however by the loss of the construction market and a general decline in both leisure and business travelvalue properties werent hit as hard as others though he says we were down less than the general market still profitable and still acquiring propertieswhile average daily occupancy rates were down net income grew companywide because of the acquisitions rice saysour average daily rate has improved over the last  months but its not where it was in  and our expenses have increased he says we made adjustments based on the downturn being the new status quorocky mountain is looking for additional potential acquisitions and montana might be the next growth area for the companyi would like to look at the next market he says now that were in missoula maybe well look at butte and helenaguesthouse international might be a small player in the hospitality industry considering that only some  hotels are under its brand and rocky mountain is its largest franchisee but the internet has been the great equalizer in the markets they serve rice says there are no tv ads for guesthouse its all about destination and  to  percent of travelers use the internet to make their plans he says if you pull up sandpoint on the internet guesthouse is going to be right up there with best westernthe rices run the company out of a squarefoot office attached to their home near the spokane river in post fallsits not hard to go to work rice says its harder to get away from work the challenge is to shut the doorfor that reason the office has its own separate entrance that isnt visible from the living area of the housewe dont walk through the house to get to the office he saysthe company started with an investment in a single hotel property in pocatello idaho  years ago at the beginning the couple kept their day jobssteve was general manager at an upscale hotel property and cinthia was in marketingwe ran the first hotel almost a year with separate jobs cinthia rice says they then decided to transition the hotel ownership from an investment to a careerit was a huge leap of faith she saysas they had children they decided their longterm plan would be to buy more hotels and hire general managers to run them that way they could grow rocky mountain hospitality while devoting more time to their two boys rather than spend  to  hours each running a single hotelwith two boys under  years old they faced the decision of where to raise a family coeur dalene one of their favorite vacation spots was high on their list so when the hotel at  w appleway hit the market they sold the pocatello property and moved to north idahowe decided to come up and expand up here she says mike mclean
