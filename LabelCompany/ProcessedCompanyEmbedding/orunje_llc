for a healthy summer pardeep athwal md mba july   a puff of truth about smoking rushim bains md july   daily preventative medicine rajbeer singh sangha md june   cup ojoy  i mean joe pardeep athwal md mba june   the stomach flu   rushim bains md june   a simple cure   rajbeer singh sangha md get the wheels turning for a healthy summer by pardeep athwal md mba exercising can at times feel like a daunting chore in the midst of work soccer practice dinner and weekend obligations how does one find time to keep physically fit this was the question i asked myself a few months ago and soon after i stumbled into a local area bike shop after a few test rides and questions by the knowledgeable staff i was the proud owner of a shiny new hybrid unbeknown to me at the time this purchase would change my summer in more ways than i could imagine all without sacrificing a significant amount of time here are a few of the positives of partaking in what i like to call enjoyable exercise rediscover your city i used to drive everywhere even places that were a few miles away once i received my bike i decided to cycle to these places and quickly learned that the city i live in began coming alive buildings parks and gardens were now significantly more noticeable to me instead of driving past them quickly in my car i was now marveling at the intricate designs on these centuries old buildings the beautiful blossoms of flowers and people strolling down the sidewalks whether your walking running or biking you will be able to get outdoors bathe your skin with a healthy dose of vitamin d and cause increased release of feel good neurotransmitters this has an immensely positive impact on your overall wellbeing and mood so hop on a bike or your feet to take advantage of a variety of health benefits while seeing your city in an entirely new way doing things you normally do anyways with the added benefit of burning calories and boosting energy my commute to work is a minute drive mostly because i hit several traffic lights on the way i decided one day to bike to work something i had never done before i added  minutes to my commute which was now  minutes however it was far more enjoyable and less stressful than driving also my roundtrip commute allotted me  minutes of exercise without interfering with my normal schedule a mild to moderate paced bike ride burns  calories per hour and a light jogbrisk walk burns the same amount of calories in about  minutes in addition to burning calories moderate exercise increases energy levels which studies show equate to increased productivity at work particularly in the mornings how does this happen physical activity increases oxygen and nutrient delivery to your tissues and helps your body pump blood more efficiently which bathes your tissues with much needed energy packed nutrients and molecules this has a direct positive impact on energy levels so if your work commute is short instead of driving to work hop on a bike or put on your sneakers and take a brisk walk which will give you jolt of energy while burning calories and making your morning commute far more enjoyable relieve stress get fit and ward of chronic illnesses decades of research has time and time again demonstrated the benefits of exercise from weight control to decreased incidence of chronic health conditions moderate daily exercise goes a long way in helping you live a long and healthy life in particular regular exercise boosts highdensity lipoprotein hdl which is what we doctors refer to as good cholesterol this significantly decreases your risk of cardiovascular disease and helps to reduce stroke type  diabetes and certain types of cancer now let me ask you a question do you ever get into work in the morning and notice your mood isnt the best well let me be the first to tell you that exercise stimulates neurotransmitter release as mentioned above which helps you to feel happier and more relaxed your morning slump may become a thing of the past and furthermore your confidence and selfesteem will improve as you feel better about your physical appearance lastly all of this can be done while increasing time you spend with your nature or your family so whether youre walking jogging or riding your bike with a family of  get up get out and advantage of time in the outdoors to sum it all up i hope sharing my personal experience with you helped to shed light on how a small purchase significantly impacted my overall wellbeing and mood we all feel at times that there are not enough hours in the day to accomplish the important tasks we have set out to do let alone spend an hour in the gym cycling in place or running on a treadmill incorporating exercise into your daily schedule will allow you to get the muchneeded physical activity without cutting into your busy life and as research shows moderate exercise  minutes or more can significantly impact your energy levels mood and overall health in countless ways lastly here are some of our favorite walkingjogging and biking trails around chicago so stop looking for excuses get up get out and get going and make the world your playground references the benefits of physical

among collegiate athletes versus nonathletes journal of american college health  rosenkilde m american journal of physiology aug   news release university of copenhagen a puff of truth about smoking by rushim bains md walking around chicago i still see a lot of people smoking we have had clean air laws on the books for years now but the reality is that people are still hooked on this habit it may or may not be the case that people are aware just how harmful this habit truly is but its time to shed some light on the effect smoking has on our health most people know that smoking is bad for you and causes lung cancer but there has been decades of data and studies that show a lot more than just that smoking is actually the leading preventable cause of mortality leading to  million deaths worldwide and  deaths in the us alone per year a study in norway showed that for people who smoke more than  cigarettes per day years of life lost were  years in women and  years in men smoking is also implicated in  of all cardiovascular deaths in the united states think about that  of all heart related deaths in the us are attributable to this preventable habit smoking is also strongly correlated with many other conditions such as copd emphysema tuberculosis various forms of pneumonia influenza and the common cold the number of cigarettes smoked daily has also been linked to an increased risk of developing diabetes in the long term smoking also accelerates bone loss leading to osteoporosis and the increased risk of hip fracture in women it is also linked to complications during pregnancy premature menopause erectile dysfunction in men and infertility in both sexes other conditions linked with smoking include ulcers of the stomach periodontal disease and gingivitis so you may ask what about cancer well everybody knows smoking is one of the major causes of lung cancer but we have discovered that many more cancers are strongly linked with smoking those include but arent limited to colorectal head and neck kidney liver pancreatic penis stomach cervical breast and nasal cancers leukemia a blood cancer and another type of lung cancer called mesothelioma are linked with smoking as well ever see those commercials from lawyers advertising whether you developed mesothelioma from working with asbestos or at a ship yard well just remember smoking is still a more common cause of that disease than any other factor is the damage already done if weve spent years smoking yes but there is good news smoking cessation is very beneficial studies show mortality benefits of quitting smoking at all ages but the benefits are even greater for those who quit before the age of  quitting smoking also reduces the risk of developing cancer and the accelerated decline of lung function that causes copd but you have to quit smoking completely as studies so far have failed to show that only partial reductions in smoking lead to mortality benefits so if youre down to half a pack a day then kudos to you but you really need to kick the habit entirely if you want the health benefits what about these new ecigarettes are they better than regular cigarettes this is a difficult question to answer because ecigarettes are relatively new and not enough research and data is available to quantify their longterm effects the paucity of evidence however does suggest that they may be somewhat safer since they are smokeless and it is cigarette smoke that causes the majority of damage to the lungs but before you embrace this new trend its important to understand that these do still contain nicotine the addictive drug that is found in all cigarettes and it is nicotine that is related to some of the harmful effects of smoking and withdrawal symptoms so if you are using these new devices or are considering the switch remember not to utilize these excessively and keep a close eye on new research and news stories discussing the effects of ecigarettes on your health what about the side effects of quitting smoking sure there are withdrawal symptoms from nicotine such as increased appetite depressed mood irritability anxiety and problems with concentration also people who quit smoking generally gain weight of roughly  to  kg over time people with a history of depression who quit smoking are more likely to trigger a depressive episode yet despite this the health benefits of quitting smoking far outweigh these factors so put out that cigarette and breathe some fresh air before you do too much damage to your body and you dont have to do this cold

oral hygiene we shower on a daily basis we do multiple basic tasks that help maintain our bodies however it is always surprising to me how few people who have hypertension diabetes or other common chronic medical conditions engage in daily preventative medicine what does daily preventative medicine mean it means to monitor closely the parameters of your condition that may indicate it is being poorly controlled having a blood pressure monitor recording your diabetic fingersticks in a notebook and presenting it to a physician gives them a wealth of information that could not be otherwise found from all the eloquent and intricate testing we do when we get a blood pressure or a reading of your glucose from blood work we are only exposed to a snapshot of how the body may be doing with a long term trend we can make a much more accurate assessment of the condition how can this information translate into better health all your medications diet modifications and exercise can be tweaked with this information and especially medications can be titrated to better improve your longterm control of this condition recording your daily health habits does not only extend to your chronic medical conditions but can also be extended to your recording your daily food habits or the amount of steps you walk in a day having information of your normal function can also help a physician ascertain the degree of decompensation you may be suffering from a particular condition why is this important well aside from your own well being there is also an economic benefit studies have shown that a one percent reduction in weight blood pressure glucose and cholesterol risk factors would save  to  annually in medical costs per person while this information is valuable to a physician it should never be used by a patient to change their own medications and the results should always be discussed with your doctor this allows for the best improvements in your day to day diet medications and exercise regimen a recent study by kaiser permanentes center for health research showed that the simple act of keeping a food diary can double a persons weight loss furthermore researchers from this study noted that the task of keeping a daily journal does not need to be formal rather utilizing a pen and paper you can keep a record of the day to day progress you have made the process of reflection not only helps us become aware of our habits but also leads to motivation in keeping up with the trend the benefits of tightly controlling chronic medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes are numerous and include the prevention of renal failure chronic heart disease significant reduction in stroke risk and even decreased probability of developing erectile dysfunction the possibility of developing such conditions should give any with these diseases a moment of pause if they are not actively monitoring their condition multiple times a week never underestimate the smallest measures as they cumulatively often lead to the greatest of difference lastly we understand that some of you may be too busy to write down and track every little thing utilize some of these

medicine  august cup ojoy  i mean joe by pardeep athwal md mba for several decades caffeine got a bad rap primarily from a small subset of research articles published in the s and s as a child my mom would frequently tell me not to drink tea or coffee because it may stunt my growth and on more than one occasion ive heard a patient tell me they do no drugs not even coffee let me be the first to tell you incase you havent heard that new research suggests coffee is actually beneficial to your health in several ways you can finally breathe a sigh of relief after taking a sip of your piping hot caffeinated cup of joy that you are likely doing far more good than harm if any a study of over  adults spanning  years demonstrated that even heavy coffee drinkers ounces of coffee a day demonstrated no increased risk of mortality and there was even some indication that these regular coffee drinkers had a lower rate of mortality than noncoffee drinkers furthermore coffee has been linked to lower rates of type diabetes protection against some cancers parkinsons disease and depression so this all sounds great but what is it in coffee that is so beneficial its a mix of several components that give coffee its seemingly super powers coffee is chalk full of antioxidants which scour the body and neutralize potentially damaging things called free radicals free radicals can damage your cells and dna which overtime can lead to a multitude of illnesses and cancers caffeine works in the brain by blocking inhibitory neurotransmitters adenosine which increases the electrical activity in your brain improving mood reaction time memory and cognitive function lastly caffeine increases your metabolism and increases the breakdown of fat in your body which is beneficial for your wellbeing and physical appearance this all sounds great but this all sounds too good to be true as we have learned through our many personal experiences in life moderation is key coffee on its own is nearly calorie free and has  grams of fat and sugar however not many people enjoy coffee without any condiments and not to mention the lattes and other flavored beverages served up at our favorite coffee shops the fat and sugar can quickly begin to add up and the negative effects can overtake the health benefits in summary coffee is finally beginning to get the positive attention it deserves with an array of potential health benefits remember to keep moderation and limit what you add to your beverage lastly we toast your cup of coffee as a healthy start to  and remind you to put the toilet seat down if youre one of

risks nutrition bulletin    a simple cure by rajbeer singh sangha md the world of healthcare is rapidly evolving with new advances changing the landscape of medicine many patients query me during their visitations as to how they can become healthier in light of these advancements and discoveries such questions always cause me to pause and smile as they always get the same response strong viable health comes from within a rather cliched statement but one they dont expect to hear from a physician and one that causes a momentary puzzled look this statement simply alludes to the fact that most of medicine works to stabilize and give each individual the opportunity to pursue wholeself health the term applies to a lifestyle of healthy diet and daily exercise a recipe which the american heart association also lists as a key ingredient to improving your overall wellbeing the american heart association goes one step further and gives each individual dietary recommendations that reduce the risk of alzheimers ischemic stroke and improves cardiovascular health this diet recommendation has been analyzed and is supported by peer reviewed journals as per the american heart association current diet recommendations in the broadest sense are based on the mediterranean diet the key components include eating a diet primarily of plant based foods includingfruits and vegetables whole grains legumes and nuts replacement of butter with healthy fats such as olive oil using herbs and spices to flavor food and decreasing the amount of salt limiting red meat to no more than a few times a month while eating fish and poultry to at least two times a week further details can be found at the american heart seems rather simplistic and straight forward doesnt it yet this simple diet once adopted can improve blood pressure lower cholesterol decrease oxidant stress decrease risks of accelerated coronary artery disease and improve overall well being in terms of exercise the recommendations from the american heart association include aha recommendation for overall cardiovascular health at least  minutes of moderateintensity aerobic activity at least  days per week for a total of  minutes or at least  minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least  days per week for a total of  minutes or a combination of moderate and vigorousintensity aerobic activity and moderate to highintensity musclestrengthening activity at least  days per week for additional health benefits for lowering blood pressure and cholesterol an average  minutes of moderate to vigorousintensity aerobic activity  or  times per week once again this information is taken directly from the american heart associations website wwwheartorg which can be accessed for further reference with the combination of a healthy diet and consistent exercise regimen individuals will find significant improvements in their health and overall wellbeing even with medical advancements and the wide array of medications we have our disposal in  simple diet and exercise modifications prove to be superior in preventing many illnesses and helping promote a long active and happy life references willett wc

stomach flu by rushim bains md what is the stomach flu unlike the name it has nothing to do with the actual flu or influenza that infects the respiratory system the stomach flu or viral gastroenteritis is a virus infecting our gastrointestinal tract the most common cause of this disease is a virus called norovirus with rotavirus being the second most common this disease peaks in the winter and spring seasons if youve ever had this illness you know the symptoms diarrhea fever belly pain and vomiting although not all of these symptoms have to occur for you to have the disease symptoms tend to last less than two weeks and vomiting tends to precede the diarrhea among people who present to the emergency room with this illness the most common symptoms in descending order are nausea diarrhea and vomiting from the time you are infected until you start having symptoms varies but averages at  to  hours rotavirus tends to last longer than norovirus if you are having bloody stools diarrhea that lasts over a week with a recent history of travel or were recently prescribed antibiotics you may actually have another illness and should seek help from a medical professional food poisoning tends to occur more quickly than stomach flu with symptoms starting within  to  hours of consuming the infected food how do you deal with this illness the good news is around  of the time it is self limited and will go away on its own in  of cases you may have some prolonged symptoms after the illness is resolved requiring a temporary change in your dietary habits during the active illness it is recommended that adults consume sports drinks and broths in addition to water this is to help maintain your bodys electrolyte levels despite common practice avoid soft drinks and juices that are high in sugar content as they can worsen your symptoms also avoid dairy as many people develop temporary lactose intolerance while they are ill you are allowed to eat whatever you can tolerate but most people tend to do well with crackers yogurt soups and broiled starches such as potatoes noodles and rice there has been a lot of talk about probiotics but as of yet there isnt enough evidence to conclude that they help with the stomach flu for severe diarrhea adults under  can take over the counter loperamide which is an antidiarrheal drug this medicine should be avoided if you develop constipation a distended belly or worsening belly pain it should also be avoided if you have bloody stools as that may suggest you have a different diagnosis in most cases you can manage this disease at home but in some situations people may need to be hospitalized some of those include severe dehydration inability to keep anything down bloody diarrhea severe belly pain symptoms lasting more than a week older age pregnant patients and people with many other health problems such as diabetes or those with a weakened immune system how do you prevent the stomach flu the virus is spread
