more effective safer and tolerable treatments we have generated our clinical product candidates through our orascovery and src kinase inhibition research platforms which are based on our understanding of human absorption biology and novel approaches to inhibiting kinase activity respectively we believe that our ability to overcome the challenges of oral delivery of chemotherapy and convert

the limitations of iv chemotherapy involve repeated painful iv line insertions potential anaphylactic reactions expensive hospital visits toxic side effects and poor quality of life for cancer

biopharmaceutical company dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery and development of next generation drugs for the treatment of cancer athenex is organized around three platforms including an oncology innovation platform a commercial platform and a global supply chain platform athenex’s oncology innovation platform generates clinical candidates through an extensive understanding of kinases including novel binding sites human absorption biology and through the application of athenex’s proprietary research and selection processes in the lab the company’s current clinical pipeline is derived from two different platform technologies athenex calls orascovery and src kinase inhibition the orascovery platform is based on the novel oral pglycoprotein pump inhibitor molecule hma through which athenex is able to facilitate oral absorption of traditional cytotoxics which athenex believes may offer improved patient tolerability and efficacy as compared to iv administration of the same cytotoxics the src kinase inhibition platform refers to novel small molecule compounds that have multiple mechanisms of action including the inhibition of the activity of src kinase and the inhibition of tubulin polymerization during cell division athenex believes the combination of these mechanisms of action provides a broader range of anticancer activity as compared to either mechanism of action
