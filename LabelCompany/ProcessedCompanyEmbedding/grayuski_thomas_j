into new headquarters at  washington street in  in  a resolution was passed to merge east stroudsburg building  loan with commonwealth building  loan association of stroudsburg and keystone building  loan association of east stroudsburg the merger was completed in  forming east stroudsburg savings association with combined assets of  million essa continued to operate only one office until  when it

inside weis markets and blakeslee in    and  respectively then in  the bank completed construction of the new corporate headquarters in downtown stroudsburg that same year the banks assets reached a milestone at  million east stroudsburg savings association had started out as a traditional thrift institution back  but by  it had become much more than that over the previous  years essa had grown to include a full spectrum of products and services including a highly personalized asset management  trust division with this in mind the institution underwent its third name change since it was first established to essa bank  trust as essa bank  trust the new name more accurately reflected the institution essa had become in  essa determined that the best way to continue its growth was to convert from a mutual to a publicly owned entity essa bancorp inc the holding company for essa bank  trust received regulatory approval to complete its conversion in  and shares of essa bancorp incs common stock began trading on april   on the nasdaq global marketsm under the symbol essa on april   members of essas executive management team and board members traveled to new york city to take part
