establishing consistency through natural product categories used previously adhering to the standards outlined here will strengthen the cummins brand and minimize risk of rogue product names being

platforms and significant product or emission changes any products in production before  will keep their original names and are not within the scope of the engine nomenclature change current names like isg isx and isb will remain the same the new marketing name will be applied only to new production products and the rollout schedule for product name changes will develop as needed in alignment with product plans engine naming standards font  style guidelines  a unique custom font has been designed to accompany the introduction of cummins updated engine marketing nomenclature and standardize

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples

specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
