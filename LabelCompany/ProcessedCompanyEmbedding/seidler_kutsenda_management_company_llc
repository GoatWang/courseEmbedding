companiespartner companies overviewhow we helptestimonialsraegan moyajonessteve kingtoby buckashley edensrich galganochad williamstransaction process about us what makes us different we think about your business the same way you do – as a true partner not just a capital provider flexible partnership approach we are a relationshipdriven firm that strives to genuinely understand our partners short and longterm professional and personal financial objectives because those objectives can vary greatly we emphasize flexibility in developing the right transaction to fit each situation over the past  years we have invested in both minority and majority positions and employed a variety of customized deal structures to achieve our partners’ goals patient investment horizon we invest in growing businesses where we can work collaboratively with our partners to increase a company’s value over time we believe success is most likely to be achieved by implementing a thoughtful plan for smart growth not a risky scheme in search of a quick buck as a result we have established stable and thriving partnerships some of which have spanned more than a decade conservative capital structure we believe the optimal use of cash for most growing companies is to fund expansion not service a heavy debt load we seek to generate investment returns by applying sound business principles and executing insightful growth strategies rather than using maximum leverage experienced valuable partner we help our partner companies achieve their full potential by harnessingthe extensive resources of our professional team we apply decades of strategic operational and organizational experience primarily as boardlevel and projectfocused partners leaving daytoday decisions in the hands of management in addition our network of trusted service providers industry experts financial institutions and acquisition support professionals are valuable assets for executives determined to build and maintain the best business in their industry shared incentive mentality we know every dollar a business earns is the result of a team effort consequently we don’t impose costly fees or other arbitrary external
