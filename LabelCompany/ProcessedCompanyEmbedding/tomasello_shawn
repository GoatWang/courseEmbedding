ramses good afternoon and thank you for joining us today pharmacyclics has delivered another excellent quarter we exceeded wall streets consensus with  demand growth and  bottle shipment growth in our third quarter versus our second quarter were also on track to deliver yet another strong quarter in q as the full month of october results portend excellent continued growth in demand for imbruvica i cannot be more proud of our team at pharmacyclics for laying the groundwork essential to ensuring our continued forward progress this quarter marks our first profitable quarter within the imbruvica collaboration with our partner janssen together pharmacyclics and janssen achieved this vital milestone in less than  years post my handshake with the chief scientific officer of johnson  johnson paul stoffels followed by corporate signatures on december   were thankful for all the valueadd we are receiving from our partner as we continue to achieve and exceed our development and commercial goals set forth almost  years ago as you listen to our call and hear from our executives i want you to keep in mind  key themes leadership and expansion as these are our top priorities in our first commercial year and within our label pharmacyclics and janssen have become the leader in the treatment of relapsedrefractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma from the initiation of over  clinical trials to early on fda breakthrough therapy approvals in  indications pharmacyclics has accomplished in less than  years what usually takes traditional biotech and pharmaceutical companies several years longer during this short period of time we filed an ind for imbruvica and clinically developed this important medicine that we are now successfully marketing around the world importantly we are developing imbruvica and our btk inhibitor program across additional hematology histologies and as of this point in time solid tumors chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases the collective potential opportunity is immense and seldom seen to our credit we have established constructive and consultative relationships with relevant government agencies this enabled us to obtain  marketing labels for imbruvica in the last  months in october we filed for our fourth label within the united states additionally we have in and out license compounds to fortify the robustness of our pipeline we built a strong viable and worldclass commercial organization to fully support and expand our business and weve done all of this in record time thanks in no small part to the highly motivated intelligent and patientfocused teams at pharmacyclics and janssen during the third quarter we established ourselves via a sole source solicitation as a vendor to the united states department of veteran affairs and signed a master agreement with this agency that covers pricing and supply of medicine in our inhouse created autoimmune program we continue exploring our nextgeneration btk inhibitors one of which is being tested in a firstinhuman study in healthy volunteers and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis i would like to caution that this is a phase i study where we remain in the process of determining the safety of the drug and proper dosing as i have in the past i would still classify this program at this point in time as a speculative aspect of the pharmacyclics investment thesis in the past months and just again today we have announced several key collaborations and partnerships which will help us explore additional combinations to apply imbruvica in disease settings where single agent therapies have shown theres room for an increase in efficacy and duration of response as we pursue what the leukemia and lymphoma society call for and i quote a world without blood cancer for patients in need an important addition to the business success we continue to build was our recent announcement welcoming shawn cline tomasello as our chief commercial officer shawn joined us from celgene where she was president of the americas hematology and oncology managing over  billion in revenue before that shawn served as national director of hematology for rituxan at genentech where she was responsible for  billion in revenue at pharmacyclics shes leading a worldclass commercial organization with decades of commercial experience and success together we are dedicated to serve as true allies to patients in need and as a direct result take imbruvica to blockbuster status clearly our immediate commercial goal for imbruvica is to establish it as the backbone treatment for patients suffering from bcell malignancies we intend to build upon our momentum to date and continue to broadly establish imbruvica in the markets we can serve i will now turn the call over to manmeet who will provide more color to the numbers manmeet manmeet singh soni thank you bob and good afternoon everyone were very pleased with our strong performance this past quarter as well as the progress we have made on our longterm growth drivers as bob mentioned we continue to experience strong commercial demand during the third quarter our net product revenue for the third quarter rose to  million an increase of  million or  over the second quarter of  for the  months ended september  our total revenue was  million as compared to  million in the same period last year this increase was primarily due to imbruvica product revenues of  million today we are pleased to announce that due to the growth in our net product revenue the third quarter was the first profitable quarter under our collaboration with janssen i would like to remind everyone that we have reached the first profitable quarter for the collaboration in less than  year after imbruvica came to the market this was accomplished within less than  years of signing our collaboration agreement in december of  which is a great achievement for both companies this continued sequential growth in net product revenues reflect strong physician and patient acceptance for imbruvica the number of bottles shipped for the third quarter increased by over  compared to the prior quarter this trend in bottles shipped is noted on slide  we look forward to more of the same days of inventory in the distribution channel at specialty pharmacies and distributors decreased by approximately  from  days in the second quarter to  days in the third quarter this compares very favorably to the industry average of typically more than  days you will observe a similar strong trend in net demand which is calculated as shipments delivered to specialty pharmacies and distributors adjusted by the change in their inventory levels under that calculation net demand for imbruvica increased from  million in the second quarter to  million in the third quarter an increase of  million or  during the second week of september the selling price of imbruvica increased by  as you will note on slide  due to the timing of this price increase it contributed only  to net demand revenue for the third quarter loss to net adjustments amounted to approximately  for the third quarter as compared to  for the second quarter of  this percentage was in line with our expectation of low doubledigit percentage and the anticipated similar result in the next quarter in discussing nongaap measures we have adjusted for excess amounts stockbased compensation and amortization of intangibles quarteroverquarter on a nongaap basis our net income increased to  million or  of net income per diluted share compared to a net loss of  million or  of net loss per diluted share in the second quarter of  yearoveryear this compares to nongaap net income of  million or  of income per diluted share for the quarter ended september   on the th of july imbruvica received fda approval for the treatment of all deletion p cll patients marking its total indication the p cll approval triggered  million of milestone payments which were recognized as milestone revenue for the third quarter of  subsequent to the third quarter the eu approvals for imbruvica which we announced on october  triggered additional milestone payments from janssen totaling  million these milestone payments will be recorded as milestone revenue in the fourth quarter of  to date in addition to the upfront payment of  million from janssen including these most recent milestones for the eu approval we have earned milestone payments of  million under the agreement as we achieve further targets we can earn an additional  million in milestone payments let me now report on our cost and expenses for the third quarter nongaap cost of goods sold increased to  million in the third quarter as compared to  million in the second quarter the increase is due to royalties to celera which increased because of higher net product revenue and also due to costs associated with our dedicated contract manufacturing facility as a percentage of net product revenue nongaap cost of goods sold was relatively consistent from the back order nongaap rd expenses during the third quarter were  million as compared to  million in the prior year primarily driven by the timing of our clinical trial activities nongaap sga expenses increased to  million from  million in the prior year this increase was driven primarily due to the expansion of our commercial activities for imbruvica after the fda approval for cll and mcl patients as you will recall under the collaboration janssen has funded total excess amounts of  million to date under the collaboration agreement excess amounts including interest would become payable only after the third profitable quarter for the collaboration further after the third profitable quarter excess amounts will be paid back only to the extent of our share of pretax commercial profits as we continue to achieve consecutive profitable quarters for the collaboration the excess amounts would first become due in the second quarter of  we recorded no excess amounts during the third quarter nor do we foresee the use of any excess amounts in the fourth quarter or in future years our financial position remains quite strong our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased to  million as of september   from  million as of june   i would now like to turn the call over to shawn tomasello our chief commercial officer shawn shawn cline tomasello thank you manmeet and good afternoon everyone as i just recently joined ill keep my remarks brief but i wanted to add just a few observations related to my time here so far first id like to say that im truly delighted to have joined pharmacyclics pharmacyclics is a company thats enjoying its first commercial success with sales of imbruvica for the first  indications for mcl and cll patients who have received at least  prior therapy and also for all deletion p cll patients we are reporting growing revenues we are expanding physician and patient awareness and were experiencing overwhelming acceptance in use of imbruvica this is due in no small part to the efforts of the companys very strong commercial team who have seized on the current momentum to continue to educate and promote imbruvica based on its exceptional clinical evidence and its very strong label the result is rapid uptake with significant impact on market share with this important new therapy imbruvica continues to maintain its dominant position as the preferred treatment and market leader in our labeled cll and mcl indications over the past  years ive studied and experienced what it really takes to be successful in this oncology market and i would say that first and foremost you absolutely need a really good product one that significantly differentiates itself from the rest and with imbruvica we have such a medicine as recently as july  imbruvica received a full approval for use in cll patients who had received at least  prior therapy in this indication imbruvica is the only medicine ever to show an overall survival benefit against an active comparator as reflected in our label and as we all know survival is the ultimate endpoint when so many indications come so very quickly for a new agent like imbruvica you really need training and education of the sales force medical affairs and of the health care provider community and this has really been key to our success thus far and will continue to be our focus moving forward over the coming quarters well be focused on continuing to build out our internal sales training programs as well as our medical affairs and physician education programs in order to ensure that we properly message the full potential of imbruvica for patients in order to increase our market share leadership and attain high adoption and adherence rate education will continue to be one of our key drivers in todays market we need to have more creative communication strong academic and community connections and a host of other channel interactions in order to be successful and each channel requires constant communication and a repetition of clear messages a surround sound of communication is critical for success our team has really done a fabulous job in our outreach and our communication strategy and we are continuing to deliver and reinforce our strong messages id now like to take just a few minutes to validate some of our commercial team members and announce  new members to the team matt outten has done a phenomenal job thus far in helping to build pharmacyclics and is now leading in the role of vp of market access and commercial liaison dawn bir who was leading sales for our east region has recently been promoted to vice president of sales she has been a tremendous asset in aligning and building out our field force so congratulations to both matt and dawn im also very pleased to have elizabeth faust on my team who is our vice president of medical affairs and has led many of our educational efforts for the  new members diane parks ph is our new vice president of marketing and kimberly metcalf is our vice president of training and administration ive worked with diane kim and elizabeth in the past and can assure you that they are veterans in the oncology industry and extremely good at what they do with kim diane dawn matt and elizabeth we have a very skilled and experienced leadership team in our marketing sales commercial training medical affairs and market access organization an organization that will elevate pharmacyclics over the coming quarters from my perspective were just scratching the surface and were just getting started we have our team in place we have a clear vision of where were going and a solid plan of how well get there we are passionate about bringing imbruvica to all patients who can benefit from this drug i look forward to sharing further updates with you at our next quarterly call and will now pass the call onto maky mahkam zanganeh thank you shawn and welcome everyone to todays conference call i will now provide you with a general business update and an outlook for the coming year our past  months were very productive in addition to our accelerated approval in mantle cell in november of last year on july  of this year the fda granted full approval for the use of imbruvica in cll patients with at least  prior therapy and all deletion p cll the updated label described key differentiating factors imbruvica can offer a statistically significant improvement in overall survival progressionfree survival and response rate compared to the standard of care of ofatumumab as you can imagine we are still very excited with the full approval and are now even more focused on the further development of the other bcell malignancies since our last conference call we have also received the european approval and are now authorized we are a partner to market imbruvica in the  european member countries in addition to korea israel uruguay our first latin america approval sales have already begun in a few countries which were set up to facilitate an immediate transition to commercial product as is typical in europe the administrational purchases in each country are slightly different and we are thankful for our partner janssens local presence and expertise to ensure minimal delays in the commercial rollout of imbruvica in europe janssen is also pursuing a broad worldwide regulatory filing strategy and is making great progress we will be updating you on further global filing successes during our future quarterlies call as we look at our global presence we further solidify our ip position around the world and most recently were granted a patent covering the active pharmaceutical ingredient for imbruvica and structurerelated btk inhibitor compound by the indian patent office india is considered to be among the top  pharmaceutical emerging markets in the world we would like to thank our head of ip and corporate elaine stracker and her team who worked so diligently to help secure our patent portfolio during this past quarter we also finalized our waldenströms filing and submitted the data to the fda for registration as you may know we received fda breakthrough therapy designation for waldenströms last year this was the third breakthrough designation following the ones for cll and mantle cell we look forward to hearing from the fda in the first half of  we also anticipate the european filing for the use of imbruvica in waldenströms patients to take place before the end of this year our clinical plan is expanding as we actively discover further scientific rationale and application for the use of imbruvica in other bcell malignancies and beyond at the american association of cancer research meeting last april imbruvica data was presented in symposium as well as in  oral sessions and in  posters highlights from that meeting included  new preclinical presentations showing the impact of imbruvica in  potential new indications graftversushost disease or gvhd and her breast cancer we have since started to enroll our first gvhd clinical study in an effort to help all patients with complications that can take place after a stem cell or bone marrow transplant in addition we are further exploring the use of imbruvica on tumors excitement from the clinical and discovery research team here at the company around solid tumors is based on our preclinical data that supports antitumor activity of imbruvica via  mechanisms first imbruvica can target the tumor directly by inhibiting nonbtk kinases such as egfr her and other targets second is the effect of imbruvica on the tumor microenvironment by inhibiting activity of protumor bcells mast cells and macrophages and finally imbruvica may modulate t cells by shifting the thth polarity this makes combinations with other immunooncology agents appealing were looking to target tumors in which several of these mechanisms may come into play just today we announced our first collaboration in solid tumors with astrazeneca where we combine imbruvica and astrazenecas antipdl antibody in multiple solid tumor types our goal is to develop real cuttingedge breakthrough therapies that offer safe and effective treatment options to cancer patients options that provides lasting benefits to these patients we are developing plans today to ensure imbruvica will become the best standalone therapy or the backbone of therapies for all bcell malignancies we have made significant progress to turn this aspiration into reality today we have  trials ongoing and over half  in total are in a variety of combination settings which will provide valuable information to help physicians make the very best treatment decision one of these combinations was recently highlighted at the annual meeting of the german society of hematology in october where dr jan burger of md anderson presented a longterm followup to his published study of imbruvica in combination with rituxan in highrisk patients at  months followup he showed an overall response rate of  with a cr rate of  in this highrisk cll patients and he showed how  of these  crs demonstrated mrd negativity over the past quarter we have also added a number of key collaborations which will further explore combination opportunities for patient benefit which is an important part of our strategy this augments our internal rd programs and capabilities with compelling innovative science and technologies to that end we recently announced an agreement with bms to evaluate imbruvica in combination with their investigational pd immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab as a potential treatment option for patients with nhl we also announced our agreement with roche to explore combination with the novel cd antibody gazyva in treatment of naive cll and various nonhodgkins lymphoma in addition we signed several regulation agreements with astrazeneca with their pdl antibody and pi kinase inhibitor for hematological cancers these add to our ongoing clinical development program investigating imbruvica in combination with current standards of care as well as in novel combinations such as our trials with kyprolis in multiple myeloma revlimid and rituxan in diffused large bcell lymphoma and with rituxan in follicular lymphoma to name a few you will see us further strategically add to this list of combinations with worldclass collaboration partners as we continue to explore the potential of imbruvica and its utility in the treatment of cancers lets now turn to an update on what you can expect at this years annual meeting of the american society of hematology in early december so far we have confirmation that there will be at least  data presentations on imbruvica we will see  nonclinical updates and  clinical updates more than half of these updates were generated by independent investigators exploring the potential benefit that imbruvica can offer to patients with bcell malignancies some of the clinical highlights include updates from our ongoing imbruvica trials using novel combinations with imbruvica as well as single agents imbruvica in patients with p cll cllsll multiple myeloma mantle cell follicular marginal zone lymphoma and dlbcl in addition we will share for the very first time early data in burkitts lymphoma we will also learn more about the mechanisms of action of imbruvica and its effect on patient wellbeing the role lymphocytosis plays in these outcomes and the effect of imbruvica under cell survival and tumor macroenvironment in addition data will be presented on the use of anticoagulants and how they have affected patients in our clinical studies as well as the synergy of imbruvica with other agents this years ash is filled with exciting data we are grateful to all these researchers for their continued interest in imbruvica to advance new therapies in support of patients in need finally i would like to provide a top line outlook of the major clinical readout we are expecting to see in the coming year most importantly we are expecting results from our treatmentnaive phase iii cll study resonate in the second half of  im noting this study first because if the results are positive it has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for all cll patients who require treatment we are so excited to have completed enrollment of this study ahead of schedule in february of this year and are now looking forward to this important top line results we anticipate the data from our follicular lymphoma trials to read out towards the second half of  we have preliminary ash data in this easy setting and we feel with a longer followup we will have a more mature update from this larger data set in the second half of  we also will see further clinical updates on our combination trials conducted by janssen in conclusion we will continue to build our leadership position in oncology with a host of new clinical studies a team of experienced scientists highly effective clinical research and commercial organizations entrepreneurial leadership and decisionmaking and most importantly a group of dedicated individuals who day in and day out work the extra hours driven and inspired by all the patients who are so thankful to have their lives back we are here to serve those who are in need and it is my honor and privilege to be a member of this team i will now turn the call back over to bob robert w duggan thank you maky as you review the progress that weve laid out over the last quarter the last year and the past  years and evaluate our plans moving forward you will see us continue to aggressively explore the potentials of imbruvica as of now we have not been able to define its boundaries as a medicine looking to the future growing our pipeline becomes all that much more predictable as we significantly expand our human and financial resources rest assured were very active in the area of business development when and as we have additional relevant data to divulge we will do so it is a matter of when not if operator please open the floor to questions now questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from mike king from jmp securities michael g king  jmp securities llc research division i hate to start out such an exciting quarter with some mundane  relatively mundane stuff but the profitability looked much better than i think anybody had expected so im just wondering if you guys can help us out to think about how we should view profitability in relationship with janssen going forward particularly percent of revenue dedicated to rd and sga and then could you also give us some thoughts about when we might start incorporating taxes into our income statement calculations robert w duggan mike this is bob and then ill turn it over to manmeet that evaluation will be forthcoming as we close our year and yes we look forward to presenting that to you this is a very profitable product and we will judiciously spend money in research and development sga as it will lift our growth rate and make sure that we achieve the full potential of imbruvica for slightly more specifics ill turn you over to manmeet but for a real clear view on  well await our first conference call likely to be in february of  manmeet manmeet singh soni so michael yes thats correct i think currently if you go to slide  of our slide deck were showing  million net profit under the agreement for the current quarter and as you will see with the expansion i think we are anticipating that well not use excess amounts and we will profitable quarters going forward under the collaboration michael g king  jmp securities llc research division i think its great and if i might just add  ask a quick followup maybe one for shawn one you guys stated on the formal remarks that you expect continued growth bob i think you said october is looking good for you for the quarter i just wonder unless the data are inaccurate or unreliable i look at our data from either ims or symphony and it looks to me like the nrx has peaked in around july trx has peaked in august around the time the cll full approval came so im just wondering what do you think the next engine of growth is is it further growth in nrxs is it duration is it persistence is it all of the above maybe you can help us out on that shawn cline tomasello sure mike thanks for the question the answer is all of the above i meant what i said when i think were just getting started we have a good percentage of our physicians that have not yet even prescribed imbruvica its a minority but its still a good opportunity for us i think just like in any other oncology drug that youre launching with the adherence doesnt perfectly mimic the clinical trial in the beginning so we have some opportunity there as well and we have all of the education and the resources in place to make sure that we optimize the opportunity and that patients actually have the best possible outcome on the drug operator and our next question comes from navdeep singh from goldman sachs navdeep singh  goldman sachs group inc research division a couple of quick questions maybe for bob and shawn if you guys could kind of describe what inning youre in in the imbruvica launch in relapsed refractory cll and then bob in your opening remarks you mentioned that october is looking good or better than what youve seen in i guess september and august is there any way you can quantify that and then i have a quick followup robert w duggan well ill start with that last question yes october is in the books and it was an excellent month relative to any previous months weve ever had one would expect growth but the growth was very decent as you know were not going to be giving specific forecasts out and we will evaluate that at yearend as we move into  but i have been telling for the past  quarters and it proved to be accurate that we were starting strong and as you saw in the june quarter to september quarter we finished with relative strength so yes i just  i weigh in on that i know you have the trx the nrx and that data and we caution the use and the value of that but our revenue is being driven by label expansion duration new physicians onboarding and use of combination therapy so i support shawns comment that were still scratching the surface these are early days ill turn the balance over to shawn shawn cline tomasello yes i think you covered it bob and you know a lot more about baseball than i do so ill let you pick the inning navdeep singh  goldman sachs group inc research division okay maybe a quick followup to my previous question were hearing that the eu price for imbruvica came in much higher than expected higher than the us price can you guys please provide any color on that and i apologize for the background noise robert w duggan no thats not something that we should touch on thats really janssens prerogative and thats a very dynamic situation with a lot of moving parts they are the ones driving it so well await their sensibility in terms of describing it operator and our next question comes ian somaiya from nomura securities m ian somaiya  nomura securities co ltd research division i had a few questions first on all the combination studies that youre exploring i was wondering if you could share with us some of the preclinical rationale and maybe just highlight combinations which in your opinion have maybe demonstrated the most provocative data in sort of animal studies and then i just had a followup question for shawn danelle james its danelle james from clinical i can answer that i think we have some really great data on the combination with the cd antibodies which has been a mainstay of therapy for bcell malignancies i think our clinical development program as well as the medical affairs program are really exploiting that interaction and hoping to benefit patients with even deeper responses in addition weve been able to really combine ibrutinib with a number of different chemotherapeutic agents that are available we have some preclinical models that suggest that some of these actually combine in a much more avid ph fashion so were looking forward to demonstrating that within the clinical studies that are ongoing largely in the ist program but also within our own companysponsored programs in terms of the combinations such as chop and well be seeing bendamustinerituximab and ibrutinib combination in the phase iii studies being sorted ph out during the middle of next year and i think most excitingly are the immune checkpoint inhibitors so the pd combinations both the collaboration with cms and also the astrazeneca collaboration that was announced today we see a lot of potential for the combinations not only in bcell malignancies but also in solid tumors preclinical data surrounding that is forth coming and just some of the data that weve seen in terms of how ibrutinib can modulate the tcell responses in patients may lead to more synergistic interactions with those combinations in addition with the diffuse large bcell lymphoma program we have a number of a preclinical studies that suggest that were going to have additive benefit when we combine with lenalidomide an immunomodulatory agent thats made a lot of strides in that disease in addition outside nonhodgkins lymphoma the multiple myeloma program is combining very well with the proteasome inhibitors thats just carfilzomib and we have an ongoing clinical study which you should be seeing clinical data some time in  m ian somaiya  nomura securities co ltd research division as you think about maybe the  larger opportunities that are sort of available to you cll and broadly speaking lymphoma as you get the sort of deeper responses are we  what should we think about as sort of the evolving treatment paradigm are we looking at deeper responses equating to potentially drug holidays for patients or are we looking at deeper responses and then fill the further need to maintain that response maybe if you could speak to the cll and follicular lymphoma independently danelle james i guess ill speak for cll first i think patients and physicians want options some patients are going to be very well served with a single daily oral therapy that they can take for a very long time and be free of their disease symptoms and disease burdens while other patients particularly some of the younger patients might want to achieve deeper response  the deepest response possible and we have clinical trials that will evaluate the use of imbruvica in a situation in which a deep response is achieved and then those patients could potentially go on a drug holiday those studies will read out in years to come so that data is not readily accessible to us right now we just announced our phase iii studies in cll looking at ibrutinib and gazyva versus gazyva chlorambucil with an attemptph really to bring in deep responses for patients with treatment naive cll so well be looking for the results of that data in terms of the cr and mrd negative response ill turn it over to darrin if you want to comment on follicular lymphoma darrin beaupre just in lymphoma in general i think its a bit premature to be talking about that level of response from the perspective of the nonhodgkins lymphoma programs are obviously further behind the cll programs which are more advanced in nonhodgkins lymphoma were obviously trying to find the niche in which imbruvica will bring the greatest benefit to patients with both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large bcell lymphoma so there are a number of combination trials and single agent trials underway that will really help define the space in which imbruvica will make its most prominent contribution in nonhodgkins lymphomas and again there the molecular characteristics of the tumors will be crucial as weve already presented in diffuse large bcell lymphoma and we do hope to do in follicular lymphoma in the nottoodistant future m ian somaiya  nomura securities co ltd research division okay and just one final question for shawn just given your sort of vast experience in this space can you maybe draw parallels to your initial sort of experience on rolling out rituxan and then also revlimid shawn cline tomasello yes there are a lot of parallels the biggest parallel is that we have a product thats going to be just absolutely amazing and not just bcell malignancies but beyond that and that was the number one  ill just call it it was the catnip for me to come for pharmacyclics is the science so thats the common theme through all of my experience is amazing science if i compare circa   celgene with pharmacyclics today its about the same number of employees and i would say that we are in very very good shape at pharmacyclics with respect to our clinical development program our execution our commercial talent that we have in place we have all of the ingredients for a blockbuster and im really happy to be here operator and our next question comes from jason kantor from crédit suisse jason kantor  crédit suisse ag research division a couple of questions can you speak at all to what sort of duration of therapy youre seeing out there now that youve been on the market for some time and also bob you mentioned the contract with va im wondering if you could give us some sense of what type of order flow youre now getting from that channel i dont think that thats explicitly captured in some of the databases so is that a growing portion of the business or is that a stable portion of the business maybe you can comment on that robert w duggan it was quite nominal as we concluded q because the contract was signed in september i believe that it will take a while to gradiently penetrate the potential of that contract so were going to go after it in terms of heavy service and educate to activate within the va community were very pleased that we have the sole source solicitation and we well weigh in with each coming quarter as to the progress that were making jason kantor  crédit suisse ag research division and then on duration of therapy robert w duggan danelle do you want to touch on that duration of therapy danelle james yes i think that we have a lot of confidence in our clinical trial experience and some of this i think youll see in detail at ash weve shown that now in hundreds of patients weve been able to replicate our early phase data from our original pivotal studies so i think its just a matter of time before we can get the similar kind of duration and adherence that we see in the clinical trials to really marry up with the commercial space and i believe that educational efforts of the medical affairs team and the efforts of the commercial team will really help bring into par the experience that weve seen in the clinical trials jason kantor  crédit suisse ag research division and then just  quick followups on the inventory can you give the dollar value of the total inventory or change in inventory i think youve given that in previous quarters and can you speak to how socially sensitive the markets are for imbruvica manmeet singh soni sure this is manmeet our inventory in dollar value increased from approximately  million at the end of second quarter to  million at the end of third quarter which was just a really nominal increase in capsule if you calculate in a capsule form its just  growth in the number of capsules but the impact of that inventory was just  in the total net demand revenue which we have shown on slide i believe  operator and our next question comes from brian skorney from robert w baird brian p skorney  robert w baird  co incorporated research division bob your comments around  and i know youve just been saying this around the autoimmune btk that you encourage us to look at this as speculative value proposition i wonder if we just kind of put aside the cll mantle cell waldenströms opportunities could you kind of give us your view in order of least to most speculative bets here if i throw out like autoimmune btk ibrutinib in myeloma ibrutinib in solid tumors in dlbcl and in follicular how you would kind of rank those robert w duggan being the researcher and doctor that i am not i would rather turn that over to my august ph team and danelle you can weigh in and also others that darrin beaupre so i mean the long and short of it is we obviously have made tremendous strides in our breakthrough therapy designations right we have the cll the mantle cell and the waldenströms macroglobulinemia which is leading the way for us now we obviously still have a lot of work to do in bcell malignancies and the  big targets that are sitting there for us to explore are the nonhodgkins lymphomas right the diffused large bcell lymphoma and the follicular lymphoma we are aggressive in looking at those  diseases in multiple lines of therapy with multiple combination partners and this is an area that we really want to have success and we believe itll just be a matter of time and then of course there are other indications that were excited about were beginning to learn more about the multiple myeloma space and then of course we have chronic graftversushost disease which is an area of great excitement for us due to the fact that were talking about an effect on both b and tcells which are critical to the pathophysiology of chronic graftversushost disease in addition to all this were leaving no stone uncovered where theres a number of other bcell malignancies we are working with investigators in terms of investigatorsponsored trials to look at other areas in which imbruvica could be active and then finally the press releases from today within the immunooncology space  again this was mentioned previously with respect to our preclinical data an area that were pursuing aggressively with  separate partners looking at both an approach that targets pd the receptor and its ligand and so you probably get the sense that were very excited about this area with the number of trials and collaborations that we have its hard to rank those all but if you put it all in a collage what you have is  opportunities that are leading the way that appear to be doing very well and then these others hard to exactly rank them but its clear that its hard to imagine that imbruvica is not going to come through in several of these areas and we really believe in the compound and we think we can have a significant impact in bcell malignancies and beyond brian p skorney  robert w baird  co incorporated research division great and just last quarter you guys presented a slide where you showed penetration in the second line plus of cll and mcl i just wondered can you give us any color on what that looked like in third q and also in particular if there was any incremental upswing in terms of any frontline use in either indication shawn cline tomasello this is shawn we continue to see a very dominant position in market share for mantle cell lymphoma and for cll and in cll our business is growing in all lines of therapy operator and our next question comes from cory kasimov from jpmorgan cory william kasimov  jp morgan chase  co research division i guess first ones a commercial question im wondering if youve seen any commercial impact from the approval of zydelig shawn cline tomasello this is shawn very little impact at this point cory william kasimov  jp morgan chase  co research division okay and then from a clinical standpoint can you maybe set the stage for us for how we should be thinking about the potential of imbruvica in multiple myeloma ahead of the ash meeting its one of the indications thats kind of  hasnt really been talked about for a while and well get some data on that coming up soon unknown executive i can take the question so the multiple myeloma data we hope to present at the upcoming ash meeting this will be actually be kind of premature data or kind of first trial on multiple myeloma with or without dexamethasone so there will be hopefully mature data presented at this meeting we also announced that per critical prespecified criteria there was an extension core in the study based on the response data and were kind of very happy to announce that this kind of enrollment has been completed and we actually will receive more mature data at this one in regards to the other trial in multiple myeloma we currently discussed in combination with carfilzomib so far we are actually doing very well we are ahead of schedule and data will be announced somewhere in the midnext year and so were  get any kind of read out on the carfilzomib combination front operator and our next question comes from katherine xu from william blair yu xu  william blair  company llc research division just curious about your collaboration with bms and az can you just elaborate on the rationale a little bit more is it one is pdl inhibitor and the other one is pd inhibitor why choose hemonc versus solid tumor with different immune checkpoint inhibitors and also i guess with az you also have hemonc indications in there how that differentiates from the hemoncs indications that youre working with bms and just more detail on the rationale darrin beaupre well as mentioned previously i mean were obviously excited about the combination for the number of mechanisms that may be operative both in liquid tumors and solid tumors i mean if you think about it imbruvica has obviously a direct impact on bcell malignancies and it may also have a similar impact on solid tumors based on the fact that its able to inhibit other targets in addition to btk and of course the checkpoint inhibitors they have been tested clinically there has been evidence of antitumor activity both in solid and liquid tumors and the fact that imbruvica can play a role in the tcell thth ratio that may augment the effects of checkpoint inhibitors is exciting to us and so as you might imagine were using all of this information together understanding what tumor were interested in understanding what micro environment that tumor might be in understanding where the checkpoint inhibitors have had activity and putting all that information together to determine where is the best opportunity for us with imbruvica and youll be hearing more details from us in the future yu xu  william blair  company llc research division so there could be some overlap between the  collaborations in terms of indications or particular ash sites that youre working on darrin beaupre yes were not really talking too much in detail about some of the indications i dont think theyve all been released but suffice it to say there may be some overlap the fact of the matter is is we dont know at this point in time whether targeting the receptor may be adequate or getting after the ligand  and there may be a toxicity difference between the  as well particularly in combination with a drug like imbruvica were so convinced that this is an area that requires a significant investigation that we feel is justified by looking at  different molecules  different mechanisms of action and this area is a great opportunity for us and thats why were proceeding operator and our next question comes from salveen richter from suntrust salveen j richter  suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division im just wondering if you could speak to the duration of therapy in relapse refractory cll and mcl in the realworld setting versus what youve seen in clinical studies and then i have a followup shawn cline tomasello sure this is shawn ill talk to that just a little bit and then danelle if you want to add anything so we see duration variance by prescriber and by disease thats just the nature of launching a drug then you see variation between the prescriber philosophy and experience we actually see a better duration and adherence rate with those prescribers who have more experience with the drug and as physicians gain additional experience that improves over time we see a variation in patient characteristics we also see some patients switching of channels of where theyre getting their drug so its really hard to measure but we are all over this issue and opportunity its more of an opportunity than an issue really we have a chart review ongoing right now with over  charts that by year end well have a much better understanding of the reallife practices that are going on but if you look at our growth our revenue our penetration things are going very well but any time youre talking about an oncology drug and adherence theyre always things that you can do in the market to improve both adherence and duration and were doing all of those things salveen j richter  suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division can you just mention or just give some clarity on the timing of dlbcl enrollment and readouts and then you did mention with imbruvica a combination approach is bestsuited in multiple myeloma so with additional programs that are set to readout just wondering where youre thinking of going in terms of combination of purchase darrin beaupre do you want to talk about the timing maria fardis i can talk about  thank you for the question if youre referring to  theres a number of dlbcls studies that we have ongoing just about all of them are either on target or ahead of schedule if i may just summarize it that way this is maria does that address your question on enrollment salveen j richter  suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division sure darrin beaupre i think the next question was about multiple myeloma unknown executive so quickly were actually looking actively and whatever kind of data we actually have to explore multiple myeloma is also where our strong medical affairs team comes into play we have internal studies ongoing and we are also evaluating kind of the best next steps for multiple myeloma with various combination partners in different kinds of settings operator and our next question comes from michael yee from rbc capital markets michael j yee  rbc capital markets llc research division a couple of quick ones in inhl the dawn study which is readout next year can you remind us what the phase i data was in that setting either response rates or duration or progressionfree survival types of data in phase i so that we have an understanding of what it showed previously and can  at least try to compare some of that data to another drug that just got approved there so we can have an understanding of that profile second question was in multiple myeloma i know its been discussed a little bit here but to be specific in the monotherapy studies and in combination with dex is there a specified hurdle rate to achieve a go nogo there at all or is there are no sort hurdle rate its just sort of make a decision based on what you see and then same with the kyprolis combination study is there a specific go nogo prespecified response rate criteria unknown executive just in regards to the myeloma program for our monotherapy study with or without dexamethasone we have protocols prespecified gonogo whereas this time we will not actually go in too much detail into the discussion of approval stage but again based on this kind of gonogo criteria which we actually prespecified the goal of the criteria was met therefore we expanded on it for the carfilzomib trial right now its kind of in the phase i dose escalation setting we made very good progress we went through most of the cohorts and will actually have finalization of the initial kind of dose escalation stage hopefully conducted within  months ph and then there are also as you can actually see what we will do is to have a better understanding about the tumor growth we will do an extension within the phase i so we actually have a better understanding on safety and also on highlevel indiscernible before we actually continue to move forward michael j yee  rbc capital markets llc research division okay and then inhl just remind us what  how many patients were treated in sort of a double refractory setting in phase i and remind us what the response rate is there and any sort of pfs data was there in phase i just so we know where that profile is darrin beaupre yes that study didnt really have too many patients with follicular lymphoma so when you read that data you obviously have to look at it with some caution there was about  or  patients with a response rate of around  and a duration of response of around a year so obviously we have trials ongoing that are addressing this patient population you know about the trial the single arm phase ii thats going at the relapse refractory patient population we obviously have another study were excited about in the second line setting in combination with chemoimmunotherapy which would be considered the standard of care either chopr or bendamustine or rituxan then of course we also have a firstline trial in follicular lymphoma with rituxan and ibrutinib along with a number of ist trials so we are actively and aggressively pursuing follicular lymphoma i would like to emphasize that the thing that we would like to do better and we will do better and were in the process of doing better is to understand that disease to the level that were beginning to understand diffuse large bcell lymphoma where we can subclassify diffuse large bcell lymphoma into  types gcb versus nongcb where we know the subtype that has the greatest benefit to ibrutinib therapy and even further subdivide those patients based on mutational status were not there yet with follicular lymphoma but were collecting tissue from patients on our trials and were hoping in the nottoodistant future to be able to give you the information to tell you that we have a better understanding of whos going to benefit the greatest in follicular lymphoma and where ibrutinib will be the biggest part of a treatment regimen for that disease operator and our next question comes from brian allen ph from stifel unknown analyst just one quick one for bob outside of imbruvica as you look at the current pipeline in pharmacyclics can you give us a sense of what is driving your enthusiasm there and if you were looking to add to your pipeline from external candidates what type of pipeline assets would you look for robert w duggan thank you allen ph first the key here is imbruvica earlier known as  weve yet to push and match up with the boundaries and so we will not be leaving that target alone until we do thats why we have over  trials and over half of which are in combination therapy and the progress that were making in multiple myeloma has not been considerable second we have off that same scaffold but under a different patent our own selfinspired molecules its the  series and behind that we have  backup compounds and were investing significant money to really come to a better understanding of where they will be applicable in the therapy of patients in need off our view is that with bcell receptors were entering a real condition of affluence and understanding penetration recognition in the physician environment as well as patient environment so we necessarily want to leverage that our field force is strong our marketing group is strong so you will see us incrementally develop weve seen the power as ive seen in other businesses ive been in of being a firstmover of being a dominant player either a  or  in providing a differentiated value in your products so we will continue along those lines so the first extension for imbruvica is the  series the second extension is really a combination therapy and beyond that i think as were now exploring pd and pdl we will see opportunities as they might arise for either merger acquisition in license so we are incredibly active in this space well be judicious but that program consumes the expansion program of molecules it really commands a great deal of our attention so thats why we said leadership is a very important aspect of the companys attention as is being able to dominate our space in whatever we pursue so strategically i hope that answers your question operator and our next question comes from geoff porges from bernstein geoffrey c porges  sanford c bernstein  co llc research division so to follow up on this theme of combinations youve made huge progress in a number of different areas do you continue to think theres an opportunity to study imbruvica with bcl inhibitors that would be interesting secondly could you talk a little bit about p particularly what proportion of the patients that youre now supplying drug to are p and what penetration into the p incident pool youve managed to achieve in a relatively short order given the unmet need there and then lastly could you just talk a little bit more about resonate and how much variability there is in the time is that an eventdriven pfs end point and could that come any sooner than the back half of next year danelle james i can address the p question performance indiscernible from clinicals although i cant say the exactly the number of patients weve penetrated p specific for line of therapy i can tell you that in the general population youll see about  to  of the patients with p dilution on the front line and we do have a similar indication in the eu although a little bit flatter in the language where our frontline approval also includes patients with p mutations and that increases the number probably almost doubles the number in the frontline setting available for therapy geoffrey c porges  sanford c bernstein  co llc research division i was mistaken were aware of the incidents of p but just wondering what the incidence of p is in your treated patient pool or is it roughly the same shawn cline tomasello this is shawn we dont have data at this point that breaks it down by p deletion danelle james although i would suspect that this is the first approval of p deletion to be allowed in the united states and the only approval prior to this all international consensus guideline recommended transplant in first response with patients with p deletion so now theres a new standard of care and kind of speaking towards the duration and the appearance in clinical studies this is a paradigm shifting drug cll patients were never treated before with this daily oral therapy they never had to remember to take pills once a day so theres a lot of educational effort and getting the word out but i think the message is a really clear one and once well have that message the adoption will come darrin beaupre with respect to abt obviously its a drug of interest in the nonhodgkins lymphoma space and there are investigativesponsored trials that will be looking at combinations that include imbruvica so stay tuned thats an area that youll be hearing more geoffrey c porges  sanford c bernstein  co llc research division right and then lastly on resonate danelle james resonate is an eventbased analysis it also has a timed kind of window and the details are fairly well known for that studied endpoint but you wont be hearing about it any sooner than the second quarter time  or the second half of next year operator and our next question comes from robyn karnauskas from deutsche bank robyn s karnauskas  deutsche bank ag research division so big picture of the clinical trial enrollment just want to make sure that wont affect revenues there will be a lot of trials and then i was just going to follow up on this combination discussion recently tgtx got an fda for doing a combo with cd with a very simple endpoint response rate and these trials make it a very long time to complete so if you do inlicense something could this take a long time to bring that drug to market unless theres a shorter path i want to get your thoughts on where you think the regulatory staff is where their heads are at as far as potential for approving drugs on an earlier endpoint when we know that people on imbruvica live for a very long time but these trial would take forever and affect ph their chance for survival urte gayko sure i mean  this is urte i mean we basically are equally interested in following those views in terms of potential registration strategy in the space i think for us the tg news is in general very favorable because theyre often used as the backbone as was pointed out so i mean i think we have already shown that we are pretty much exploring any surrogate endpoint that ultimately is usable for registration and then ultimately for approvals so i think we are continuously committed to that i think we have been indiscernible in many studies waldenström is clearly also our most recent effort in that regards because no drug has previously been approved so we will continue discussions about the details of regulatory endpoint there but anyway we are  just to confirm we are very open and we will use all of these approaches as they are emerging robyn s karnauskas  deutsche bank ag research division and a followup on ash data for follicular what are we going to learn from that data and how much followup time will there be for that data set urte gayko for which one specifically robyn s karnauskas  deutsche bank ag research division for the ash data that you said would be follicular lymphoma im not sure of the name of the study that would be at ash there would be some follicular data there darrin beaupre so that study only has about  the median followup is about  months so its pretty short so you have to keep that in mind i think one of the things that youve heard before in mantle cell lymphoma is that responses increase over time so i think that data set is still a bit less mature than wed like to see but its interesting nonetheless this is a very very heavily pretreated patient population significant proportion have had transplant significant proportion have high flipi scores significant proportion refractory coming on therapy you have to keep all those things in mind and again with a short followup time again its just i think just the tip of the iceberg where were probably going to be in follicular lymphoma operator and due to time constraints we do have time for one more question and our next question comes from jonathan eckard from citi joon lee this is actually joon lee dialing in for jon i understand that you mentioned that your autoimmune or information program is speculative but there does seem to be other btks in development for this indication so can you  what can you say about ibrutinib or imbruvica that is differentiated that gives you hope that this will work in autoimmune indications for example do you have any other potential offtarget effects that makes this more promising than other btk inhibitors in development robert w duggan alvina alvina chu this is alvina chu we are very excited about our autoimmune program it is very early right now we are in a firstinhuman study with our btk inhibitor and it does have differences in its physical properties in terms of pk and pd compared to imbruvica were currently not commenting any further on the details of the properties of our btk inhibitor and autoimmune darrin beaupre the only thing id add to that is obviously were real excited about the space i mean it makes sense to inhibit btk in autoimmune diseases so its just the excitement is there but the data will have to play out but its an area of great excitement for autoimmune ph operator thank
