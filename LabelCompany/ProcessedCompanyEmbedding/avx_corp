fountain inn south carolina it is the largest industrial employer in horry county south carolina with almost  workers in myrtle beach and conway avx has  employees and operates in the united states europe and asia  sales were  billion capital expenditure for the year  was at a fiveyear low of  million  lower than the year before and  times less than in  earnings per share grew  even though total sales fell although revenue grew with each successive quarter since april  it is a subsidiary of kyocera electronics corporation  contents  products  history  litigation  references  external links

including ceramic and tantalum capacitors connectors are used in the automotive and medical industries major customers of avx include motorola nokia and robert bosch gmbh asia accounts for  percent of avx sales historyedit avx began in  making ceramic capacitors as a subsidiary of aerovox corporation a company founded in  as radiola wireless corporation which made radios in june  avx became the parent company when assets of aerovox were sold that same year marshall d butler who played a major role in the companys growth became chairman and ceo butler cofounded alloys unlimited inc in  which was sold to londonbased plessey co in  butler stayed for several years as president of the plessey subsidiary with his experience in the semiconductor field butler decided avx should emphasize multilayer ceramic capacitors mlcs used in the rapidly expanding integrated circuit field butler sold two other divisions and started a fiveyear plan the companys  million investment and careful analysis of the market resulted in  sales of  million and dominance of the market the goal based on  percent annual growth had been  million avx added operations in europe but moving into japan proved more difficult the companys license would not let it sell in japan but kyocera corporation could sell its products in the united states kyocera ceo kazuo inamori agreed with butler that the situation needed to be changed and kyocera ended the unfair provision in  avx started a japanese subsidiary during the s growth continued with  sales reaching  million but that year it became clear that computer manufacturers had bought more capacitors than needed and a slowdown began in the industry avx continued to grow through new product research and buying other companies by the end of the decade sales reached  million in the late s the european operations of avx represented onefourth of sales avx wanted to manufacture parts for kyocera which had only  percent of its sales in europe and hoped to increase that before the european community made that more difficult inamori wanted to buy avx rather than partner with the company after a  million stock purchase avx has operated as part of kyocera corp since january   butler retired as ceo in  but remained on the board of directors benedict p rosen an employee since the companys start became the new ceo by  sales reached almost  billion after significant growth for personal computers and cell phones at the same time the automotive home appliance and medical industries needed electronic components and advanced electronic systems needed capacitors as well avx also sold kyocera products worldwide and helped the company start operations in mexico and indonesia kyocera helped avx start manufacturing connectors in  kyocera sold onefourth of avx for  million which more than returned the companys investment in avx even though kyocera still owned threefourths of the company avx used the money to enter the connector business and increase its manufacturing of ceramic and tantalum capacitors the boom in the capacitor industry once again proved temporary after customers bought more products than they needed but in  personal computers and cell phones contributed to more growth as did newer electronics in cars at the same time material prices went up and an asian currency crisis added to avxs troubles layoffs resulted but by  the company was doing well again adding operations in el salvador and the czech republiclanškroun by the end of fiscal  avx had  plants in  countries  employees and sales of  billion but a recession put an end to the good times and revenues dropped to  billion employee numbers totalled  production moved to the czech republic in the late s and china from  onwards the industry situation appeared to improve by  though avx still lost money in april  the company decided to close a number of its smaller worldwide factories including its flagship manufacturing plant in paignton uk following the credit crunch in an effort to reduce costs and remain financially viable for shareholders on december   avx announced it would move corporate headquarters to greenville south carolina with about  jobs leaving the myrtle beach area the company planned no change to manufacturing in conway and myrtle beach in  avx announced plans to tear down the original myrtle beach plant built in  and updated in  with manufacturing operations continuing at a nearby location on the same land the demolition took place in  litigationedit in  myrtle beach property owners near the avx plant filed suit claiming trichloroethylene tce used at the plant until the s has polluted their neighborhood and lowered property values another lawsuit claimed the pollution had stopped a condominium development in the area a consultant for one of the land owners horry land co discovered the pollution in  while doing environmental testing prior to development of a portion of the land in  avx claimed myrtle beach air force base caused at least part of the pollution and the company added the air force to one of several lawsuits a geologist for avx claims the pollution could be cleaned up in five years and horry land is not entitled to compensation while the consultant for horry land claims there is no way to tell how long cleanup will take since avx has been trying to clean up its own pollution for  years on february   federal judge terry wooten ruled that evidence in the horry land suit showed the plaintiffs were entitled to a trial on february   the trial began in florence south carolina in may  wooten ruled that avx caused the pollution and county property records show that avx purchased  acres of contaminated land for  million avx appealed wootens  decision on whether the air force should help with the cost of cleanup sc dhec stated in a march   letter that pollution in some areas came from avx but in one area another source was responsible avx argues that the governments expert who said groundwater from the base flowed away from the polluted areas was not qualified to testify about groundwater the findings could influence an upcoming classaction lawsuit by property owners on oct   the sun news reported that a panel of federal appeals court judges had indicated that they would not overturn a lower courts ruling thereby granting the electronics components manufacturer a new trial on its groundwater contamination case avx claimed that us district court judge terry wooten made a legal error in its  trial by allowing an unqualified expert witness to testify on july   a jury was selected for the second of three lawsuits regarding pollution on land owned by jds development of myrtle beach llc which asked for damages and lost income from condominiums that were never built avx counters that the economic downturn caused the failure of the southern pines project and blames the air force for part of the pollution the suit was filed in  and the trial was scheduled for  but insufficient jurors led to a delay the jury awarded  in actual damages and  in punitive damages to jds but avx wanted that amount reduced to no more than  claiming jds did not provide expert testimony to support its views or evidence southern pines would have been a success on october   it was announced that avx agreed to pay  million to the owners of  properties with tce contamination property owners still needed to approve the settlement which attorney gene connell called reasonable the agreement would mean the dismissal of a classaction suit filed nearly seven years earlier documents filed august   show that property owners could sue avx after a majority of the sc supreme court reversed a decision by circuit court judge benjamin culbertson to dismiss their case the ruling allows the determination of whether the facts of the case will result in a stigma damages policy referencesedit  a b c d avx corp  fiscal year sec k report
