this review translated comment see original hide original    year ago waltham overlook ive had the most amazing experience in this complex from the beautifully renovated kitchen to the spacious bedrooms the well maintained grounds and the pool for that crazy summer heat waltham overlook has everything a tenant can ask for unassigned extra parking youll never have to worry about finding a spot this place truly has it all  week ago would not recommend this complex was gorgeous when we signed our lease july  soon after we moved in september the ownership changed hands the office emptied out and residents were forgotten the maintenance team is still great but it is impossible to get ahold of anyone with questions they shut down the online portal so we could no longer pay rent online which is super inconvenient when we go away over the week when it is due we are trying to give  days notice to move out an no one is answering calls or getting back to us the leasing agent todd is not helpful at all and just tries passing us off to someone else who doesnt answer calls we have no email to use to contact anyone other than that there is no ac unit in the bedroom so the summer is unbearable and the winters extra dry there is no air flow so the living room unit does not make the bedroom cold at all and we are slowly dying in there overall it has been an ok space to live in and is convenient location to my job but if you want a community this is not the place to be nearby amenities time and distance from waltham overlook public transportation points of interest airport drive

original hide original responded to this review translated comment see original hide original    year ago waltham overlook ive had the most amazing experience in this complex from the beautifully renovated kitchen to the spacious bedrooms the well maintained grounds and the pool for that crazy summer heat waltham overlook has everything a tenant can ask for unassigned extra parking youll never have to worry about finding a spot this place truly has it all  week ago would not recommend this complex was gorgeous when we signed our lease july  soon after we moved in september the ownership changed hands the office emptied out and residents were forgotten the maintenance team is still great but it is impossible to get ahold of anyone with questions they shut down the online portal so we could no longer pay rent online which is super inconvenient when we go away over the week when it is due we are trying to give  days notice to move out an no one is answering calls or getting back to us the leasing agent todd is not helpful at all and just tries passing us off to someone else who doesnt answer calls we have no email to use to contact anyone other than that there is no ac unit in the bedroom so the summer is unbearable and the winters extra dry there is no air flow so the living room unit does not make the bedroom cold at all and we are slowly dying in there overall it has been an ok space to live in and is convenient location to my job but if you want a community this is not the place to be nearby amenities time and distance from waltham overlook public transportation
