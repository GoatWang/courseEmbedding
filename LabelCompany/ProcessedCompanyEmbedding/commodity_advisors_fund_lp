components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels a “smart” contract roll approach  smart contract roll approach – a futures contract roll approach designed to select cost

changes intramonth risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high low or noncorrelation to stocks and bonds disciplined quantitative rulesbased approach to commodity investing why commodities not just commodities – longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities this limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s longterm performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund seeks to match the performance of the auspice broad commodity er index abceri which provides exposure to  commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends this longflat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise and mitigate risk by going flat to cash when prices fall why consider longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise however these longonly commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic individual commodity subsectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments significant drawdowns can be damaging to the longterm performance of a portfolio

and other arrangements with the commodity broker are fair reasonable and competitive for the year ended december   the programs traded by the major commodity trading advisors on behalf of the partnership were aventis  aventis diversified commodity strategy and je moody  jem commodity relative value program the general partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets to an advisor at any time and may allocate assets to additional advisors at any time as of december   and as of september   the partnerships assets were allocated among the advisors in the following approximate percentages advisor december   september   aventis       je moody       aventis asset management llc aventis will trade the partnerships assets in accordance with its aventis diversified commodity strategy formerly known as the barbarian program and before that the misfit barbarian program a proprietary and discretionary trading program developed and refined by aventis which is the synthesis of disparate fundamental views and technical indicators overlaid with strict risk management policies on a position sector and portfolio basis aventis has traded its aventis diversified commodity strategy for client accounts since september  the aventis diversified commodity strategy has the following characteristics • ensemble of three subprograms the aventis diversified commodity strategy is based on an ensemble of three discretionary subprograms spreads directional and shortterm trading this type of trading is based primarily on the fundamentals of the market ie changes in supply or demand of a commodity it will also include supply and demand of the pit ie discovery of over bought and over sold conditions • spread trading approximately  of trading activity will be based on calendar intramarket and intermarket spreads intramarket spreads are where one is simultaneously long and short different delivery months of the same contract ie long april live cattle versus short june live cattle intermarket spreads are where one is long one contract and simultaneously short a completely different contract ie long december natural gas and short december crude oil • directional trading approximately  of the strategy is directional in nature utilizing outright and spread positions • shortterm trading approximately  of the strategy is involved in shortterm trading • markets followed the aventis diversified commodity strategy trades on behalf of the partnership in the following markets among others grains currencies energies softs livestock and metals • risk management effective risk management is also a crucial aspect of the program account size expectation volatility of markets traded and the nature of other positions taken are all factors in deciding whether to take a position and determining the amount of equity committed to that position   please note that the percentage of assets allocated to the three discretionary subprograms spreads directional and shortterm trading will be made pursuant to aventiss sole discretion and not in order to maintain any constant percentage allocation among the different subprograms as a result the amount of assets allocated to each subprogram  both on a dollar amount and percentage basis  will vary greatly over the life of the partnership trading decisions may require the exercise of judgment by aventis therefore successful trading may depend on aventis trading ability knowledge and judgment aventis will exercise its judgment and discretion in interpreting the data generated by the aventis diversified commodity strategy including selecting the markets which will be followed and actively traded in addition aventis will determine the method by which orders are placed the types of orders that are to be placed the overall leverage for the portfolio and when applicable the time at which orders are placed with and executed by a broker the trading program to be followed by aventis does not assure successful trading investment decisions made in accordance with the aventis diversified commodity strategy will be based on an assessment of available market information however because of the large quantity of information at hand the number of available facts that may be overlooked and the variables that may shift any investment decision must in the final analysis be based on the judgment of aventis the decision by aventis not to trade certain markets or not to make certain trades may result at times in missing price moves and hence profits of great magnitude which other trading advisors who are willing to trade these markets may be able to capture aventiss approach is dependent in part on the existence of certain technical or fundamental indicators there have been periods in the past when there were no such market indicators and those periods may recur aventis believes that the development of a trading strategy is a continual process as a result of further analysis and research changes have been made from time to time in the specific manner in which the aventis diversified commodity strategy evaluates price movements in various markets and it is likely that similar revisions will be made in the future as a result of such modifications the program that may be used by aventis in the future will differ from that used by aventis in the past and might differ from that presently being used the aventis diversified commodity strategy is a proprietary and confidential program and the foregoing description is of necessity general and is not intended to be exhaustive consequently an investor will not be able to determine the full details of the program or whether the program is being followed there can be no assurance that any trading strategy of aventis will produce profitable results or will not result in losses j e moody  company llc the jem commodity relative value program is a systematic program that uses quantitative models to detect and exploit price shifts and mispricings between related instruments in the energy metal and agricultural markets while employing hedging methods to maintain approximate market or sector neutrality the strategies do not make unhedged directional bets most trades are implemented using offsetting long and short positions in futures and futures options thus reducing exposure to sudden changes in market direction as examples such offsetting positions may be in different delivery months of the same commodity market eg calendar or butterfly spreads in different but related markets eg crude oil and unleaded gasoline or between contracts traded on different exchanges eg new york and london copper market coverage for the jem commodity relative value program portfolio includes crude oil and petroleum distillates natural gas industrial metals precious metals grains livestock foodstuffs fibers and potentially other commodities je moody utilizes primarily exchangetraded futures and futures options to implement its relative value trades although trades may also be made using other instruments such as commodity swaps or otc derivatives contracts the trading opportunities captured by the jem commodity relative value program models are believed to arise due to various factors including changes in relative supply and demand of different commodity contracts the idiosyncratic actions of market participants external events that may disrupt production eg droughts hurricanes labor unrest or geopolitics and risk premia associated with general uncertainties in future supply or demand by virtue of their relative value nature jem commodity relative value program trades may be interpreted as providing market liquidity to directional traders who need it and earning a risk premium by doing so relative value strategies are frequently employed by hedge funds in the equity fixed income convertible bond and option markets but are relatively uncommon in the commodity or managed futures arenas over extended time periods relative value strategies have been observed to produce more consistent returns and higher sharpe ratios than unhedged directional trading strategies with the high leverage often used however some relative value managers have experienced significant losses particularly when extreme market events have occurred   je moody attempts to manage the risk of large losses by limiting the overall portfolio leverage and the degree of exposure to any single commodity market or sector the jem commodity relative value program portfolio typically includes about  to  active relative value trades with the number of open positions depending on the arbitrage opportunities available the jem commodity relative value program trades have low mutual correlation cover multiple markets and sectors and thus enable meaningful diversification within the jem commodity relative value program portfolio when few favorable relative value trading opportunities arise in the commodity markets or as je moody may determine je moody may choose to make relative value trades in the financial futures options swap or derivatives markets at times when many or few trading opportunities are available je moody may increase or reduce the overall jem commodity relative value program portfolio exposure to hedge offsetting long and short positions je moody may use techniques such as static hedging dynamic hedging and option overlays moreover hedging may seek to achieve market or sector neutrality via various benchmarks such as by being contract neutral dollar neutral or delta neutral no hedging strategy is perfect but each has its costs risks advantages and limitations even with wellhedged positions there is usually some residual exposure to directional market movements je moody seeks to balance the advantages of the hedging strategy used in a particular relative value trade versus the costs and risks of implementing the trade the general partner and je moody have agreed that je moody will trade the partnerships assets allocated to je moody at a level that is up to three times the amount of assets allocated no assurance can be given that the advisors strategies will be successful or that they will generate profits for the partnership specific fund level performance information is included in note  to the partnerships financial statements included in item  financial statements and supplementary data for the period january   through december   the average allocation by commodity market sector for each of the funds was as follows mb master fund lp energy   grains   livestock   metals   softs   jem master fund lp energy   grains   livestock   metals   softs   a liquidity the partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services its only assets are its investment in the funds and cash the funds assets consist only of a expense reimbursement mb master only and b equity in trading account consisting of cash and cash margin net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts net unrealized appreciation on forward contracts us treasury bills and options purchased if applicable because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the partnership while substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity no such illiquidity occurred during the year ended december     to minimize the risk relating to low margin deposits the funds follow certain trading policies including i the funds invest their assets only in commodity interests that the respective advisor believes are traded in sufficient volume to permit ease of taking and liquidating positions sufficient volume in this context refers to a level of liquidity that the respective advisor believes will permit it to enter and exit trades without noticeably moving the market ii an advisor will not initiate additional positions in any commodity interest if these positions would result in aggregate positions requiring a margin of more than   of the funds net assets allocated to that advisor iii the funds may occasionally accept delivery of a commodity unless such delivery is disposed of promptly by retendering the warehouse receipt representing the delivery to the appropriate clearinghouse the physical commodity position is fully hedged iv the funds do not employ the trading technique commonly known as pyramiding in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as margin for the purchases or sale of additional positions in the same or related commodities v the funds do not utilize borrowings other than shortterm borrowings if the funds take delivery of any cash commodities vi the advisors may from time to time employ trading strategies such as spreads or straddles on behalf of the funds the terms spread and straddle describe commodity futures trading strategies involving the simultaneous buying and selling of futures contracts on the same commodity but involving different delivery dates or markets vii the funds will not permit the churning of their commodity trading accounts the term churning refers to the practice of entering and exiting trades with a frequency unwarranted by legitimate efforts to profit from the trades driven by the desire to generate commission income from january   through december   the partnerships average margin to equity ratio ie the percentage of assets on deposit required for margin was approximately  the foregoing margin to equity ratio takes into account cash held in the partnerships name as well as the allocable value of the positions and cash held on behalf of the partnership in the name of the funds in the normal course of business the partnership indirectly through its investments in the funds is a party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments these financial instruments may include futures forwards us treasury bills swaps and options whose values are based upon an underlying asset index or reference rate and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates or in the case of derivative commodity instruments to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash through physical delivery or with another financial instrument these instruments may be traded on an exchange a swap execution facility or otc exchangetraded instruments include futures and certain standardized forward option and swap contracts certain swap contracts may also be traded on a swap execution facility or otc otc contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and also include certain forward and option contracts specific market movements of commodities or futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted the purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option the writer or seller of an option has unlimited risk each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risk in general the risks associated with otc contracts are greater than those associated with exchangetraded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an otc contract since may   none of the funds contracts have traded otc although contracts may be traded otc in the future the risk to the limited partners that have purchased redeemable units is limited to the amount of their share of the partnerships net assets and undistributed profits this limited liability is a result of the organization of the partnership as a limited partnership under delaware law   market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the funds due to market changes including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded the funds are exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract the partnershipsfunds risk of loss in the event of counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments the partnershipsfunds risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the partnershipfunds to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events the partnershipfunds had credit risk and concentration risk during the reporting period and prior periods included in this report as msco andor cgm or their affiliates were the sole counterparties or brokers with respect to the partnershipsfunds assets credit risk with respect to exchangetraded instruments is reduced to the extent that through msco andor cgm the counterparty was an exchange or clearing organization the partnershipfunds continue to be subject to such risks with respect to msco the general partner monitors and attempts to control the risk exposure on a daily basis through financial credit and risk management monitoring systems and accordingly believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the partnershipfunds may be subject these monitoring systems generally allow the general partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with riskadjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics in addition online monitoring systems provide account analysis of futures forward and option contracts by sector margin requirements gain and loss transactions and collateral positions see also item  financial statements and supplementary data for further information on financial instrument risk included in the notes to the financial statements the majority of these financial instruments mature within one year of the inception date however due to the nature of the business these instruments may not be held to maturity the partnershipsfunds risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the

risks in the normal course of business the partnership through its investments in the funds is a party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments these financial instruments may include forwards futures swaps and options whose values are based upon an underlying asset index or reference rate and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates or in the case of derivative commodity instruments or to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash through physical delivery or with another financial instrument these instruments may be traded on an exchange or otc exchangetraded instruments are standardized and include futures and certain forward and option contracts otc contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include certain swaps forwards and option contacts specific market movements of commodities or futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted the purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option the writer or seller of an option has unlimited risk each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risk in general the risks associated with otc contracts are greater than those associated with exchangetraded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an otc contract since may   none of the partnership�sfunds� contracts have traded otc although contracts may be traded otc in the future the risk to the limited partners that have purchased redeemable units is limited to the amount of their share of the partnership�s assets and undistributed profits this limited liability is a result of the organization of the partnership as a limited partnership under delaware law market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the funds due to market changes including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded the funds are exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract the partnership�sfunds� risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments the partnership�sfunds� risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the partnershipfunds to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events the partnershipfunds have credit risk and concentration risk as cgm andor msco or their affiliates are the counterparties or brokers with respect to the funds� assets credit risk with respect to exchangetraded instruments is reduced to the extent that through cgm andor msco the partnership�sfunds� counterparty is an exchange or clearing organization as both a buyer and seller of options the funds pay or receive a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option written options expose the funds to potentially unlimited liability for purchased options the risk of loss is limited to the premiums paid certain written put options permit cash settlement and do not require the option holder to own the reference asset the funds do not consider these contracts to be guarantees the general partner monitors and attempts to control the fund�s risk exposure on a daily basis through financial credit and risk management monitoring systems and accordingly believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the partnershipfunds may be subject these monitoring systems generally allow the general partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with risk adjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics in addition online monitoring systems provide account analysis of futures forwards and options positions by sector margin requirements gain and loss transactions and collateral positions the majority of these financial

oak’s trading strategy is driven by fundamentals  therefore unlike many trading strategies now being employed by managed futures professionals red oak’s approach is neither technicallybased nor trendfollowing fundamental analysis in general is based on a study of factors external to the markets in predicting future prices such factors might include among other things supply and demand factors for a particular commodity the economy of a particular country government policies domestic and foreign political and economic events and changing trade prospects fundamental analysis is premised on the concept that market prices frequently may not reflect on a real time basis the actual value of a commodity although such value will eventually determine price levels red oak’s fundamental research disciplines attempt to step beyond the near term “noise” of leveraged volatile markets the firm’s research focus is on significant and somewhat longerterm market forces red oak

inside and outside the united states financial futures may include equity index futures and interest rate futures based both inside and outside the us physical futures include agricultural commodities energies and metals it may also trade forward contracts through banks with regard to financial futures the firm’s research focuses on the macroeconomic trends that affect financial markets valuation levels the level and rate of change in “real” interest rates central bank policy funding needs the level and rate of change of profitability overall financial leverage in the monetary system and numerous other factors that affect the price level and volatility of equity and fixed income financial instruments in the currency markets red oak concentrates its fundamental research on such factors as trade and budget levels and trends political considerations interest rate differentials and changes in interest rates changes in marginal rates of return on capital in various countries central bank policy and many other factors that affect relative currency values and directional changes research regarding physical commodities focuses on macroand microeconomic trends supply and demand balances substitution effects caused by relative price changes political considerations and changes in technology weather and numerous other factors that affect commodities prices the firms employs

strategic indexbased approach to commodity investing exposure to  commodities that can individually be long or flat if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash the ability to make position changes intramonth based on trends monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels a “smart” contract roll approach  smart contract roll approach – a futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract why invest in the fund the longflat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable longonly commodity indices has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intramonth risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high low or noncorrelation to stocks and bonds disciplined quantitative rulesbased approach to commodity investing why commodities not just commodities – longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities this limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s longterm performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund seeks to match the performance of the auspice broad commodity er index abceri which provides exposure to  commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends this longflat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise and mitigate risk by going flat to cash when prices fall why consider longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise however these longonly commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic individual commodity subsectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments significant drawdowns can be damaging to the longterm performance of a portfolio within the inherently volatile commodity markets a longflat approach is potentially more adaptive to whipsawing market conditions fund details component sectors and current positioning metals position longflat copper flat gold long silver long agriculture position
