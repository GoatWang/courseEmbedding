successful at tuning out the noise in our last essay we wrote given our cynicism of government especially in washington we expect some challenges in policy implementation as the new year begins these challenges in our opinion will provide real opportunities for investor sentiment to change course this reality is upon us   while beltway politics have been challenging as expected our view that market volatility would follow has been completely wrong so far we have just experienced one of the least volatile periods in recent equity market history there were  consecutive trading days without a  decline in the market the longest streak since  this run finally ended march st needless to say the tranquility has been surprising   while washingtons difficulties suggest more political uncertainty one should keep the events in context economic data in the us continues to improve and all of the top global economies are expanding in unison for the first time in a decade we believe that strong us economic fundamentals remain intact multiyear highs in consumer and business sentiment tightening labor markets increasing demand for housing strong consumer balance sheets add a probusiness policy agenda and a reasonable backdrop for sustainable economic growth takes shape longer term these fundamentals will drive the market   while we expect that the economy will grow in the coming year we continue to gird ourselves for increased volatility and the potential for a market pullback we are entering the later stages of a long economic expansion volatility tends to be elevated in the nd half of a business cycle to that end our portfolios are more conservatively positioned we continue to keep some cash on hand and seek out larger higher quality businesses illustrated via two of our more recent purchases   merck mrk large pharmaceutical companies historically go through long periods of time where one company is viewed as the leader in drug technology this position manifests itself in higher growth rates than peers and an accompanying higher valuation from investors for the past decade bristol myers has held this position with its leadership in an emerging class of cancer therapies immunooncology drugs late last summer a highly anticipated immunooncology drug trial conducted by bristolmyers failed this catapulted merck into the leading position in this space we believe the successful trials merck has conducted on their io drug keytruda will change the landscape and leadership in cancer treatment the shift away from radiation and chemo towards io has begun to take mindshare at leading medical institutions   this can be seen by massachusetts general adopting keytrudas biomarker testing in select cancer treatments as their new standard of care   we believe we are at the forefront of change in leadership within the pharma sector as keytruda starts to flow through mercks operating results they will be able to grow earnings faster than their peers and should be rewarded with a premium multiple while we wait for this scenario to play out we own a great global franchise trading at lower than market valuation and we will collect a nearly  dividend yield   occidental petroleum oxy depending on how you categorize the industry occidental is either the smallest major or the largest nonmajor integrated oil exploration and production ep company either way the integrated business that only scale players possess offers unique advantages in the energy space one benefit is the ability to invest throughout the commodity price cycle occidental spent  billion in growth project capital over the past three years due to their integrated business model and historically conservative approach to capital allocation the company was able to do this while also raising the dividend  and maintaining a single a balance sheet   having completed this spending the company is now in the enviable position of harvesting a return on this sizable investment completion of these projects allows the company to focus on deploying their growth capital towards the permian basin here the company has a  acre core position where they have identified over  drilling locations that are profitable with oil below  after doubling their current activity level this will still represent more than  years of drilling inventory   with most investors having thrown in the towel on energy companies after a difficult three year stretch the stock has found no takers in fact despite crude nearly doubling the stock is up only a few dollars from where it was last february when oil was barrel we believe as the price of oil stabilizes and true investors return to the energy industry occidental will be rewarded with a higher share price in the meantime we will happily collect the generous safe and growing  dividend   these are two examples where we were able to find companies that we believe have better than average business prospects but whose stocks are selling at a discount to their peers if our work is correct these companies should be able to increase their free cash flow as they reap the rewards of past investment if the economy or market should weaken then the relatively low valuations strong balance sheets and meaningful dividend yields should help limit our downside   thank you for your confidence and enjoy spring q  reality q  showmetime
